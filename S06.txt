Okay! This is it! We're gonna get married!
Are you sure you wanna do this?
Well, hello, Mrs. Ross!
Well, hello, Mr. Rachel!
Wait! Okay!
Whoa!
Oh my God!
Come on Pheebs! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!
Okay! Okay! Okay!
Oh my God!! Is everybody getting married?!!
N-No running in the chapel!
Hey! Don't you give me any of your-Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
What are you guys doing here?
Ross and Rachel left us a message saying they were getting married! Isn't that why you guys are here?
Yes! Well that-yes.
Why else would we be here?
Well! What happened?! Did we miss it?
We actually missed it.
Well, maybe you wouldn't have had you run in the chapel!
This is insane!
What's the big deal, y'know? It's not like it's a real marriage.
What?!
Yeah, if you get married in Vegas, you're only married in Vegas.
What are you talking about? If you get married in Vegas you're married everywhere.
Really?!
Yeah!
Oh my God!-Eh! Well...
Ohhh!
Why are we in bed together?
I don't know. Do-do you have any clothes on?
Yeah.
Really?!
No! But we-we didn't have...sex-uh, did we? I mean, I don't remember much about last night, it was such a blur.
Oh! I remember laughing! I laughed a lot.
And we didn't have sex.
Ohh, I mean, we were really drunk. I'm just glad we didn't do anything stupid.
Tell me about it.
Mornin' Pheebs. Well, my movie has officially been canceled.
Oh Joey, I'm so sorry. You want some of my breakfast?
Nah, I'm too depressed to eat. I'll probably eat in like 5 minutes. So I guess I'll just fly home with you guys, what time's your flight?
What about my cab?
I don't need that anymore.
No, Joey! You borrowed my cab; you have to drive it back.
I don't want to drive all the way back by myself, I get so lonely. Oh-ooh! How about you come with me?
I don't know, it's such a long trip.
It'll be great! We-we could talk, and play games! Huh? This could be our chance to like renew our friendship.
Are you asking me to have a frenaissance?
Sure?
All right. Although I don't think we need one, I never stopped loving you.
Hi!
Hey.
Hey.
So, has anyone talked to Dr. and Mrs. Geller yet?
Um-hmm, yeah. They left me a message; they should be here any minute.
Where is the waitress?! I'm starving!
It's a buffet man.
Oh, here's where I win all my money back!
Listen, I gotta talk to you.
Sure! What's up?
Monica and I almost got married last night.
Oh my God! That's huge! Wait a minute, why come I wasn't invited? And who was going to be your best man? Don't say, "Ross." Do not say, "Ross."
Look, I just don't think Monica and I are ready to get married yet! Y'know? I mean, I love her and everything but seeing Ross and Rachel coming out of that chapel was like a, like a wake-up call that Monica and I are moving so fast. Y'know? And, how do I tell her without crushing her?
Oh! Tell her she's not marriage material.
What?!
Girls say it to me all the time! And believe me, if she's anything like me, she's just gonna be relieved.
How do I tell Chandler that it's too soon. It's gonna break his heart, he's not gonna think that I don't love him anymore.
Well you don't.
Yes I do!
Good! Good! I was just testing you.
Hi.
Oh hi! Hi! Y'know, we were just talking about bacon.
No, we were talking about tennis. Tennis is more believable.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
What?
Are we gonna talk about what you guys did last night? Or...
I don't know. What do you mean last night? Nothing, nothing uh, happened last night.
Yeah!
Uh-huh! Ross invited us all to watch.
Rach! We weren't gonna miss our friends getting married!
Who got married?!
You did.
What?! Hello! We didn't get married.
No, we didn't get married! That's ridiculous!
We-we-we-I remember being in a chapel.
Oh my God.
I-They would not let us get married when we were that drunk!
No!
They let you get married when you're drunk! Most people who get married in Vegas are drunk!
Hell, I'm drunk right now! What? I can't have a mimosa with breakfast?! I'm on vacation!
What are you guys gonna do?
Well, I guess we just find a divorce lawyer?
Well, I think, I think, Ross already has one. Now, this one's free, right? Because you paid for the first two, so the third one's free.
Laugh it up, but the joke's on you. Because we don't need to get divorced, okay? We we're just gonna get an annulment.
An annulment? Ross! I don't think surgery's the answer here.
Oh-oh, that's your thing.
What?
You're thing. You're thing. Y'know? You're the guy who gets divorced.
Oh yeah!
No-no, that's-that's not my thing! I do not love getting divorced!
Yes you do! This is your third divorce! You love divorce so much you're probably gonna marry it! Then it won't work out and you're gonna have to divorce it, divorcing guy. I'm so drunk.
So, what do you think we should do?
I don't know. But I-I-I know I love you!
I know I love you!
So where are we on the whole going back to the place where they have all the marriages thing? I love you.
That's a good question. Look umm, last night we let the dice decide. Maybe we should leave it up to fate again. I love you!
Yes, we don't get married unless there's a sign! Okay, so say uh, say you roll another eight then there's a definite sign that we should get married.
All right, eight we get married, but 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12 we don't get married.
Sounds great.
Okay.
Coming in, we got a shooter! Money please.
Ready?
Ready!
Come on eight.
Yes, yes eight.
Eight! Easy eight.
Wow! I can't believe I actually rolled an eight.
That was so unlikely. Well, let's get married! I guess.
Wait a minute. That wasn't a hard eight! Last night I rolled a hard eight.
That's right! It was the wrong kind of eight, no wedding! Damnit!
I wanted it so bad! Wanna go pack?
Yeah. We're doing the right thing, right?
Ohh, of course we are! We left it up to fate. If we were supposed to get married there would be a clear-cut sign.
Okay, you have 19 questions left. Use them wisely. Come on Joey! You can't win if you don't ask any QUESTIONS!!!
What?!
Well, you promised me a fun road trip! We've been on the road six hours and you've been asleep for five and a half! We are switching at the next rest stop and you are going to drive all the way back! That will be your punishment, you greedy sleeper!
All right. All right.
Yeah! And until then you are going to sing to me because the radio's broken and you are selfish but have a nice voice.
Really? I don't...
Sing!!
I wanna rock and roll all night!
Man, this is a long drive! Are my eyes open? No!
Morning!
Hey!
Hey, hubby!
Yeah. Yeah, actually um, I wanted to talk to you about that whole annulment thing?
Uh-huh.
I'm not going to do that.
Okay! So, we'll just stay married.
Yes, exactly!
And I will make everyone call me Mrs. Geller!
Wow! This is so amazing. I uh, I really thought I'd have to talk you into this more.
Okay, see now I'm scared because I don't actually think you're kidding.
I'm-I'm not kidding. Look I-I, I can't have three failed marriages. I can't. Okay? I-I am not gonna be that guy!
What-wh-what so we'll just stay married forever?!
Okay, look, how is this gonna affect you? Really? I mean you fill some form out once and a while and instead of checking the box that says Ms you check the box that says Mrs.! It's right next to it!
Ohh, okay, I'm sorry. You're right. Y'know what? We absolutely can stay married, because I was under the impression that the boxes were far away from each other. All right, look, just please, take a moment here and think about what you're asking of me.
I'm asking you to do me a favor.
You are asking me to be your wife!
And as my wife I think you should grant me this favor.
That kid really kicked me hard on the plane.
Well you did pull his hair.
He took my snack!
I'm not getting into this again!
Okay! Oh God, y'know what? It's really bad.
Well, I told you not to walk. Here. There. Okay.
This doesn't mean anything, does it?
No!
Okay.
How could you pick up a hitchhiker?! He could be a rape-, a rapist or a killer or something!
Don't you think I asked him that before he got in?!
Y'know what? I'm not talking to you! You go back to sleep! And you, are you a rapist?!
No!
Do you like car games?
Yeah, y'know the license plate game?
I love the license plate game!
Ooh, I'll play! I'll play!
No-No! You need your sleep. Night-night! Shh!
Hey!
Hey!
Listen, I know you wanted to talk to me, but I have an idea that may make you want to stay married. We register, and you get to keep all the presents!
No! Ross, come on! No! Listen, look I thought a lot about how to tell you this and the bottom line, Ross, is we can not stay married.
I don't know if it's true.
Oh b-b-but it is!
Oh, okay, y'know what this is? This is a difference of opinion. And when that happens in a marriage...
Oh Ross, come on! This is not, this is not a marriage!! This is the world's worst hangover! Ross, listen, if you do not get this annulment, I will!
All right. All right, I'll do it.
Thank you. Hey-hey umm, uh, is there, is there any such thing as an annulment shower?
Wait! Wait! There is the train station!
Oh, okay.
This is where I get off. Well, I have your address and phone number.
And I have your name and the fact that you're a drifter, so the ball's pretty much in your court.
All right, see ya Pheebs.
Come on Pheebs! I can't take this anymore! Let-let me make it up to you. Huh? Ground control to Major Tom. Commencing countdown, engines on. Take your protein pills and put your helmet on!
Stop it! Stop it no! That's not fair! Y'know I can't resist that beautiful voice!
Pheebs, I am so sorry! I know I promised you a fun road trip with your friend and I didn't deliver. But-but-but now I know that you think being awake is an important part of friendship! So, so, so I will strive to-to stay awake for as long as I know you.
You can still sleep at night and stuff.
Well, thank you. So, can we play 20 Questions now? I've got a really good one! I've been thinking about it since Kansas.
Okay. Is it a kind of hot sandwich?
Yes.
Is it a meatball sub?
That is incredible! You are the master!
Huh, that's funny. You look like you're gonna be the...
No, don't say it! Don't even think it!
All right. Okay Chandler, enjoy your handful.
All right, should we just, should we just get married? Y'know? I mean should we just do it? All the signs are telling us to do it.
I'm sick of the signs! It's too fast, I'm happy the way things are!
Me too!
I don't want things to change! Do you?
No!
All right then, then nothing changes! Everything is great! Everything stays the same! And you go unpack because it's been three days and it's driving me insane!
Jeez, relax! It's not like we're mar-ah-ah!!
Y'know I was thinking, what if I uh, unpack here?
Then all your stuff would be here.
Well, what if all my stuff was here?
Then you'd be going back and forth all the time, I mean it doesn't make any sense.
Okay. What if we lived together and you understand what I'm saying?
Live together? There have been no signs for that.
Me asking is kind of a sign.
YES!!!!!!!!
Okay!!!!!
Yes! Okay! Okay! Wait-wait-wait!
Okay.
Here's your key
Oh thanks.
Here's your key. All right, you have to christen it! Now, go out and come back in!
The door hasn't been locked in five years, but okay! Ready?!
Ready!
Okay, a little problem. The key broke in the lock and I can't get in!
Wait! Oh my God! I can't get out!
This is not a sign!
No, it's not a sign! It's a very old key!
It's an old key!
Oh my God it's old!
I love you!
I love you!
Are you hugging the door right now.
No.
Yeah-yeah, me neither.
Hey!
Hey, so did everything go all right with the annulment?
Oh, yeah, no problems. It's all taken care of.
Ross, thank you. Hey, do you guys wanna go see a movie?
Oh yeah, why not?
Pheebs?
No thanks, I've already seen one.
Okay, umm, I'm gonna get my sweater.
Okay. You uh, you wanna hear something weird?
Always.
I didn't get the annulment.
What?!
We're still married! Don't tell Rachel. See you later.
What are you doing?
The key's stuck in the lock.
I can fix it. Hold on. Look out. Look out.
It still doesn't work.
I'm not finished.
Oh.
Nice job Joe! You're quite the craftsmen.
Hey!
Hey, so did everything go okay with the annulment?
Oh, yeah, no problems. It's all taken care of.
Ross, thank you. Hey, do you guys wanna go see a movie?
Oh yeah, why not?
Okay, umm, I'm gonna get my sweater.
Okay. You uh, you wanna hear something weird?
Always.
I didn't get the annulment.
What?!
We're still married! Don't tell Rachel. See you later.
Hey, do you have any gum?
Oh? Yeah! Sure!
Wait! Wait! Hi! Listen, Ross can I just talk to you for just a second?
Oh but Phoebe, we're gonna be late for the movie.
Oh, there's a cab! Taxi!! Good timing, my God, huh? Here you go.
Yeah, we're, we're actually just gonna walk 'cause it's right up there at the Angelica.
Oh, the Angelica!! Go! Go! You didn't get the annulment?!!
I know.
Ross?!
Well, I tried! But when I got to my lawyer's office all I could hear was, "Three divorces. Three divorces!" Look, I just don't want my tombstone to read, Ross Gellar, Three Divorces.
Don't be worried about that! Your tombstone can say whatever you want it to say! It could say, Ross Geller, Good at Marriage! Y'know? Mine's gonna say Phoebe Buffay, Buried Alive.
Look, all I know is I-I can't have another failed marriage!
So okay what? You're gonna be married to a girl who doesn't even know about it?!-Op, woman! Sorry.
Well, okay so, I don't have it all worked out quite yet. Just don't say anything to Rachel, please?
Rachel is one of my closest friends. Although, being the only one who knows anything about this does makes me feel special. Okay!
Okay, stop-stop! Phoebe?!
Hey Rach!
What was that?!
Sorry, mix up. Hey, how was the movie?
I haven't seen it yet!
Well then you'd better hurry! The Angelica! Go! Go!
Noooooooo!!
Y'know when we move in together, can I get a gumball machine?
Of course! Joey wouldn't let you have one?
No. When it comes to sweets, he's surprisingly strict.
Hey, have you figured out a way to tell him you're moving out?
No, no, I keep trying, y'know? I can get out, "Joey, I have too..." but then I lose my nerve and I always finish with, "...go to the bathroom." He may think I'm sick.
Y'know, I really have to tell Rachel, but I... We just have to get it over with! Y'know, the next time we see them we're just gonna tell them. Okay? That's it.
Oh, so that's this is gonna work now? You're just gonna order me around all the time?
Pretty much.
All right.
Hey Monica!
Hi!
Hey man, you feeling any better?
Joey, we have something to tell you.
Oh my God! You're pregnant!
No-o-o! No? No-o-o! Look Joey, here's the thing, Monica and I have decided to live together, here. So, I'm gonna be moving out man.
Wow! Well, uh... Hey! I'm really happy for you guys! Congratulations! See you later.
Wait! Joey! Joey! Are you okay?!
Yeah, I gotta go! I got an acting job. Like you'd believe that. This sucks!
Look, I-I'm just gonna be right across the hall and I promise you, the minute Monica and I break up I'm moving right back in with you!
Okay! Look-look-look, uh, if you're gonna be moving in with him I feel it's my responsibility to tell you the truth about him! Okay? He's a terrible roommate! Terrible! He uh, forgets to umm... Oh-oh he always, he always umm-Oh, who am I kidding! He's the best roommate ever!
Hey Pheebs!
Hey!
Hey, have you seen Rachel?
No, why?
I have some pretty exciting news!
You're pregnant!
No! Chandler and I are moving in together!
Ooh! That's Good! Wow! But Now If You Were Pregnant, What Would You Name It? Hint Phoebe.
Hey! Hi!
Hey!
What's up?
Well umm, Chandler and I are moving in together.
Oh my God. Ohh, my little sister and my best friend...shaking up. Oh, that's great. That's great.
Guys, I'm happy too.
Okay, come here!
Wow! Big day huh? People moving in, people getting annulled...
Okay, I gotta go find Rachel but umm, if you guys see her could you please try to give her some really bad news so that mine doesn't seem so bad?
Bye.
Hmm, something bad to tell Rachel... Bad news for Rachel, what could that be?!
Could ya just, could ya just lay off, please? All right? My life is an embarrassment! I should go live under somebody's stairs!
Ross, it's not that big a deal! So you'll been divorced three times, you'll still have a life, you'll go on dates...
No! No, I won't! I'll be at the bottom of the dating barrel now. The only guys below me will be Four Divorce Guy uh, Murderer Guy, and-and, Geologists.
Ross, you're being ridiculous! Okay? You are cute and smart and sweet and that is much more important than three stupid divorces!
Oh yeah? Have you ever dated anyone who has been divorced three times?
Y'know that's really fair. Y'know? Most guys who have been divorced three times are like 60. Ross, nobody cares about this except you! This-this embarrassment thing is all in your head! Here, I'll show you! Come here.
What?! Why?
Hi! Hi! Listen, my friend Ross is about to be divorced for the third time, but wouldn't you date him?
And if you wait right here, I'll go get Ross.
Hey!
Ugh, I thought you were Rachel!
What gave me away?
I just tell her, I have to get it over with. I told Ross and Phoebe and she's the only one left!
Okay, so that's it, everybody knows! It's official, we're moving in together. No turning back. Are ya scared? Are ya?
No.
Wow that was my scariest voice! You're very brave.
Hey!
Hey.
Ugh, the worse day! Y'know, you think you're making progress at work and then your boss calls you Raquel.
Hey listen, for the first four years of my work everybody called me Sha-la-lap. Seriously.
I believe you. So, it was right in the middle of a staff meeting so of course no one else wants to correct her so everyone else is calling me Raquel! By the end of the day, the mailroom guys were calling me Rocky!
Well, I-I still think you're very-very nice and very pretty...
What?
All yours babe.
Have a seat. Okay, listen umm, Chandler and I are going to live together, here.
Oh my God! That's so great! I'm so happy for you guys!
Really?!
And that was so sweet of you to ask! Oh my God, the three of us are gonna have such a good time living together!
Yes, we are.
And Chandler, you're gonna have to watch those long showers you take in the morning because you know Raquel can't be late.
Rach...
Yeah, he's gonna work on that.
Ohh! This is so exciting! Oh God... Come and knock on my door...
We'll be waiting for you...
...once you know the stories, it's not that bad. First marriage, wife's hidden sexuality, not my fault. Second marriage, said the wrong name at the altar, a little my fault. Third marriage, well they really shouldn't allow you to get married when you're that drunk and have writing all over your face, Nevada's fault.
Okay, so what do you think ladies? Who wouldn't be interested? Who wouldn't want to date him?
Well the divorces don't bother me, I'd date him. But, not while he's still married.
Okay, what about you? Wouldn't you want a date?
Actually, I'm dating at all anymore. See, I figured out that I was only dating guys that were like y'know bad for me, so until I work that out...
Whatever! What about you Meg?
Well, I don't care about the divorces either, but I wouldn't date him. It's just that he's obviously still in love with this Rachel girl.
What?!
She said, "He's obviously still in love with this Rachel girl."
This is crazy! I mean, yes-yes Rachel is my good friend and I-I have loved her in the past, but now, she is just my wife! Phoebe, will you-will you help me out here?
Well, I thought you loved her when you-when you married her.
We were drunk! I would've married uh, Joey with that amount of alcohol!
Hey! You could do a lot worse than Joey Tribbiani!!
Look, I'm sorry, but you guys are wrong. I just don't want to be divorced three times.
Yes, and now he's using this three divorces reason because he wants to stay married to her because he loves her. I must say, "Well done!" Bravo Meg.
Okay! Fine! Fine! If-if this is what you think, forget about the whole three divorce thing! Okay, I-I'll go to my lawyer's office right now and get this marriage annulled! Okay?! Because she means nothing to me! Noth--Nothing!!
Okay now I wouldn't date you because you seem a little creepy.
I am so attracted to him right now.
Okay, when are we gonna tell Rachel what is actually gonna happen?
Soon! I-I just couldn't before. You saw how upset Joey got! I couldn't do that to her, she's my best friend!
Well, Joey's my best friend.
I'm not your best friend?
You just said... Of course you're my best friend. Would you please tell Rachel though?
All right, all right, at least I'm prepared.
Okay. Oh yes.
Hey!
Hey-hey!
These aren't for you! Are you upset?
I am now!
Hey roomie!
Okay, bye!
Rach, there's something uh, important I have to tell you.
Are you pregnant?!
No! But, I'm throwing this shirt away! I think there was a little misunderstanding before.
Um-hmm.
Umm, when I said that uh, that Chandler and I wanted to umm, live together we meant alone together.
Oh my God! Oh, that's funny, I can't believe I did that.
Oh no sweetie, no! This is my fault, I wasn't clear! I'm really sorry. And listen, you take as much time as you need to move out okay? There's absolutely no rush.
Okay.
Okay. Don't you want a cookie?
Sure? Thanks.
Maybe, do you need a tissue?
Monica, where did you get these?!
I made them!
Ooh, good God, they're so yummy!
God, it's gonna so weird like when I come home and you're not here. Y'know? No more Joey and Chan's. No more J and C's. "You wanna go over to Joey and Chandler's?" "Can't, its not there."
Look, I'm just gonna be across the hall, we can still do all the same stuff.
Yeah but we won't be able to like get up in the middle of the night and have those long talks about our feelings and the future.
Not once did we do that.
Hi.
Hey!
Hi.
So I, I told Rachel it was just gonna be the two of us.
Oh yeah? Well, how'd she take it?
Really well. Yeah. Surprisingly well. Yeah, she didn't cry. She wasn't angry or sad.
And you're upset because you didn't make your best friend cry?
I mean, all I'm asking for is just a little emotion! Is that too much to ask after six years?! I mean what? Are-are-are Rachel and I not as close as you guys?! I mean do we not have as much fun?! Don't I deserve a few tears?!! I mean we-we told Joey, he cried his eyes out!
Hey! I did not cry my eyes out!! Come on! It's like the end of an era! No more J-man and Channie's!!
Okay, I gotta ask, who calls us that?!
You got married again.
Yes.
So that's your second marriage in two years.
Yes, second in two years. Third overall.
Ross, I have been a divorce attorney for 23 years and never had I so much business from one client. Why don't you tell me what happened.
Basically, Rachel and I were in Vegas and we got drunk...
I'm sorry, is this the same Rachel who's name you said at the altar in the second marriage?
Yes-yes-yes! But, I-I do not love her.
Oh, that's better then.
This was just a drunken mistake and I need to get it annulled.
I see. Have you considered therapy?
I think just the annulment for today.
There are a couple of forms to fill out.
Easy.
And we'll need to have witnesses who can testify that you were not of uh, sound mind.
No problem.
And we'll need you and Rachel to testify before a judge.
Ooh! There's no way to do this without her? 'Cause I kinda all ready told her uh, it was, it was already taken care of.
Of course you did. Look Ross, you can't get an annulment unless you and Rachel are both there.
Uh-ha, what about someone who looks like Rachel? I will think about the therapy.
Hey!
Hey. So um, I was thinking that maybe we should start dividing up our stuff.
Okay!
Y'know, no point in dragging it out. Dragging out the long process of you moving out and us not living together anymore.
Okay.
Hey Rach, what about this? Huh? Who-who gets this? See, I don't know if I want it because it might be y'know, too many memories!
What the hell is that?
I don't know. Hey, Rachel, you want the big plate? I want you to have the big plate.
Wow! Mon, thanks! I love this plate!
Something to remember me by!
Mon, honey you're not dying. I'm just moving out. Y'know, I mean we're gonna see each other all the time.
But still, it's a big change. The end of an era, you might say!
Are you okay? You're not blinking.
I'm fine! I just, I'm thinking how much it's an end of era.
Oh, all right. But y'know I gotta say, I don't, I don't think six years counts as an era.
An era is defined as a significant period of time. Now, it was significant to me, maybe it wasn't significant to you!
What is the matter with you?!
What is the matter with you?!! Why aren't you more upset?! Aren't you gonna be sad that we're not gonna be living together anymore?! I mean aren't you gonna miss me at all?!
All right, fine, but don't get mad at me. It's-it's just a little hard to believe.
What's hard to believe?
Well y'know, it's you guys. You-you do this kind of stuff! Y'know? I mean, you-you were gonna get married in Vegas and then you backed out! I guess I'm not upset because I don't see you guys going through with it. I'm sorry.
Rachel, it's going to happen. Chandler is gonna move in here.
But I...
No-no, wait! Just let me finish, okay? This isn't something that we just, we just impulsively decided in-in Vegas, this is something we both really want. And it is going to happen.
It is? Really?
Yeah, sweetie.
I mean we're not, we're not gonna live together anymore?
No.
What? Oh my God! I'm gonna miss you so much!
I'm gonna miss you!
I mean it's the end of an era!
I know!
Okay, bye!
Oh no.
So? Did you get the annulment?
I couldn't.
I knew it! Because you love Rachel.
It's not that. Okay? Annulments are more complicated than I...
Yeah, complicated 'cause of the love.
I... I do, I do not love Rachel. I'm gonna tell her right now about the whole thing so we can get this marriage annulled as fast as possible. Okay? Would I do that if I loved her?
I've never been more convinced of your love for her.
I do not have feelings for Rachel! Okay?!
Ohh, what's wrong?!
Monica and Chandler are really moving in here and I have to move out and everything is changing.
Oh my-Come here! Come here! It's okay. Everything's gonna be okay.
Thank you.
Of course.
So, Ross and Rachel got married, Monica and Chandler almost got married, do you think you and I should hook up?
Oh we do, but not just yet.
Really?! Well, when?
Okay umm, well, first Chandler and Monica will get married and be filthy rich by the way. Yeah. But it won't work out.
Wow.
I know. Then, I'm gonna marry Chandler for the money and you'll marry Rachel and have the beautiful kids.
Great!
But then we ditch those two and that's when we get married. We'll have Chandler's money and Rachel's kids and getting custody will be easy because of Rachel's drinking problem.
Oh-oh, what about Ross?
I don't want to go into the whole thing, but umm, we have words and I kill him.
Hey!
Hey! Check it out! This is unbelievable! Joey has been holding his breath for almost four minutes!
Dude! What are yo-you trying to kill me?!
Pheebs, I wanna ask you something.
Uh-huh, what?
Well since I'm movin' out and-and you're so beautiful...
Oh!
...how about I move in with you?
Well, that would be great but then what do we do about Denise?
Who's Denise?
My roommate.
You have a roommate?!
Yes, Denise. Denise!
Hey, what is with the secrecy Phoebe? Huh? And what about this Denise, is she cute?
Pheebs, I don't understand. How can you have a roommate that none of us know anything about?
Maybe because you never listen to anything that I say. I talk about her all the time! DENISE!!!!!
Hey Rach, listen I was thinkin' uh, I'm gonna have an extra room over at my place...
Oh, that's true.
Yeah, why don't you move in with me? It'll be great! We could stay up late, watch movies, and you know about Naked Thursday's right?
Yeah, yeah I think I'm gonna find my own place.
Hey-hey! I thought Naked Thursday's was just our thing man!
Hey.
Hey!
So, what did Rachel say when you told her you were still married to her?
Oh, that. Umm, she took it really well.
You didn't tell her did you?
No.
Of course not, because you're in love with her.
I am not in love with her. She was very upset about having to move out so I eh, didn't tell her we were still married because she would only get more upset. I-I just comforted her, as a friend.
What do you mean, comforted her?
It's nothing, I just gave her a hug.
Ah-ha! A classic sign of love, the hug!
It's also a sign of friendship.
Yeah, not in your case Lovey Loverson.
It was a hug!
Okay, just tell me this, did you or did you not smell her hair?
S-s-smell her hair? What if I did?
Ninety percent of a women's pheromones come out the top of her head! That's why, that's why women are shorter. So that men will fall in love when they hug them! Oh come on Ross, you're a scientist.
I was hugging her as a friend. It's not my fault her-her hair got in my face, she's got a lot of it and it smells all-all uh...coconutty. What?! Oh, that doesn't mean I have feelings for Rachel! Maybe it means I have feelings for coconuts!
Okay, whatever you say. But just be careful, all right? Rachel's not in the same place you are.
If the place you are referring too is being in love, then she is in the same place as me because I am not in that place!
Okay, I didn't understand that, but y'know, maybe that's 'cause you were speaking the secret language of love!
Hey! Dude, some guy just called for you.
Who was it?
I don't know! How about, "Thanks for taking the message." Jeez!
Okay listen, y'know when you move in Rachel's room is gonna be empty, you wanna talk about what we want to do with it?
Sure!
Okay, I was thinking we should have a beautiful guest room, right? With a mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with flowers on them all the time! And we could have a roll top desk with comment cards on them so people could say how much they loved staying here!! Okay, whatever, I really haven't thought about it that much.
Well, I like that idea. Obviously! I was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe it could be a game room, y'know? I mean you can buy old arcade games like uh, like Space Invaders and Asteroids for $200, the real ones! The big-big ones!
No.
Okay so you mean no as in, "Gee Chandler, what an interesting idea. Let's discuss it before we reject it completely."
Oh, I'm sorry. Of course I mean that. Interesting idea, umm, talk about it, but no.
So, that's it?
I just don't think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room. The beautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques.
Which is why Asteroids is perfect! It's the oldest game!
What do you have against the beautiful guest room?
I don't have anything against the beautiful guest room, especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away!
Are you mocking me?
No, I'm not mocking you, or you beautiful guest room.
Hey, what's up?
Nothing, Monica and I had a stupid fight.
But you're still moving in together, right? Because my ad came out today.
"Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly." Nice!
Yeah? I just figured y'know, after living with you it'd be an interesting change of pace to have a female roommate, y'know? Someone I can learn from, someone-someone who's different than me. And what's more different than me; a guy who's not 19 than say a girl who is 19? Enh? Not just a hat rack my friend!
Pheebs, I have to ask you...
Shhhhhh! I'm swamped right now.
You're just staring into space.
Umm, I'm trying to move that pencil.
This one?
It worked!
Pheebs, this whole apartment thing is just a nightmare! Every place I can afford comes with a roommate who is a freak. I mean, look at this; "Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly." It's just, there is nothing! The city's full!
Wait, no, look at this! "Two bedroom, two bath, must be non-smoker, Satan worshipers okay..." Oh, yeah, but it's on the ground floor.
Hey!
Hey.
Rach, uh, you still looking for a place?
Yeah! Why?
Okay, there's this guy, Warren, from the museum and he's going on a dig for like two years and he's got this great place he needs to sublet. So uh, you interested?
That sounds great! I'd love to live at Warren's!! I love Warren! Thank you!
Don't thank me! If you wanna thank something, thank the volcano that erupted thousands of years ago, killing but perfectly preserving an entire civilization. Here's Warren's number.
Oh, this is great! I am gonna call him right now! Oh, thank you!
Okay, you go grab it!
I saw it.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Umm, I'm talking about that which you already know but won't admit. You love her again; you re-love her!
Look, I do not re-love her.
I can't believe you won't just admit it! Okay, just promise me that you won't do anything stupid.
Look, we're just friends now! Okay? Why would I do anything stupid?
Ugh!!! Well, the apartment is already subletted! I mean, this is just hopeless. I'm never gonna find anything.
You can live with me.
What?!
What?!
What?
Oh my God! Are you serious?!
Uh-huh.
I would love to live with you Ross; that's-that's great! Thank you!
Well, I'm-I'm just glad I could, y'know, help you out.
Wow! I'm-I'm so happy for you guys. This is so-so, not stupid.
Ross-Ross, you have no idea what this means to me! I mean, I mean I was gonna be homeless. You just saved me! You're my hero!
Hero, I uh, I don't know-well, all right.
Oh, I have to go tell Monica what a wonderful brother she has!
Oh please! You're gonna say things now, aren't ya?
No. No, I won't. But I should tell you this, this exact same thing happened to my roommate Denise. She moved in with a guy who was secretly married to her and he said he didn't love her, but he really did, and it just blew up! And that's how she ended up living with me! Okay, that's a lie.
Hi.
Hi.
Hi, listen, I'm sorry about before. I don't need to have a game room. I mean when I was a kid I only played those games because I couldn't get girls, and now I can 'em-Now, I have you. Not-not that I think that I have you or think of you as property in any sort of way, I see women...
Stop it Chandler. I'm sorry too.
Really?
Yeah! Oh yes!
Ohh.
Listen, we don't have to make that a guest room, we can think of something to do with the room together.
That's a great idea! We can easily think of a way for us both to enjoy the room.
Totally!
We don't have to come up with this now.
Oh good.
Hey, y'know what? Why don't we think about changes we can make in the living room?
Changes?
Yeah, I mean we're gonna have to move around some furniture to make room for my chair.
You're-you're-you're gonna bring the Barca Lounger over here?
Is that a problem?
Well, it's a set and they should probably stay together.
Oh, that's cool. Then I'll just bring them both over.
See now-now you're taking them away from their home.
Okay, I get it. So, I get nothing! Nothing here is mine! Everything here is yours! I'll get up in the morning put on your clothes, and head off to work!
Yeah-yeah, y'know what? Yeah, that's it-that's it, everything will be mine! Nothing will be yours! That's-that's what I said! Oh come on, Chandler! I'm talking about the barca lounger! It just, it doesn't match! Where is it gonna go?!
In the game room!
Look it is not my fault that your chairs are incredibly ugly!
All right! That's fine! That's fine! I won't bring over the chairs! I won't bring anything over! I wouldn't want to ruin the ambiance over here at Grandma's place!!
Everything on your application looks really good-Ohh! Just one last question umm, are you and your friends gonna be over here all the time like partying and hanging out?
Oh don't worry, I'm not really a party girl.
Whoa!! Now look, don't be just blurtin' stuff out. I want you to really think about your answers. Okay?
You can call off the roommate search! Hi! I'll be living here.
Oh don't listen to him, he's just some guy who really wants the apartment, but I don't think he's gonna get it.
Why did you take the shower curtain down?
That thing was a hazard! I'm very safety conscious.
Hey!
Hey! Oh listen, I was just clearing some space for your stuff.
Oh thanks, but listen, I was just at Monica's and she and Chandler had a big fight and they're not moving in.
What do you mean, they're not moving in? They-they're still moving in right?
No-no, they just had a big blowout over what to do with my room.
What?! Over a stupid room!
Yeah, I feel kinda bad for them, but I'm also really psyched 'cause I don't have to move in here!
Oh no, yeah no, that part's great!
What's all this about you guys fighting?! Is this really over a room?! I mean, that is so silly!
Ross, we can handle this.
Well, apparently not, and I can't just stand by and watch two people I care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly. I mean, enough of the silliness!
Well, why don't you tell her to stop being silly!
Okay-okay! Two very good points, look I've known you both a long time, and I've never seen either of you one/millionth as happy as you've been since you've got together. Do you really want to throw that all away over a room? That is so silly. Now wh-what is more important, love or silliness?
Well, we are fond of the silliness, but we also have a soft spot for the love.
Love is the best medicine.
That's laughter.
Why do you do it?
I don't know.
Okay! All right! Now, Chandler you-you wanna live with Monica, right?
Yeah, I do.
And Mon, you wanna live with Chandler, don't ya?
Yes.
Good! A verbal contract is binding in the state of New York!
So I understand you're looking for a place.
No-no, I'm staying put.
Oh, I was going to offer you my apartment.
Why, where are you going?
I don't know.
Hey Rach!
Hi!
You're never gonna believe it uh, Monica and Chandler are moving in again. That's great news right-I mean for them. Right?
Oh wow.
Yeah but, on the bright side, we get to be roommates again.
Yeah. Y'know umm, uh, umm, about that, umm, Ross I really appreciate your offer to let me move in and everything, but don't you think it's gonna be weird?
Wh-why?! Why-why-why would it, why would it be weird?
Well, because of us! Because of our history.
No!
No?
No! No! It would be weird if we were still in that place, I mean are you still in that place?
No! Not at all!
Good! Me neither! So it's not a problem. We're just two friends who happen to be roommates.
Okay, but Ross, eventually you and I are gonna be dating.
Really?! We are?
Yeah! I'm gonna have a boyfriend, you're gonna have a girlfriend...
Ohh! That would be great.
But y'know what, if you think it's gonna be okay we'll just work out a system. Y'know, it'll be like college, I'll hang a hanger on the door and put a sign, "Come back later, I'm gettin' lucky."
Yeah, I didn't think of that.
So are you sure about this whole moving in thing?! I mean it's a really big step! And-and what's the rush?!
That's very funny!
He's being silly, because he knows that we enjoy the silliness!
No, I-I-I'm serious, okay? I mean, think about it. You move in, you start fighting over stupid game rooms, next thing y'know you break up!
Ross, you were right before, it was just a stupid fight about a room.
Okay, there are no stupid fights!! This isn't about the room, this is about what the room...represents! And unfortunately, this room could destroy you!!
Yeah, I'm not so worried.
Yeah, no, me neither.
Fine! It's your life! I just don't want to see you guys break up! Which you will do if you move in together, but that's what you want, there's nothing I can do. DON'T DO IT!!!!!
You still want to move in together right?
Of course!
Ross didn't scare you?
Scared me out of ever wanting to live with him.
Come here, I want to show you something!
Okay!
Oh my God! Someone's killed Square Man!
This is where I thought the barca lounger could go! You see you could see the TV and it's still walking distance to the kitchen.
Oh that's so sweet! I want to show you something too!
Okay!
Y'know those big-big uh, road signs that say "Merge?"
Uh-hmm.
Y'know? So I was thinking that we could get one of those signs and hang it over our bed. Because, that's you and I together! Merge!
Oh my God! I love that!
Really?!
Uh, no!!
I found you in my bed! How'd you whined up there? You are a mystery! Little black curly hair! Little black curly hair! Little black, little black, little black, little black, little black curly hair............
Now if you want to receive e-mails about my upcoming shows, then please give me money so I can buy a computer.
So umm, where are the other guys?
Umm, well let's see Monica and Chandler are occupied.
Fighting?!
No, the other thing. I really think it's great they work things out.
Yeah. There's no breaking them up, is there?
Hey, can I borrow the key to your house so I can run across the street and make a copy?
Sure! Here.
Thank you. Now are you sure? Because once I make a copy, there's no turning back.
Yeah, I'm-I'm sure. Yeah, get out of here before I change my mind.
Umm, listen, Ross do you really think this moving in with Rachel is a good idea?
I've been back and forth.
Yeah well, maybe you should go back! Okay? Rachel moves in, and before you know it you're right where you don't want to be! Back together!
Ehh, I don't, I don't think so. She's already talked about y'know, dating other guys.
That's not gonna work out! Then she's gonna come home all weepy and you'll be tellin' her, "Oh that's okay. You'll find someone." And then, bamn! She finds you!
Yeah, well, m-maybe you're right.
I am telling you Ross, she is definitely gonna fall in love with you again! Now, is that what you want?
Is that what I want?
Yes.
Here she comes. Hold on, I'm gonna make your life much easier.
All right, well the place was closed. I'll just copy it later.
Or not. Uh, Rach, why don't you just move in with me?
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, Joey!
No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no... It's okay, I mean I-look Rach, I know I scared you off with that whole Naked Thursday's thing, but we don't have to do that!
Well, it would be easier to move just right across the hall. Wait a minute, unless you're thinking about Naked Wednesday's.
Thursday's clearly not good for ya, pick a day!
Hi!
Hi!
Come in. Thanks for comin' back, umm, okay there have been a lot of people interested in the room, but I have narrowed it down and you are one of the finalists!
Great!
Okay now, before I make my final decision I uh, I just want to make sure our personalities match. Okay, so I made up a little test. Now, I'm gonna say a word and then you say the first thing that comes to mind.
I can do that.
Okay! Here we go. Pillow.
Fight.
Very good! Okay. G.
String?
Excellent! Okay umm, doggy.
Kitten?
Ooh, sorry! No-no-no, so close though, but-bye-bye!
So, which of this kitchen stuff is mine?
This bottle opener.
And?
And it's a magnet!
Look at that!
How weird is that? Y'know? You're moving in with me and have the one thing I don't have. It's like uh, in a way you-you complete me kitchen.
What?!
You complete me kitchen, matey!
Ross, I know what you're thinking.
What?
That she's gonna move in with you and maybe then she'll fall in love with you and then when she finds out you're already married, she'll just be happy. Y'know? You're just, you're very sad.
Oh...my...God! I-I see what this is! You are in love with Rachel!
What?!!
Of course! It all adds up! I mean you you're obsessed with her. It's always, "Ross, what are you gonna do about Rachel?" "Ross, why-why are you moving in with Rachel?" "When are you gonna confess your secret marriage to Rachel?" You want her!
No!
Uh-oh, saved by the bell. Hello?
Hey Rach, aren't these candlesticks mine?
No-no, I bought those.
Ohh! Yeah, I forgot.
Yeah.
That you're a liar.
No-no-no, that's great! I'll be there Monday. And thank you again! Okay. Umm, that was the head of the Paleontology department at N uh, Y, uh U!
Wow! Uh what, did he uh, say?
Well remember that paper I had published last year on sediment flow rate, huh? They loved it.
Well, who wouldn't?!
I know! Anyway, they asked me to be a guest lecturer! I mean it's temporary, but uh, if they like me it could lead to a full time job. How great would that look great on a mailbox, huh? "Professor Geller."
Yeah, Professor and Mrs.
And Mrs.?!
Oh! Yeah, y'know you and Ross are still married.
What?!!
Just kidding!
Ohh! Oh God!
Saved your ass.
Hey!
Hi.
Hey!
Oh, what's the matter?
Well, you know that psychic I see?
Yeah?
Well, she told me that I'm gonna die this week, so I'm kinda bummed about that.
What?!
Yeah, and I know you guys don't know a lot about psychic readings, but that one is pretty much the worse one you can get.
Phoebe that's crazy!
I can't believe she would say that too you.
Yeah honey you don't believe her do you?
I don't-she said y'know that I'd have triplets! But she also said one of them would be black.
Just out of curiosity did she tell you how you're gonna go?
No, 'cause she didn't tell me I was gonna die until the very end of the session, and I was not gonna waste a whole another hour there! I mean I've only got a week left, y'know? I've really gotta start living now! , leans back, and starts reading.)
Hey everyone!
Oh hi!
Hey uh, well, today's my first lecture and I kinda wanted to try it out on you guys, do you, do you mind?
Oh that'd be great. Sure!
"There are three primary theories concerning sediment flow rate. Each of these theories can be further subcategorized into two distinct..."
Oh, this is it. This what's gonna kill me.
"...subcategories. The first of these subcategories is..."
Uh Ross! Are there uh, are there naked chicks on that piece of paper?
No! Why?
Well, I've just never seen a guy stare so hard at a piece of paper that didn't have naked chicks on it.
Ohh! Okay! Okay. "There are three primary theories concerning sediment flow rate. Each of these theories can be further subcategorized into..."
Why don't you open with a joke?
Open with a joke? It's a university, not a comedy club!
Wait a minute, hold the phone! You're not talking about Chuckles University?!
Okay!
Ohh! We're kidding! Oh, we're kidding!
Ross, hey you know what might make it less boring?
Thank you!
Some uh, some visual aides.
Oh-ooh-ooh! Y'know what's a good visual aide?
Please don't say naked chicks.
Why not?!
I-I-I don't even know why I bother to talk to you guys about it. Y'know what? I'm just gonna do it on my own with no naked chicks.
That's the way I did it 'til I was 19.
Hey.
Hey! Any good mail?
Yes, you got something from the Screen Actor's Guild.
Ooh, it's probably a residual check, hey can you open it for me, I'm kinda....
"Benefits lapsed."
Hmm that's weird. I don't remember being in a move called benefits lapsed.
Okay, it's not a check. They're saying your health insurance expired because, you didn't work enough last year.
Let me see that!
All right.
Oh, I can't believe this! This sucks! When I had insurance I could get hit by a bus or catch on fire, y'know? And it wouldn't matter. Now I gotta be careful?!
I'm sorry man, there's never a good time to stop catching on fire.
All right well, I guess I gotta go get a job. I'm gonna go see my agent.
Okay, make sure you look both ways before you cross the street.
...look both ways before you cross the street.
Hey!
Hey Pheebs, you're still alive! How are you doing?
Ugh, it's so exhausting waiting for death. Ohh, by the way, do you think you could-
Pheebs, what-what are you doing?
I was preparing you for my-didn't you think I was dead? Did that not come off?
Oh yeah, scared the hell out of me. I thought we'd lost you forever. Pheebs, you lie down?
Yeah, thanks. And listen, can you do me a favor? Could you just umm, wake me up in a couple hours, y'know if you can.
Monica!
Hmm?
Did-did you take these back?
No-no, I-I just, I liked them so much that I went out and bought some for myself.
Oh yeah, they're really great! Aren't they?
I loved them!
Yeah. Nice try!
Hello!
Hey!
Hey!
How'd the lecture go?
It went great! And I didn't need any jokes or naked chicks either!
Wow, that's great Ross, I'm sorry we weren't more supportive before.
I knew all I had to do was let the material speak for itself. Everyone's all, "Ross you have to be funny and sexy." Well, I proved them wrong! And now, I'm gonna pass the news onto Joey and Chandler.
That you're not funny or sexy?
That's right!
Hey Estelle, listen...
Well! Well! Well! Joey Tribbiani! So you came back huh? They think they can do better but they all come crawling back to Estelle!
What are you talkin' about? I never left you! You've always been my agent!
Really?!
Yeah!
Oh well, no harm, no foul.
Estelle, you gotta get me some work. I-I lost my health insurance.
All right, first thing we gotta do, damage control.
Why?
Well, I think uhh, someone out there may have been bad mouthing you all over town.
Bastard!
Hey!
Hey! So Estelle lined up a bunch of auditions for me tomorrow and I'll have my health insurance back in no time.
That's great, but shouldn't you be on the toilet right now?
What?!
What's wrong with you?
Nothing! Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, haven't been able to stand up since. But um, I don't think it's anything serious.
This sounds like a hernia. You have to-you-you go to the doctor!
No way! 'Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything it's gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach!
That's a hernia.
Why did I have to start working out again? Damn you 15s!
Well, we're a little early, the lecture doesn't end for 15 minutes.
Yeah, but y'know we could sneak in and watch.
Yeah, we could. Oh hey look! There's some Kappa Kappa Deltas! I was a Kappa. Hey sisters! Wow, we really are bitches.
Right! So when Rigby got his samples back from the laboratory he made a startling discovery! What he believed to be igneous, was in fact sedimentary. Imagine his consternation when- Oh bloody hell.
What the hell are you doing?!
Look, I was nervous! You guys had me all worried I was going to be boring! I got up there and they were all like staring at me. I opened my mouth and this British accent just came out.
Yeah, and not a very good one.
Will you-will you please?
Dr. Geller, Kurt Rathman, I'm a professor in the paleontology department here.
Oh.
Do you have a moment to talk about your lecture?
I'm sorry, I've got plans with my sister.
Monica Gellerrr.
Right, will you excuse us for one moment? What are you doing?
Oh, you can have an accent and I can't?! Top 'O the morning to ya laddies!
Just please stop!
Yes, yes, Bombay is bery, bery nice time of year.
Hey, will you grab me a cruller? Sit down! Will you go to the hospital?!
Dude! Hernia operations cost like, a lot probably. Besides it's getting darker and more painful, that means it's healing.
I will loan you the money. Just go to the hospital and let's just get that thing...pushed back in.
Thank you, but it would take me forever to pay you that money back and I don't want that hanging over my head. Okay? Besides, as soon as my insurance kicks in I can get all the free operations I want! Yeah, I'm thinking I'll probably start with that laser eye surgery too.
Hey!
Hey.
Hey!
What's going on?
Oh Joey's got a really bad hernia, but that's nothing a little laser eye surgery won't fix!
Look, I'm telling you if I put my hand on my stomach right here it doesn't hurt that bad.
Hey! Maybe you'll die!
Sure, now I'm scared.
No, we can go together! Just don't wait too long though, okay? 'Cause I'm outta here sometime before Friday.
Yeah, but I don't wanna die!
No-no, it'll be fun! We can come back and we can haunt these guys!
Gimme 'em!
No! They are mine!
You stole them from me!
You stole them from me!!
Gimme them!
You just wanna each take one?
Yeah that seems fair. We never use them.
Look, I really need some help, okay? Why? Why did I have to speak in a British accent?! What do I do?
Well...
Why don't you phase it out? Yeah, fade the accent out and people will think you're, y'know, that you're adjusting to life in America.
Yeah, I mean, come on Ross, no one will even notice. I mean they're probably not even listening!
They're not listening too me?
Of course they're listening to you! Everybody listens to you.
Monica you really think I should try this phasing out thing?
I think you look fine.
Whenever you're ready.
Okay. "Hey, Timmy, I've got a surprise for you."
Hold it. I'm sorry, the surprise is a new swing set, if you could play it a little less...intense?
Oh yeah, sure, no problem, I'll just-hold on one second. "Hey Timmy, I've got a surprise for you!"
Oh my God!!
So that's why I feed my dog Purina One! Pick up a bag today!
That's where you pick up the bag.
Exactly.
No, the line is pick a bag, so you need to pick up the bag.
Or, I could just point to it! Huh? Blah, blah, blah, Purina One, point to a bag today. I didn't get it, did I?
No.
Yeah, okay.
Hi. I'm Joey Tribbiani; I'm here to audition for man.
You mean dying man?
Yes!
Okay, come on, do it one more time!
Really? Really?!
Yes!
Okay! "Hello Ross, this is Dr. McNeeley from the Fake Accent University, we'd like you to come on board with us full time!
Hey!
Hey!
Listen to this! My reading was wrong, I'm not going die!
Really?! How do you know?
Because my psychic is dead! She must've read the cards wrong!
Oh, I'm sorry.
Eh, better her than me! Hey, let's bake cookies!
Listen, I'm really glad you got the part.
Thank you.
But are you sure you can do this?
Yeah! And hey, thanks for coming with me. And thanks again for helping me take a shower.
Now, is that never talking about it again?!
Hiya!
Hey Joey, we're ready for ya! Joey, this is Alex he's going to be playing your son.
Hi Alex! And uh, as you can see my hands are not in my pants.
Okay. All right uh, Alex now when Joey says his line, "Take good care of your Momma son," that's your cue to cry. Got it? All right, let's do this.
Scene 5, take 1.
And Action!
"Take could care of your Momma son." "Take could care of your Momma son." "Come on son! Your Momma's good people!"
Cut! Alex, remember you're supposed to cry. Can you cry for us this time?
Okay.
All right, from the top.
Scene 5, take 2.
Take 36 is up!
All right! Let's try this again! You ready Joe?
Ah, just one thing umm, is it all right with you if I, if I scream right up until you say action?
Uh sure.
Okay.
Action!
"Take good care of your Momma son."
Cut!!!!!!!!!!
I'm sorry! Hey-hey Joe, why don't you uh, lift up your shirt? Take a look at this kiddo. We have a crying child! Roll the damn cameras!
Hello?
Hello, is Ross there?
Uh no, he's not. Can I take a message?
Yes, this Russell, Ross's divorce lawyer, just tell him that since I haven't heard from him, I assume he's decided to give the marriage a try.
Ross got married again-Nooooooo!!!!!!!!!
All right, keep going. We are phasing the accent out, phasing it out. So without out re-testing the results in the laboratory the team would never have identified the initial errors in their carbon dating analysis . Were there any questions at this point? Yes.
What's happening to your accent?
Come again? What's-what's this nonsense? All right, I'm-I'm not English. I'm from Long Island. I was really nervous and the accent just uh, just came out. I'm sorry. So, if we could just get back to the lecture. Umm, were there any questions? About paleontology. All right, look I was just trying to make a good first impression. Obviously, I screwed up. But what you guys think of me is really important because I'm-I'm hoping to get a permanent job here. So if you just give me another chance to make a good impression...
Ross!! Are you crazy?! I am still your wife!! What, were you just never gonna tell me?!! What the hell is wrong with you?!!!! Ugh, I could just kill you!!!!
Well, hello Rachel!
Have you really done this before?
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! You just take a big, big swing. Now, don't hold back. and Phoebe picks up a wooden baseball bat and starts to swing as Chandler and Monica enter.)
Hey!
Hey-hey-hey!
What are you doing?
We're just celebrating that Joey got his health insurance back.
Oh, all right.
I cannot believe that you didn't tell me that we are still married!!
Look I was going to tell you!
When?! After the birth of our first secret child?! Ross didn't get the annulment; we are still married.
What?
You're kidding!
Oh my God!!
Ross!
Okay, maybe it wasn't my best decision. But I just couldn't face another failed marriage.
Okay, let me just jump in and ask, at what point did you think this was a successful marriage?
Rach, come on, if you think about it, it's actually kinda funny. Okay, maybe it's best not to think about it.
Okay, this is inexcusable. I am shocked to my very core!
Phoebe, I told her you already knew.
Another lie. You have a sickness!
Ross, just for my own piece of mind, you're not married to anymore of us are ya?
Oh! Hey, somebody left their keys. Ooohh, to a Porsche! Hey Gunther, these yours?
Yeah, that's what I drive. I make four bucks an hour, I saved up for 350 years!
Na-uh! Hey did anybody lose their keys?
Joey, why don't you put them in the lost and found?
There's a lost and found? My shoe!
You left a shoe here?!
Well, I didn't realize until I got home. I wasn't gonna walk all the way back down here with one shoe! Y'know what? I'm gonna go find that guy's car and leave a note on the windshield.
Oh good, when he comes back for his keys, I'll be sure to give him your shoe.
Great! Thanks.
Oh, good, good, you guys are here! Listen, how would like to spend tomorrow taking care of three incredibly cute little puppies?!
Oh my God, what a fun day! That sounds great!
Yeah, all right.
Okay, well I'll bring them by tomorrow morning. Okay, and uh, by the way, they're not actually puppies, they're Frank and Alice's triplets. Okay, see ya!
Whoa-whoa-whoa! What?
Please! Please! Please! Please! Oh please! Please! Please! Frank and Alice asked me to baby sit the triplets and I'm nervous 'cause I've never done that before by myself!
Don't worry about it Phoebe, we'll absolutely do it.
Yeah, I'm gonna pass. 'Cause I was kinda iffy when it was puppies.
Come on Chandler, come on! It'll give us great practice for when--people with babies come to visit.
Nice car!
Yeah, it's not mine.
I love your car.
Yeah, it's mine.
I bet it's fast.
Me too! Yeah. And comfortable. Do uh, do you like leather seats?
Yeah!
It's got 'em!
So, I still have boxes here. I still have boxes at Ross's, and I have nowhere to live! Wow. I could so easily freak out right now.
What about me? I just found out that Denise is leaving town for a while, I don't have a roommate.
Well, maybe-maybe I could be your roommate Pheebs.
Maybe you could be my roommate!
Well there's an idea!!
Yeah!
That would be great! Wait, how long is Denise gone for?
Umm, she said she'd be back December 26th.
December 26th, huh maybe she's Santa Clause.
Oh look who it is, my husband. The apple of my eye.
Okay, I got us a court date for tomorrow at 2:00 and I picked up all the forms. I'll take care of everything.
Well sure, if you say you're gonna take care of everything I have no reason to doubt you. Give me those forms! All right, now I'm gonna do this my way and I don't want to hear a peep out of you!
Okay Rach, but...
Op! You're peeping!
Ross! Y'know what, I just got-why? Why did you do this?!
Look I told you...
I don't wanna hear "Three failed marriages!"
Look, if you'd had two failed marriages, you'd understand!
Well, y'know what? Thanks to you I'm half way there! Ugh! Oh! I am so mad! Ross, I don't think I have ever been this angry!
What about the time I said we were on a break?
Ugh!
Pheebs, how's it going?
I'm doing okay. I think it's going well. Do you think they're having fun? Am I talking to fast?
Nope, sound like me. Pheebs, it's going great. Look at Chandler with little baby girl Chandler.
Little baby girl Chandler, where I have heard that before? Oh right, Coach Ruben. Do you know what Pheebs? When you're done over there, we kinda have a situation over here too.
Na-uh, no, we are all responsible for our own babies.
See that's where I think that you're wrong. We've been playing these babies man for man; we should really be playing a zone defense.
What do you mean?
I just think that things would go a lot smoother if we each have our own zone. Phoebe, you can be in charge of wiping. And y'know Mon, you can be in charge of diapering and I can be in charge of looking how cute they are when they put their hands around...
That sounds really great, but maybe you should be in charge of wiping.
Okay, I'm a rookie. I should not be in the end zone.
This is so great! This is exactly how we set the plates at the restaurant.
Yeah? Well this is not what I ordered.
Hey guys!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey babies! Oh, I'm having the best morning. That uh, that Porsche I've got the keys too, still there!
Shocking! Since you still have the keys.
You should see the treatment I get when I'm with that car! People are friendly; they-they wanna talk, and not just about the car! One guy gave me advice about my equity investments.
What equity investments?
The ones that got me the Porsche! Will you keep up! But I figured, if-if people keep seeing me just standing there, they're gonna start to think that I don't own it. So I figured I'll wash it. Right? Monica, you got a bucket and some soap I can borrow?
Oh yeah, I got soap and sponges and rags and Carnuba wax and polishing compound.
You don't even have a car!
I know. But umm, one time there was this really dirty car in front of the building, so I washed it.
And?
And six others.
There you are.
Yeah, she tops out at 130.
Wow!
And that's just in the city. I get her up to 160 when I take her upstate.
Really! You got a place upstate?
Sure!
Well, I'll see you later.
Okay, take it easy.
Hey! That's my car.
Really? Oh uh, oh just give me five more minutes with it.
What-what are you doing?
Oh I-I uh, found the keys and now I'm just polishing her up.
But it's my car!
Yeah, but it's my wax.
Listen, I-I-I don't come to this city much so I don't know if you're crazy or this is some kind of street theater, but could I have my keys.
Sure. Here. I'll uh, save your parking spot.
I'm not coming back.
Why not?
I live upstate.
Yeah, so did I.
I don't know why I was so nervous about this. And I don't know why Frank and Alice are always complaining. This is so easy.
Yeah, two hours, a lifetime that's the same.
Check it out! Check it out! When the babies wake up, they can meet Krog!
Chandler, what are you doing? That thing can put someone's eye out!
He can do more than that! He can destroy the universe!
No Chandler, they can swallow one of those little parts! And also, look at his smooth area, that's just gonna mess them up.
They're not gonna swallow anything, you guys are being way over protective. When I was a kid, my mom used to just throw me into a pile of broken glass!
What?!
Glass, sand, whatever.
Oh, look at little Leslie stretching in her sleep.
Oh it's so cute. I wonder what age it is when you stop being able to put both legs over your head.
Oh, I can still do that.
How are you still single?!
All right. I thought about it and maybe you're right. Maybe Krog is not a safe toy.
Good. What made you change your mind?
I swallowed the sonic blaster gun.
How did that happen?!!
Well, I was trying to prove that I was right. Y'know? And it turns out I was wrong. And now it's lodged in my throat.
Damnit! Y'know this whole time we were concentrating on watching the babies and, and no one was watching Chandler!
Okay you two are asking the court for an annulment?
Yes your honor, and here are, are forms, all filled out.
So based on your petition you are seeking an annulment on the grounds that Mr. Geller is mentally unstable.
Fine, I'm mentally unstable.
And based on the fact that Mr. Geller is intravenous drug user.
What?!
Uh yes, heroin and crack.
Crack isn't even an intravenous drug!
Well, you would know.
Now it also says here that you lied about your sexual preference before marriage?
Oh, come on!
Ross, please, I found the magazines!
And finally that you were unable to consummate the marriage. Well, that makes sense since you're gay and addicted to heroin.
Okay, I'm sorry, this is insane! I-I-I'm not addicted to heroin, I'm not gay, and there is no problem with my ability to consummate anything! Look, I'll consummate this marriage right here, right now!
That won't be necessary.
And when we were dating we consummated like bunnies!
Ugh!
Now if you were two involved in a serious relationship, that really creates a problem.
Ross! Your honor, rest assured relationship ended like two years ago! And could you strike "Consummated like bunnies" from the record?
Is there, anything in this record that is actually true?
Well, yes, we got married in Vegas and uh, and the names I think.
Well, based on what I heard, you two certainly don't qualify for an annulment. If you two don't want to be together you'll have to file for divorce.
That's great! Are you happy now? Look what you did with your funny, funny form!
What?! Me?! What about you and your consummated like bunnies nonsense!
And what--What are you typing that for? Did you hear what she said? We don't get the annulment. Don't type that! What?! Stop typing! Hey! Stop typing! Stop typing! Stop typing!!
Okay, do you see, do you see what you're keeping me married too?!
You need to get out of my chambers.
All right look lady here is the deal, I came here for an annulment and I am not leaving here until I get one!
Yeah!
Would you like to spend the night in jail?
And thank you for your time.
So the Porsche guy took his car back.
But you found the keys to his clothes?
No. No, I just uh, I just loved the way it feels when everybody thinks I own a Porsche.
And people will think you own a Porsche because you're wearing the clothes?
Of course! Only an idiot would wear this stuff if you didn't have the car! Right?
That is true.
Yeah, but only a genius would swallow a sonic blaster gun.
Oh, I've been there. Yeah, I am gonna go drive my Porsche.
Joey, you know you don't actually have one.
Come on! What are you doing?! I'm in character! Would you talk to her!
Ahh, I think it just moved. It's really poking me.
All right, that's it, we're going to the emergency room.
What?! No, you can't, you can't leave me here with them! We're baby-sitting!
The babies are asleep, I'm sure you'll be okay on your own for a while!
But you-you can't leave me with them! We-we're a team! We're playing a zone! They're gonna triple team me!
He's got something plastic lodged in his throat, we've got to go to the hospital.
But no, because a doctor won't be able to help him, it's just gonna y'know naturally pass through his system in like seven years.
I think that's gum.
I'm pretty sure it's gun.
Okay, listen this really hurts. Let's go.
A real man wouldn't just run to the hospital! No! What would, what would Krog do?
Why isn't that valet back with my Porsche?
Maybe because you've got the keys?
Porsche.
This is totally your fault!
My fault?! You threatened the judge!
Well, you ripped the paper out of the court reporter's machine!!
That was the only way I could get him to stop typing!
Hi! How are the Gellers?
Don't call us that!
The judge wouldn't let us get an annulment! Now we gotta get a divorce!! Did a Porsch throw up on you?
Hey! It's Porsche!!
Me taking care of you is no problem, huh? You guys feel safe. Right? Okay, I'm gonna take that spit bubble as, "Yeah, I do!" Okay, after I get rid of this dirty diaper Leslie, I'll set you up with a clean one. Okay, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. I just have to clean that up. Okay? 'Cause let's face it, we're at Monica's. I broke it. All right. Well, that's just the way that goes. Okay, good. Why are there only two of you? Where is Leslie? Well, you can't answer. Leslie? Where are you Leslie? Leslie, now would be a good time for your first words! Well, look at you! Hey! You are a little bit mischievous! My gosh! Oh, you're a lot mischievous! Well, it'll dry. Okay, you sit with your brother and sister now-who aren't there!
Hey!
How do you feel?
Well, let's just say that Krog will be fully equipped to destroy the universe again in twelve to fourteen hours.
Okay, so I totally took care of the babies all by myself! I fed 'em, bathed 'em, and put 'em to bed.
And protected them from a tornado?
Oh my God.
I know, the babies are asleep.
Phoebe, what, what happened here?!
I did it! I took care of the babies all by myself!
But my apartment!
Was the setting of Phoebe's triumph.
But the mess!
Is not as important as the fact that Phoebe took care of the babies all by herself.
You're right, you're right I shouldn't freak out. 'Cause this is what will happen when you and I have babies! When will that be?!
Phoebe, would you take a look at this mess!!!!
Oh honey thank God you're home, I was getting worried.
I picked up the divorce papers. Uh, I've already signed everything and I put little 'X's where you need to sign.
Oh, little 'X's! Great! That makes up for everything!
Y'know, I-I-you've done a lot of stupid stuff too! Okay?
Oh, name one stupid thing that is as stupid as this one!
Okay, how about you flew to London to stop my wedding! Ah, how about you told me you loved me after I was already married!
Hey! Wait a minute! That was different! I did those things because I was in love with you!
Yeah! Right!
You're right. That's very different. So let's, let's just sign the papers. All right? What?
Nothing.
Okay, can we just sign please?
Uh-hmm.
Congratulations.
Okay Ross, we're-wait a minute. Umm, I uh, I kinda have a little confession.
What?
Well, y'know this whole marriage thing, kinda my idea.
Excuse me?
Well, remember how we were too drunk to remember anything the night we were married?
Yeah?
And uh, yeah, I didn't really, I didn't want to say anything, but it kinda it just, it kinda kept coming back to me, and umm, remember we were in the casino and for some reason thought it would be funny to eat a lot of grapes. And uh, and I thought it would be funnier if we got married. So as a, as a compromise we decided first to get married, and then to eat a lot of grapes. So umm, sorry I got us into this mess.
So then if-if-I mean if you think about it, this is all your fault.
Yeah, don't push it though.
I've got to say; I know I divorce a lot of women, never thought I would be divorcing you.
I know. I always thought if you and I got married, it would be the one that stuck. And it wouldn't be a secret, and we wouldn't have our wedding dinner at Pizza Hut.
Did I, did I even treat?
No, it was on the house, it was, it was a newlywed special.
That may be the most depressing thing I've heard in my life. I should probably get these to my lawyer's office.
Hey, thanks Ross, for taking care of all of this.
Eh, no problem.
I'm gonna need a copy of those.
Totally.
Hey! Hey! Be careful around my Porsche!
Hi Joey.
Hey! How you doin'?
He has the most amazing Porsche under there!
I'd love to show ya, but I just tucked her in. She's sleeping. Hey uh, would you two girls like to go for a drink?
Okay! Listen, I'm gonna be moving out so you will be in charge of paying the rent.
Right! And when is that due?
First of the month.
And that's every month?
No, just the months you actually want to live here.
Ahhh.
Okay, here is the phone bill.
Oh my God!!
That's our phone number. Now look, I know I kinda sprung this whole me moving out on thing, so why don't I just-why don't I just cover you for a while?
No-no! No way! Joey Tribbiani does not take charity...anymore.
It's not charity, Joe...
No! Forget it! Okay-I mean thanks, but I'm done taking money from you. All right, I can take of myself. Now, what's next? Come on.
Okay uh, here's the electric bill.
This is how much we pay for electric?!!!
Uh, yeah.
So, we'll do the rest of the bills later then?
So is Joey going to have to give up the apartment?
No, I hope not! I tried to offer him some money, but he wouldn't take it.
Well, how much do you think he needs?
I figure that $1,500 would cover him for a few months, y'know? But I have to trick him into taking it so I won't hurt his pride.
Why don't you hire him as an actor? You could have him dress up and put on little skits. Whatever you want.
Well that would help the pride thing.
Hey!
Hey! Wow! You look great! Wanna move in with me tomorrow?
Okay.
Okay! So, what do you girls have planned for tonight?
Well, instead of being sad that tonight is my last night together with Rachel we thought we'd go out to dinner and celebrate the fact that Rachel is moving in with Phoebe.
And also, my birthday.
It's not your birthday.
What a mean thing to say! I would never tell you it's not your birthday!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey! So you guys have anything planned for the big last night?
Well, instead of just hanging out, we figure we'd do nothing.
Whoa-whoa-whoa, Knicks season opener tonight. I thought maybe you guys would come over and watch it.
I don't know Ross, not if you're gonna talk about how you gave up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist.
I did give up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist!
Pheebs, I was wondering...
You're not dressed yet?! We're supposed to start having fun in 15 minutes!
Well and clearly not a minute sooner.
Rachel, you are packed though right, I mean please tell me that you're packed.
Of course I packed! Monica relax! I just wanted to ask Phoebe her opinion on what I should wear tonight.
My God, I can't get a minute of peace around this place.
Oh my God! Monica's just gonna kill you.
Yeah, yeah, I know.
Well, what you're wearing is fine for that.
Rachel, I need to borrow-You're not packed!!!! You're not packed even a little bit!
Surprise!!
What?
No, no don't get mad because look-this is what happened. So I-I started packing, then I realized, "What am I doing? I am lousy at packing!" Right? But you love packing! So, as a gift to you, on our last night, ta-da!
I'll be coordinator! Oh my God! I'm so sorry, I didn't get you anything! Okay, look everybody has to help! Okay? You can help, can't you Phoebe?
I have plans.
You're plans were with us.
That's right.
All right, Chandler can make boxes, Ross can wrap, and Joey can lift things. Now Phoebe, go tell the guys they have to help out!
Okay.
Okay! Oh my God, thank you!!
Hurry! Monica's gonna make you pack! She's got jobs for everyone! Now, it's too late for me, but save your selves!
Okay! The movers will be here in 11 hours. Rachel has not packed. Now, everybody has to help! Chandler, we're gonna start with...
Oh nope, I-I have plans with Joey.
I thought you said you were going to do nothing.
Yes, but for the last time.
Okay fine, now Ross...
Oh, but-but I can't do it.
Why not?
I've got Ben.
Because, because I've got Ben.
It's almost 8 o'clock, it's almost past his bedtime. Where-where is he?
He's at a dinner party.
Is he really coming? Because I can see right into your apartment!
Of course he is! What, do you think I'd just use my son as-as an excuse? What kind of father do you think I am?
All right, sorry.
I gotta go make a fake Ben.
Here it is! Our last pizzas together as roommates.
Oh, I wish I'd know you were going to do that, I ordered Chinese.
Oh that's okay. Hey, actually in a way it's kinda nice. Me, bringing the food of my ancestors, you, the food of yours!
Say, Joe, I had a strange idea of what we could do for our last night. What do you say we play a little uh, foosball for money?
What, are you crazy? You haven't beaten me once since my injury plagued '97 season. It would be easier if you just give me your money.
Yes it would. What do you say to $50?
Okay, you're on.
Okay, let's play! The big game, Italy vs. China, apparently.
Ohhhhhh, look it's the roller blades.
Oh God!
You remember when we got these?
No.
I guess you weren't there.
You guys, we said we were gonna have fun! Come on, hey, remember the time... You don't remember?
I'm sorry Pheebs, I guess I'm just really said that I'm leaving.
I'm gonna miss you so much.
Well, this doesn't have to be so sad though. Y'know? Maybe instead of just thinking about how much you're gonna miss each other, you should like think of the things you're not gonna miss.
I don't think there's anything.
Come on, there's gotta be something.
Nope, she's perfect.
I have one.
Good! Great! You can go first.
Uh well, I guess I'm not gonna miss the fact that you're never allowed to move the phone pen.
Good that's a good one. Okay, Monica, anything? Y'know? Does Rachel move the phone pen?
Aw, sometimes. Always, actually.
Okay, good. There you go. Doesn't anyone feel better?
Not just the phone pen. I never get my messages.
You get your messages!
Yeah, well I don't think it really counts if you have to read them off the back of your hand after you fall asleep on the couch.
So-so, you missed a message from who? Chandler or your mom? Or Chandler? Or your mom?
Great! It worked! No one's sad.
Yes! I win again! Ha-ha! That's like 500 bucks you owe me! Whoo-ho-hoo! $500 that is a loooot of electricity! Whoo-ho-ho! I gotta buy some food.
Okay, give me a chance to win my money back. Okay? Sudden death, one goal, $1,000.
You serious?
Oh yes!
Okay, get ready to owe me!
Okay.
Okay, here we go. Ready?
No! No! No! No--one can beat me.
See? Now, that's why only the little fake men are supposed to do all the kicking.
Hello? Oh, hi Ross! See? Other people call me!
Ooh, your brother. Score!
What's up?
Oh, I'm just over here with Ben. I thought we'd say hi.
Oh, put him on!
Ben, say hi to Aunt Monica. Oh, I guess he doesn't feel like talking right now. He's smiling though! Okay, talk to you later.
Yeah, I think it was better when you guys were sad. Hey, uh, remember the roller blades?
You know what else I'm not gonna miss? "I'm Monica. I wash the toilet 17 times a day. Even if people are on it!"
"Hi I'm Rachel, is my sweater too tight? No? Oh, I'd better wash it and shrink it!"
"I'm Monica, I don't get phone messages from interesting people. Ever!"
Hey! I call her!
"Oh my God, I love Ross! I hate Ross! I love Ross! I hate Ross!"
"Oh my God, I can't find a boyfriend! So I guess I'll just stumble across the hall and sleep with the first guy I find in there!"
Yeah, we should get a move on if we wanna make those dinner reservations.
Still broken?
This sucks man! The last night you're here and I lose the two most important things in my life, the foosball table and $500.
Well, there are other ways of winning back your money, how about a little uh, a little Blackjack?
Nah, not my game.
Okay, uh, how about, how about-y'know what? We could play a new game. A new game, it's fun.
Well, what's it called?
Cups.
I don't know how to play Cups.
I'll teach ya! Come on, come on, it's really easy and really, really fun.
All right.
Okay, here you go. I have two queens, what do you have?
A two and a five.
Ho-ho, you win! 50 dollars!
Really?!
Oh yeah! Okay, let's play again. What do you got?
A four and a nine.
You're kidding right?
No. Why?
Well that's a full cup!
Damn! I am good at Cups!
I'm not talking to her!
Well, one of you has to take the first step! And it should be you, because she's the one who's leaving. It's harder for her!
Well, maybe you're right-She made fun of my phone pen!
I know, I took it hard too.
Listen Rachel, I feel really bad about-What are you doing?
I'm unpacking!
What?!
I'm not moving! Is that picture straight?
It needs to go about 20 blocks to the left!
Hey, y'know what? You're the one who wants to make this big change and move in with Chandler! You should be the one to go! Why should I have to leave?!
Because it's my apartment!
Well it's mine too! What else you got?!
How about, you're moving!!
Look! This is ridiculous. We should be packing you!!
Hey, how are you guys doing?
Great! Monica's moving!
I am not!
Oh really?! Then how come all your stuff is in this box?!
Okay, you guys. You guys I think I know what's going on here. Okay, you guys... STOP!! I know that, I know that you're acting mad because you think that it'll make it easier to leave. But deep down you're still really sad. Deep-deep down.
No Phoebe I am mad!
Well, deep-deep-deep down!
Yeah, I'm just mad!
Then keep running.
You win.
Well, what did you have?
It doesn't matter because nothing beats a three and a six. That my friend is D-Cup. Okay, now much have you won so far?
Uh, wow, 700.
Not 700 exactly?
Yeah.
Double it!
What?
Well you see in Cups, once you get $700, you have to double it.
Really?
Hey, I didn't make up the rules. Now, after you receive the doubling bonus, you get uh, one card. Now that one card could be worth $100 bringing your total to 1,500. Don't get to excited because that's not gonna happen unless you get-No way!
Well, this is the last box of your clothes. I'm just gonna label it, "What were you thinking?"
Funny, because I was just gonna go across the hall and write that on Chandler.
Hey you guys, I don't mean to make things worse, but umm, I don't want to live with Rachel anymore.
What?!
You're just so mean to each other! And I don't want to end up like that with Rachel. I still like you!
Well, Phoebe that's fine because I'm not moving.
Whoa-whoa-whoa, Phoebe you gotta take her! Y'know I-I-I said some really bad stuff about her, but y'know Rachel has some good qualities that make her a good roommate.
Oh really? Like what Monica?
Y'know she has 147,000 pairs of boots...
Oh yeah, good start Mon.
She lets you borrow them.
Yeah and you stretch 'em out with your big old clown feet.
Do you wanna live outside?! Because it's gettin' cold! She gets tons of catalogs and umm, she'll fold down the pages of the things she thinks that I'd like.
What else?
When I take a shower, she leaves me little notes on the mirror.
Yeah, I do. I-I do, do that.
That's nice. I like having things to read in the bathroom.
When I fall asleep on the couch after reading, she covers me over with a blanket.
Well y'know, I don't want you to be cold.
And when I told her that I was gonna be moving in with Chandler, she was really supportive. You were so great. You made it so easy. And now you have to leave. And I have to live with a boy!!
Oh, it's gonna be fine.
Okay Rachel, I can't wait to live with you! And you know what we should do? Bring Monica and then we could all live there together! We'll have so much fun!!
But honey, I think she's moving in with Chandler.
Oh that's right. You're still set on that?
Kinda. Oh my God!
Hello? Hey Mon, how's the packing going? Ben? He's fine. Yeah, he's right-Oh my God! Get your head of your shirt there son! What? Yeah, it's a pumpkin. I'll come pack.
Hey!
What's wrong?
Ross and I were helping the girls pack, took a little break, I lost $1,500 to him in Cups!
Wh-How did you lose at Cups?!
The same way you lost. I started out with a King and a Queen, bamn! Ross gets a 2 and a 3. Then I get a Jack and a King, boom! Ross gets a 4 and a 5! Ross was getting the Cup card, the D-Cup, the Sittin' Down Bonus! Meanwhile, I didn't even get half a cup! Nothin'!!
Oh man!!
And he never played before either! Y'know what I think? I think beginner's luck, very important in Cups.
All right, let's play one more hand! One more!
No, no, no more! I cannot lose another dime! I'm serious this time! In-in fact, look, there's a-I wanna give you something. And let me give it too you know before I pawn it for Cups money. Now, I want you to have the big white dog as a kinda of a, y'know, thank you for being such a great roommate.
I can't take the big white dog! You love it!
It's him, not it!
No, but wait-what if I bought it from you, y'know? And your nice gesture would be giving it to me at a reasonable price, say $1,500?
Wait a second, I see what you're trying to do here! You-you're trying to give me money again!
When did I try to give you money?
Over there! Before, with the bills! You tried to give some charity, I said "No," you dropped it. Okay? Then we had a nice last night together, we had some fun, we gambled, nobody tried to give anybody any money! Now out of the blue, you start with the charity thing again!
I'm just trying to help you out! Okay? I wanna make sure that you're okay.
I will be okay! Look Chandler, you gotta get it out of your head that I can't take care of myself. Okay? Look, I'm not gonna miss you helping me out with money. The only thing that I'm gonna miss...is you. And now the dog.
Hey. Call me when you get there. Okay?
Okay.
I'm really gonna miss you.
Oh! I have your key. Here you go.
Thanks.
Yeah.
Oh God! This is silly, I'm gonna see you in a couple of hours!
Yeah.
Bye house!
Bye Mon.
Bye.
Hey.
She really left.
I know.
Thank you.
No problem roomie.
Can I ask you a question?
Sure!
What the hell is that dog doing here?!
I invented the game of Cups as a way to give Joey money.
And now you want that money back.
Exactly.
Chandler, what kind of an idiot do you take me for?
It's not a real game! I made it up!
I'm sorry you lost your money, but I won it fair and square.
At a fake game!!
Now, if you wanna try to make some of it back, I'd be glad to play you for it. But I should warn you, I am very good at Cups.
Okay! Now I assume the Saucer card came up when you played last.
No.
Hmm, let's see if it comes up this time.
Ready?
Yeah.
Okay.
Hi...
it's...
Rachel...
and...
Phoebe's...
please...
leave...
leave...
Wait, I-I just said "leave."
Yeah, I know because you have all the good words. What do I get? I get "it's," "and" oh I'm sorry, I have "A." Forget it.
Phoebe, come on that's silly.
All right, so let's switch.
No, I have all of the good words. OK, fine, fine, we can switch.
Okay.
Okay.
Hi...
Everybody...
It's...
Rachel...
and...
Phoebe's...
Please...wait, how did you do that?
What?
Oh, you're no ordinary roommate are you?
Phoebe, come on can we finish this later? Cause I wanna go running before it gets dark. Oh! Why don't you come with me?!
Really?
Yeah, it'll be fun. We'll run in the park. It'll be like our first y'know roommate bonding thing.
Okay, let's go running!
Yeah and there's really cute guys there.
Let's run towards them!
OK!
All right, wait just one more second. Hi, it's Phoebe and Rachel's. Please leave a message, thanks!
Now wait a minute. You just took all the words!
Uh-huh. You've met your match Rachel Green.
So, I just finished this fascinating book. By the year 2030, there'll be computers that can carry out the same amount of functions as an actual human brain. So theoretically you could download your thoughts and memories into this computer and-and-and live forever as a machine.
And I just realized I can sleep with my eyes open.
Hey!
Hey!
Honey, that's a great idea nailing the boxes to the floor!
I didn't nail the boxes to the floor.
Oh, So you can move them!
Yes, and while I'm doing that, Ross has a great computer story for you.
Hey everybody! Uh, I'd like you to meet Janine. She's-she's gonna be my new roommate!
Hi.
Hi!
Hi
Yeah, she's gonna live with me!
It's nice to meet you. Janine...?
Lecroix. Janine Lecroix
I didn't know that! Well, what a pretty last name!
So, uh, wh-where ya from?
Australia, I just moved here a couple of weeks ago.
From the land down under? I didn't know that either!
So uh, wha-uh, what do you do?
I'm a dancer.
You're a dancer? She-she's a dancer!
Well, I think I'll go and unpack.
Oh, hey let me.
Joey, did you even interview this woman before you asked her to move in?
Of course I did.
Uh-huh, what exactly did you ask her?
"When can you move in?"
Thank you for bringing her into our lives.
Unbelievable
Oh, so you like her too Chandler?
Hey, look at all the boxes!
Ugh, I cannot wait to ask her out!
Wait a minute...Joey. Joey you can't ask her out, she's your roommate. It-it'll be way too complicated.
Yeah, yeah man don't do it. I mean if you date her, then-then-then I can't date her.
All right, think about it. Now remember when you were going out with that girl Donna and you guys broke up. Remember how horrible it was when you guys bumped into each other at the supermarket?
Oh God, yeah.
Now imagine you live at the supermarket.
Okay!
No-no
Oh, Oh, you're right! I don't want that. I can't date her!
Yeah and you better watch the flirting too, cause you know, in such close quarters, it could be trouble.
Well, that's gonna be tough Mon. I mean it's hard for me to be around an attractive woman and not flirt.
Hmm, well you're around me all the time and you don't flirt.
You a little sad about that sweetheart?
I have to tie my shoe, so you go ahead, I'll catch up.
Okay.
Okay. Come on! That's not running! Let's go!
You guys, I'm telling you, when she runs, she looks like a cross between Kermit The Frog and The Six Million Dollar Man.
Monica had such a crush on him. Yeah, she used to kiss his poster every night before she went to bed.
Oh! I used to do that too!
Did you also have his album, It's Not Easy Being Green?
Aw, Mon...
So, Phoebe runs weird huh?
Yeah, yeah and you know what, I know she's gonna wanna run again, I just don't know how to get out of it, I mean, I live with her.
Why don't you just be straight with her? Tell her the truth.
Yeah.
You're right, you're right. I should just tell her the truth.
Hey!
Hey!
Pheebs, Monica tripped me, I don't think I can ever run again, ever!
Why? Why would you do that?
I don't know. Rachel I'm-I'm sorry that I hurt your ankles.
Ankle.
We'll see.
OK, I'm officially unpacked. Thanks for helping me man. Joe? Well, I guess Joey went home. Oh and look, there's still one box that I have to unpack.
I Gotcha!!
Oh my God! You-almost-gave-me-a-heart-attack.
Boy, it was so hard not to laugh, I tell ya. Hey, hey, the place looks great!
Yeah, not bad right? You know what, Monica's gonna be working late, so I'm gonna make this place spotless. You know what else I'm gonna do, know what else I'm gonna do? I'm gonna go downstairs, I'm gonna get her some flowers. Now who wouldn't wanna live with me?
I don't! No, I wanna live with the super-hot Australian dancer.
Yeah, now how's that going though? Are you okay with the not-flirting thing?
Yeah. Well, so far yeah. But it's tough you know? I got all this built up flirting energy and I don't know how to get rid of it. How you doin?
Ohhhh man
Sorry, there's just more room out here.
No-no-no-no-no, it's-it's uh, you just uh, uh reminded me that uh, I need to do my stretches too.
Why don't you try to do-
What's wrong?
Uh-uh nothing. I-I-I-I didn't want you to touch me cause I'm -I'm all sweaty from the workout. I better hit the shower. Oh my God!
Oh, sorry about that stuff hanging in there. It's just my thongs are too delicate for the dryer.
Hi! Oh yeah, uh-huh, it's me. I saw you grab your running shoes this morning and sneak out. You lied so you could run by yourself.
No, no Phoebe no, I was...no. You know what, I was, I was actually just checking to, see, if I could run. And I can!
Please Rachel, I am not an idiot.
No, wait Phoebe.
Wow, couples who live together do start to look alike. So, Mondler...uh, what uh, what 'cha doin?
What does it look like I'm doing? I am cleaning!
Did you get Monica's authorization to move all of her stuff?
Authorization? I don't need that. I'm gonna put everything back.
Put it back exactly where you found it?
Yes I'm gonna put it back exactly where I found it.
'Kay, first of all, this attitude is not helping.
She's not gonna care if I put her stuff back in the same stupid place.
Whoa, hello, did you just meet Monica?
She is gonna recognize that I did a nice thing and-and, appreciate it.
Hmm -you know, actually this'll work out well. Cause when you have to move back in with Joey, Joey's hot new roommate can come and live with me.
I see, I see, y-y-you're trying to freak me out.
Look Chandler, Monica is really weird about this kind stuff all right. Believe me, I lived with her for 16 years. She is going to freak...out. Oh my God, she's going to sit on you.
No, she's not okay? And I'll prove it to you. I'm gonna call her right now. Phone's done ehh.
Hi!
Hey Mon, how's it going?
Terrible. If-if I want something done right, I have to do it myself. Other people just wreck stuff. I really think I might kill someone tonight.
Oh come on, come on, it can't be that bad.
It's worse. The only thing that's getting me through is knowing that I'm gonna be seeing you soon. I think I may even try to get out of here early.
No! No-no-no-no-no-no. It sounds like they really need you down there.
Well, are you just hanging out with Ross?
It's, all good! Okay bye-bye Mon! She's-she's gonna kill me.
Yeah, the phone was facing the other way. And that goes back up there.
We should start with the big stuff. Y'know? That'll be the easiest. Uh, let's start with the couch. I got it.
Yeah that-that, doesn't look right.
What are you talking about? The couch is perfectly in line with the carpet. And then I can just walk over here and casually just put my feet right up on the... OK, OK, here's what we do, we just uh, move the couch closer to the coffee table.
Whoa, whoa, but then the back of the couch won't line up with he back of the carpet.
OK well here, we'll just move the coffee table closer to the couch.
Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, but then the coffee table won't be centered in the seating area.
Yes, but the coffee table doesn't match the...blahebdmsdlkhdyslkd;btyds...Rooosss!!!!
Look, what am I gonna do? I'm not flirting but still, I'm drawing her to me like - like a moth to a flame! What the hell's going on over here?!?!? Monica's gonna kill you! Look I need your help, I have to do something to-to repel this woman! Wait a minute, wait a minute, you guys repel women all the time.
Hey, I've been married 3 times
No-no-no I've seen it happen, you-you get a rapport going with a woman but somehow you manage to kill it. What's your secret?
Look, we do not repel women OK? That is completely untrue.
Oh no, yes we do my man. Remember when we were back in college and we went to that spring dance and you walked right up to that girl you liked and you could not stop talking about the Irish potato famine?
Yeah, well what about you? You weren't you know, so hot in college either. After everything he said, he'd go "ba dum bum chessh"
Yeah, Monica doesn't like that either, Maybe I should stop doing that.
Oh y'know what, girls don't like it when I start talking about science.
That's not specific to girls.
This is great, this is great, what else, what else?
Uh, they don't like it when you correct their grammar.
And they don't like it when you explain why your jokes are funny.
They don't like it when you keep asking them if they like you.
Man, I'm so lucky I have Monica.
I'm never gonna find love again.
Hey Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?
Sure
Okay, um, I... All right Phoebe look, I just wanted to say that I'm sorry. OK? I handled the situation horribly and I should not have lied to you.
So, what should you have done?
Well, I-I should've told you the truth.
Uh-Huh, Which is...?
Well, y'know, the reason I didn't wanna go running with you is because um, well y'know the way that you run is a little...
So?
Well, it's embarrassing. People were looking at us like we were crazy.
Why do you care?
Because they're people.
But people that you don't know and will never see again.
Yes, but still. They're people...with eyes.
Well, I didn't get embarrassed running next to Miss . But no, okay. No, no, I can see why running with me would be embarrassing to you. Yeah, okay. You're uptight.
I-I am not uptight-Hey-hey-hey-oh-oh! Listen, I am not uptight, man.
That's okay Rachel. I'm not judging you; that's just who you are. Me. I'm more free y'know? I run like I did when I was a kid, cause that's the only way it's fun. Y'know, I mean didn't you ever run so fast you thought your legs were gonna fall off? Y'know, like when you were like running towards the swings or running away from Satan? The neighbor's dog.
Okay, is this lamp in the same place?
Who cares? I repel women.
No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no!!! You can't come in here! R-r-r-r-Ross is naked.
What?!
What?!
I couldn't say that I was naked because she's allowed too see me naked.
Why does anyone have to be naked?
Why is Ross naked?
I-I had to show Chandler something?
Naked?
Yeah-yeah I uh, I have a uh, a guy problem.
Is it the same thing that Chandler had?
Look, uh, just come later, we'll get everything squared away and you can come back later.
Okay, listen, there's still some of Chandler's medicine under the sink in the bathroom. Bye!
Bye! Thank God
Dude, what'd you have?
Look, we have no time okay? We must focus. We gotta get everything back into its original place.
The photo album! There were millions of pictures of the apartment in the photo album. We just go through it and match everything to the pictures.
That's perfect! That's brilliant!
So really, what'd ya have?
Hey Joey, I got some beer for you.
Uh, don't you mean "for whom?"
Sure, listen I was gonna order some pizza, you wanna share one?
Pizza, heh, its not like I never had that before...ba dum bum cheshhh.
Is there something wrong?
All right, All right, let's just get this out in the open okay? You're hot. I'm lovable. Clearly there's a vibe going on between us. But, we're roommates and it's a huge mistake for us to continue down this road.
Joey...
No, no, no, I'm telling ya. Imagine yourself living in a supermarket and you will understand okay? So the question is, what do we do?
Well, I don't think there is anything to do. I mean I think you're really sweet, but I'm just not interested in you like that.
Oh!
No! I mean you're a really nice guy and I'm happy to be your roommate and your friend, I'm just y'know, I just don't feel that way about you.
Oh! I see what happened. It's because I was trying to repel you. Right? Believe me, you'd feel a lot different if I turned it on.
I don't think so.
Oh, I do. How you doin?
I'm OK
What?!?!
What?
Oh dear God!
Hey!
Hey!
Oh honey, I'm so sorry, you were right, this feels great!
See? And you don't care if people are staring, it's just for a second cause then you're gone!
Gone! I mean its amazing Pheebs. I feel so free and so graceful. Hey! Look out for the horse! Sorry!
Is it okay for me to come in now?
Uh-huh
Why is everything different?
Bye!
No, I don't see anything different other than the fact that the room got so much brighter when you came into it.
Well, the end table is wrong, The couch looks bizarre and don't even get me started on the refrigerator magnets.
Okay look, don't...don't be mad okay? But after I unpacked the boxes I wanted to do something nice for you, so, I-I-I cleaned the apartment. So I moved everything around and then I forgot where it, where it went back and I'm sorry, I'm very sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
It's okay. Chandler, are you afraid of me or something?
Do you want me to be afraid of you?
Of course not. I mean gosh, Chandler what you did, it's, it's a wonderful thing and I really appreciate it. I know I have this weird thing where I want everything to be in the perfect place, but I'd never expect you to worry about that.
Really?
Of course!
Oh well you're the best. You come here to me.
All right, hold on okay? First thing's first. Okay, now did Ross sit anywhere while he was naked?
So it said that by the year 2030, there'll be computers that can carry out the same number of functions as an actual human brain. So theoretically we could download our thoughts and our memories into this computer...
...and live forever as a machine!
That's so Janine, you-you-you know what, do you know we're doing right now? You and I, we're interfacing.
Yeah, I gotta go.
Ba dum bumb cheshhh!
Hey.
Hi, my name's Chandler. I just moved in next door and I was wondering if you would be interested in battling me in a post-apoplectic world for control of the galaxies last remaining energy source?
Sure, neighbor come on in.
So, is Janine around?
Uh, no, she's at dance class.
Can I check out what she did to my room?
Yeah, but, hey look, don't go through her stuff. She gets really mad.
Oh my God. What is th... it's like a guy never lived in here. Look, you've got to be careful. This girl thing is dangerous. It's spreading already.
It is???
Yeah, is this your pretty pink pillow on the couch?
No.
Is that your tiny little box, that's too small to put anything in?
No.
No! Ok, this is not good. You are a guy. Ok? This is a guys place. If you let this go, you're going to be sitting around with your fingers soaking in stuff.
All right, you're right. I'll talk to her.
Yes talk to her. Be a man.
I'm a man.
Defend yourself.
Hmm.
Chandler come on. We have to hem the new dust ruffle.
Be right there sweetums. A totally different situation.
Hey guys.
Hey, how was your breakfast with Hillary?
It was okay. She's still kind of depressed because she broke up with her boyfriend.
Ohh, yeah.
Well, is this Hillary your HOT assistant chef Hillary?
Yeah.
The one that always stares at me when I come in?
No, the one who looked at you once because you got in her way.
Still I could tell. She was into me. Well, why don't you set us up?
Ohh, are you setting Ross up with someone? Does she have a wedding dress?
Hey.
Hey.
Rachel?
Yeah.
I'm, uhh, making up flyers trying to get new massage clients. So, can I come to Bloomingdale's and use the copy machine.
Well, sure, but they might think it's kinda weird considering I don't work there anymore.
Oh my God. What happened?
I-I, got a job at Ralph Lauren.
Well that's great! Congratulations!!
Yeah. A year ago..
You've lasted a whole year. Good for you.
But, Pheebs, you can still use the copy machine where I actually work. But, just come by at lunch so my boss doesn't see you. Cause Kim will just freak out and she already doesn't like me very much.
That's weird. I don't think my boss likes me either.
I don't think mine likes me either.
Maybe it's a universal thing?
Or maybe, it's because you're hanging around here at 11:30 on a Wednesday.
Yeah let's head off to work.
We should go.
Thank you.
Sure.
Now you will not believe this. But, I was in the copy room, making copies, and Ralph Lauren came in.
Oh my God. Did you talk to him?
Yeah a little. He seems really nice. Good kisser.
What? What!?! You kissed him?
Totally.
Phoebe are you serious?
Yeah. I was just in there. He introduced himself and the next thing I know, we're making out. You know.
Phoebe, I mean, you do know he's married?
No!
Phoebe...
What am I supposed to do? Ask every guy I make out with if he's married? No, yeah, I should.
Hey Joey.
Hey. Uh, can I talk to you for a second? This, uh, kid in this picture. Do you, uh, know this kid? Is that like a relative or something?
No, I just thought it was cute.
Yeah, that's what I was afraid of.. Okay, uhh...Look Janine I really want you to feel at home here, but some of this new stuff. It's...too girly.
Ohh. Like what?
Like this. Pictures of cute babies we don't know. We..we can't have that.
Joey, it's Anne Geddes. She's a famous artist.
Look I don't know this baby. I don't know if she's a famous artist or not. You know, and I don't want to be a jerk but you're changing too much around here.
Well, I'm sorry. I just thought I'd try to make the place a little nicer.
Yeah but it's too much stuff. You know like, you got the candles and the foofy schmoofer thing here and over here you got a picture of a watering can.
Well I just thought...
I'm sure it's a famous watering can, okay. But, come on...and what is with the really hot stick in the bathroom?
It's a curling iron.
Ohh, well, that's ok then. But, okay my towels for instance. I come in to the bathroom here and my towel is not on the floor where keep it. It's up here on some hook..and...smells different.
It's clean.
Yeah, well, it feels different.
It's dry.
Alright, I can make my peace with the clean dry towels...Also what is with these chips you bought?
No no no no, it's potpourri. You're supposed to smell it.
Well that's like summer in a bowl.
Oh, Kim, Hi.
Uhh-huh.
So you know, I...I handed in that marketing report and I never got to hear what you thought.
I didn't read it.
Ahh....So...Wow...The spring line, it's really going to be great this year, huh?
Yeah.
So I hear the Ralph Lauren fooled around with someone in the copy room.
Tell me everything.
Hey guys.
Hey.
What's up?
You know...Oh My God.
What happened to your teeth.
I whitened them.
Really.
Yeah. What do you think.
Well, I think I shouldn't look directly at them.
Come on, seriously.
Ross they're really, really, really white.
Yeah, what was wrong with your old...human teeth.
Ahh, I-I did leave the gel on a little longer then it said to.
How much longer?
A-A day.
Ross you know that tonight is your date with Hillary?
I know. That's why I did it. Come on, are they really that bad?
No, no no no. You'll be fine. Hillary's bind, right?
She will be after tonight.
Yeah.
Oh, hey, hey Rach, do you notice anything..ahh...
Yeah. Your teeth? Yes, I saw them from outside. You guys are never going to believe this. But, Phoebe made out with Ralph Lauren.
What???
Oh my god.
Yeah I know. She ran into him at my office and they just...made out. And the craziest thing is, now my boss likes me because I told her about it and she said it was the best gossip she'd heard all year.
I am proud of all my friends today.
My God, Rachel, I can't believe Phoebe made out with Ralph Lauren. Ohh, I'm so jealous.
Hi, I'm Chandler. Your live-in boy
Chandler, please, come on. Look at him.
Oh, I am no women, but that is one tasty dish.
Hey. Here. Ohh, who's the silver fox?
That-that is your make out buddy. Don't you recognize him? Oh wait. Ohh, Phoebe I love you. Kiss me please.
That's not Ralph Lauren. Sounds like him though.
What?
Yeah, no, Ralph doesn't look anything like that guy. He's-he's young and he's got long hair and a beard and a hacky sack.
Oh My God, Phoebe, that's not Ralph Lauren. That's Kenny the copy guy.
What?
Oh..Go..Oh..and I told my boss that someone made out with Ralph Lauren. If she finds out that I lied to her, she is going to hate me even more. Phoebe!!
Why would the copy guy say he was Ralph Lauren?
To get you to make out with him!!!
Ohhh.
Okay, maybe this will make your teeth look less white. Nope. Okay, colors that don't work are blue, yellow, green, red, black, white, orange, and purple.
I don't know what I'm going to do. That date starts in like an hour.
Hey Ross, maybe if your skin was lighter. Your teeth wouldn't look so bright.
Oh great. So all I need to do is get some new skin. Thank you.
I'm just saying, if we put just a little bit of makeup on you.
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. We're not 13 anymore.
Ross this is the only thing left that has a shot at working.
But, won't she notice I have makeup on?
Please. Half the guys out there have makeup on.
What??
All right, half the people. I mean, just try it and see.
No. I am not putting on makeup.
Hello. Oh good. Ross could you put up some of these flyers for me? OH!! Demon!! Demon!!
Now are drawers will smell nice and we didn't waste these pantyhose.
Yes, God forbid we throw out old underwear. You-you know what? I'm going to go over to Joey's.
Wait, we're supposed to organize the wrapping paper drawer.
Yes, but I feel like I've really gotten in touch with my feminine side enough today. You know. In fact I think we're two sachets away from becoming a lesbian couple.
You know what? This has been kind of a girlie day. You're right, I'm sorry.
Nah, Nah, it's okay. I feel like I need to be in guy place. You know, do kind of like a man thing.
Yeah. Go over to Joey's. Go over to Joey's and drink some beer and hammer up some drywall.
You know when guys hang out they don't just drink some beer and hammer up drywall?
When girls hang out, we don't have pillow fights in our underwear. I'm sorry. We do. We do. I don't know why I said that.
Hey Chandler. Come on in. We're knitting pot holders.
No thanks, Josephine.
Hey Ross, I was wondering if... Oh my God!! Where are all the men???
Ohh, hi, Kim.
Hi Rachel.
Yeah, remember that thing I told you that happened yesterday? Well it didn't happen.
You didn't cancel the fabric order from Taiwan?
Okay, two things didn't happen. Remember I told you that someone made out with Ralph Lauren in the copy room? Well, it turns out that's not true.
That's not true?
No.
Oh that's interesting? Because I checked and only one keycard was used to access the copy machine yesterday during lunch and that keycard belonged to you, Rachel.
Oh no, no, no. Oh God, you think I made out with him.
Listen to me. If you think sleeping with Ralph is going to get you my job. You are sadly mistaken.
I-I don't want your job. I-I don't. Ohh this is such a mistake. I did not make out with him. Nobody made out with him. I did not use my keycard yesterday. I don't even know how to use my keycard.
Hi Ralph.
Hi Kim.
Yeah, nothing happen. You could cut the sexual tension in here with a knife.
And after that, what could I do except become a chef.
Mmm-Hmm.
And someday soon, I hope to open my own restaurant.
Mmm.
You know, you're a really great listener. Most guys I go out with, they just talk and talk.
Mm-Hmm.
After a while it's like, shut your mouth, you know?
Hmm-Hmm.
I've probably been talking too much. Why don't we talk about you a little bit?
Mmm-Unmm.
Come on. I want to know.
Hmm-Hmm-Hmm. Okay. I, uh, am from Long Island. I-I came to the city for college. Um, I, um, have a 5 year old son and in my spare time I like to read spy novels. But, but, let's talk more about you. Hmm.
So what's really neat. If you sear the stems of the flowers first in a frying pan, your arrangement will look fresh much longer.
Oh my God, Joey, that is such a great tip.
Monica, could you excuse us for a second? I need to talk to the girl with the flowers.
Okay. Oh but Joey, come over later because I'm going to teach you to make a bird feeder out of just a pine cone and some peanut butter.
Ohh, I love birds.
What is the matter with you ?!?
What?
You're arranging flowers! You got dead flowers! You got a picture, a picture, of a baby dressed like flowers! This is not Joey!!
Hey. Hey look I am still Joey, okay. Flowers they're just, you know, they're nice to look at. And that happens to be a picture by a famous artist. Of a famous baby.
You're turning into a women.
No I'm not. Why would you say that? That's just mean.
Now I've upset you? What did I say?
It's not what you said. It's the way you said it....Oh My God, I'm a woman!!!
Now, she thinks that I made out with him and I did it to get her job.
But why didn't you just tell her the truth.
I did but she doesn't think anyone would be stupid enough to confuse Kenny the copy guy with Ralph Lauren.
Well, hey, what if Kenny were the real brains behind the whole company? You know. What if Kenny hired that Ralph Lauren guy to be the pretty front man? Huh, did she ever think of that?
You were with Kenny today, weren't you?
Just for a second.
Ohh, Phoebe, what am I going to do?
Well, the only thing you can do. Sleep with Ralph Lauren.
I'm not going to sleep with Ralph Lauren. I mean, I could, but I wouldn't.
Ohh, sleep with Kenny.
That wouldn't help me.
Ohh, yes it would.
I've had a really good time tonight.
Mmm.
You know, I rarely connect with someone this much on the first date.
Hmm-Hmm-Hmm. Me, neither. I've had a really good time too, you know.
Are you going to eat that bread?
Ohh, I just like the smell. Mmmm.
You make me laugh.
Hmm-Hmm.
Would you like to move over to the couch?
Mmm-Hmm.
Maybe I'll just turn the lights down a little.
How about all the way.
Okay.
Wow, cool poster. Or should I say groovy poster? So, ahh, where were we?
Are those your teeth??
Ohh, you can see them, huh?
Yes. They're insanely white.
I-I, did that for you.
What's a matter with you?
What's a matter with me? You've got a black light. It's 1999!
Kim, hi.
Hi Rachel. Ohh, I've been meaning to ask you. Have you seen the new Ralph Lauren sheets? Ohh, what am I thinking. Of course you have.
Okay..Okay.. Look. I'm sorry that I lied to you before. You were right. Ralph and I were an item but were not anymore.
Oh, really?
Yeah, he dumped me. He said, "Rachel, I can't do this. Even though you are a very, very, very beautiful woman. I can't do this. I'm married and I'm sorry." And then I don't know why but he said, "and you will never get promoted. Especially not above Kim, who is an integral cog in the Ralph Lauren machine."
You expect me to believe.. Hi Ralph.
Hi Kim.
Oh my God. He just gave you the coldest look I have ever seen. It's like he hates you. Then it is true.
Of course it's true and it hurts so bad.
Ohh honey come here. Ohh it will be ok. We've all been there.
You and Ralph?
Kenny the copyboy.
Hey.
Hey, uhh, I need to talk to you.
What's the matter? Are you upset?
I'm sorry but we've got to get rid of all this girlie stuff in here. I, uh, I got to be a man! Okay. The living room has to remain a guy place, okay? That's just the way it has to be.
Well, if that's what you want. I'll just put it all in my room.
Great...Great...and thanks for being so understanding. I mean, I didn't want to make a big deal out of this, you know. You could, uh, put the picture of the famous baby in my room. I mean, if you want to.
Okay.
And, uhh, maybe the watering can there.
Sure.
And a couple of these little tiny boxes.
Joey? Do you want me to put it all in your room?
Okay.
Okay, great! Bye. So guess who's coming to Thanksgiving dinner?
Sydney Portier? Hehheh.
I miss Rachel. No, my parents.
Oh! That's great, they haven't seen the place since I moved in!
Yeah, and y'know, if you could not mention to them that we live together, that would be great! , I was thinking we would eat around four.
Why can't I tell them that we live together?
Because they don't know we're dating. Do you think we should eat in the kitchen?
Why haven't you told them?!
Um, well, I was going to, I-I-I really was. But um, then somewhere, just out of nowhere, I didn't.
Why haven't you told them?! Wouldn't they be happy?!
So! Dinner in the kitchen around four! I'll see you then.
Why wouldn't they be happy?
Well, um, because mainly, um, they don't like you. I'm sorry.
What? What? Why?!
Maybe because you used to be aloof, or that you're really sarcastic, or that, y'know, you joke around all the time. Or that you take off your clothes and throw them on the couch.
Is this why they don't like me or why you don't like me?
Look, I know that I should've told them. I know I shouldn't care what they think. I'm sorry.
Y'know, it'll be okay. It'll be okay. Because when they come over, I will be all charming, I will make them fall in love with me, and then we'll tell 'em.
You really think that'll work?
Hey, I can be pretty charming, babe, I won YOU over, didn't I?
I don't think you'll ever get my parents that drunk!
Hey! Oh, good, Ross! You're parents like me, right?
Yes, of course they like you!
Well Monica just told me that they don't.
Yeah, they don't like you.
Do you know why?
I dunno, maybe it's because you're really sarcastic. Or maybe it's cause you uh-
Well if people don't know they shouldn't just guess!
This is great, another Thanksgiving with nothing to give thanks for.
Maybe I could give thanks for you shuttin' up, eh?
Maybe I could give thanks by taking my Playstation over to my new apartment.
Well maybe I love ya'.
.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey guys!
No I don't want to play video games, Joey!
Are you guys going to Chandler's for Thanksgiving?
Yeah! Yeah, why? What's up?
Well, me and my dancer friends are thinking of doing Thanksgiving uptown. I thought you guys might like to come.
For real?
No, but you should go to Chandler's. Because none of us knows how to cook, we'll probably just end up drinking all day.
Ye-ye, we go to yours!
Yeah, see, we-we-we have to stop across the hall, because it's my sister. But, uh, uh y'know actually, growing up with a sister was nice because it really helped me understand women. Yeah, you-you should tell your friends that.
Okay.
How you got three women to marry you, I'll never know.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey! Hey, Pheebs, check it out. Yeah, for my desert, I have chosen to make a traditional English truffle!
Wow, that sounds great! And what are you making Monica, in case Rachel's dessert is... so good that I eat all of it. There's none left for anybody else!
Nothing.
Nothing?
No, sweetie, I-I trust you.
So, if-if I mess this up, there's nothing else for dessert?
You're not gonna mess it up.
Wow, Monica, I love that, you really have faith in me. Thank you. Technical question, how do you know when uh, the butter's done?
Well, it's done about two minutes before it looks like that.
Hey!
Hey!
Oh, ooh the food smells great, Mon!
And the place looks so nice!
Yeah, hey hey, Happy Thanksgiving everybody!
Happy Thanksgiving!
Happy Thanksgiving!
Well, this has been great!
See ya!
Whoa whoa whoa! Where're you goin'?
Oh, oh, we did say we'd stop by this little thing Joey's roommate is having.
Oh, Janine, the really hot dancer girl?
Some would say she's attractive, yes.
And who else is going to be there?
Uh, some of her friends, yeah.
Her dancer friends?
Yes, all right? All of her hot dancer friends are gonna be there and they're gonna be, be drinkin' and dancin, and we really wanna go!
Dude, we were good!
You're not gonna go anywhere, you said you were gonna eat here, and you're gonna eat here!
Yeah, and-and leaving us to go see hot dancer girls is not very Thanksgivingy.
Oh, but-but it is, uh, it's just like the first Thanksgiving, when the Indians and the Pilgrims uh, sat down to dinner.
Yeah, yeah, and the Indians taught the Pilgrims what it meant to be hot in the new world!
Hello everybody!
Hi!
Hi!
Dad , Mom . Look! Look who it is it's Chandler!
Oh yes of course, hello Chandler.
Mr. and Mrs. Geller, you look wonderful, it is great to have you hear, let us take off your coats!
Whoa, snowing out there?
No.
Monica, all this food looks wonderful, you should think about doing this for a living.
Ok, I have dandruff. There's no need to laugh and point.
Dad, Chandler was just laughing at your joke.
My joke wasn't funny.
Rach, Rach, I just remembered. I had a dream about Mr. Geller last night.
Really?!
Yeah, I dreamt that he saved me from a burning building and he was so brave and so strong! And it's making me look at him totally differently. Y'know, I mean he used to be just, y'know "Jack Geller Monica and Ross's dad" and now he's he's "Jack Geller, dream hunk."
I dunno. Y'know to me he'll always be "Jack Geller, walks in while you're changing."
Y'know dad, Chandler is one of Ross's very best friends!
Yeah, Ross sure is a great guy, y'know I've always felt that how a young man turns out is a reflection on his father.
I always thought that too. Tell me, what does your father do?
He's the headliner of a gay burlesque show.
Rach, you're killin' us here, will ya serve the dessert already? Those drunken dancers are waiting!
Look at it, isn't it beautiful?
Yeah, yeah, what is it?
It's a truffle. It's got all of these layers. First there's a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam, then custard, which I made from scratch, then raspberries, more ladyfingers, then beef sauteed with peas and onions, then a little more custard, and then bananas, and then I just put some whipped cream on top!
W-What was the one right before bananas?
The beef? Yeah, that was weird to me, too. But then, y'know, I thought "well, there's mincemeat pie," I mean that's an English dessert, these people just put very strange things in their food, y'know. Oh! by the way, can I borrow some Rum from your place?
Y-sure!
And while I'm gone don't you boys sneak a taste.
Okay.
Beef in a dessert?! I- no no no, there is no way!
I know, and only one layer of jam?! What is up with that?
Oh my God, the pages are stuck together!
Chandler!
Oh My God, she-she made half a English Trifle, and half a...Sheperd's Pie!
Oh man! Now she's gonna start all over! We're never gonna get to introduce the hot girls to the new world!
No, no, we will. We just won't tell her she messed up.
Just let her serve the beef-custard thing?
Yeah, it'll be like a funny Thanksgiving story!
Vomiting stories are funny...
Joey, God, your apartment is like a hundred degrees!
Did-did it make you wanna walk around in your underwear?
No!
Still not hot enough!
Rachel?
Yeah?
Okay, look at him. Look at those strong hands. Oh what I wouldn't give to be that can of condensed milk.
Mom, uh, Chandler was just saying how beautiful your sweater is.
Oh, thank you Chandler! I just bought it.
Oh, yes. Well it's very beautiful. It's cream-colored and tight I don't mean tight, I mean it's not too tight, not that I was looking at-
What's the matter with him?
I think he's stoned again.
What?
What?
Dude, I need to talk to you a sec.
Okay, I think I might know why my parents don't like you.
You do? Why?
Okay, remember, we were young. Hey, Spring break, sophomore year, I got high in my bedroom and my parents walked in and smelled it and so I told them that you had gotten stoned and jumped out the window.
What?! Why did you do that?
I don't know, aheh, your's was the first name that-that popped into my head, I'm I'm sorry. I-I didn't think it would matter.
How could it not matter?!
How was I supposed to know we'd end up being friends after college, let alone you-you would be living with my sister?
What about all that "friends forever" stuff?
I don't know, I-I was all high.
Mom and dad just sent me in here to find out if you were trying to get Ross stoned!
Your parents caught Ross smoking pot in college and he blamed it on me!
Ross, I can't believe you'd do that!
The reason we haven't told them we're together is because they hate me, okay? So will you fix this?
Okay, okay, I'll tell 'em it wasn't Chandler who got high. Now who should I say it was?
You! It's not like it's a big deal! You-you don't still do it or anything!
Alright, alright, now-now who should I say tricked me into doing it?
Dad, please don't pick your teeth out here! Alright, and if you're gonna put your feet up, why don't you sit on the-
Monica, leave him alone!
Will you hurry up? Did you not hear me before when I told you that all of Janine's friends are dancers?! And that they're going to be drinking alot!?
No, I did, but tell me again, because it's so romantic.
Well you're whippin' so slow! Can't you do it any faster?
Joey! Come on! I don't wanna make any mistakes, alright? This is the only dessert and if I screw it up everybody's gonna be like "Oh, remember that Thanksgiving when Rachel screwed up the trifle?"
So why don't you just let me worry about making the trifle and you just worry about eating it, alright?
Oh I am!
Ross, if you don't tell them, then I will!
Okay, fine!
Ross! Can I talk to you for a second?
Oh, uh, can it wait a second Joey? I have to tell my parents something. No it can't? Okay.
Okay, look, I think we have to tell Rachel she messed up her dessert.
What?! What is with everybody? It's Thanksgiving, not...Truth-Day!
Look, when everyone eats that...that...Banana-Meat thing, they're all gonna' make fun of her, do you want that?
Okay, okay, we'll just get everyone to act like they like it. That-that way noone makes fun of her and we still get to go to Sweet Potatoe Pie!
Dude, they're not objects.
Just kiddin,' I'll talk to them, you distract Rach.
Hey Rach, can I talk to you outside for a second?
Okay...
What's up, Ross?
So um...Thanksgiving. The holiday season is upon us, hm?
Yeah!
And um...You look nice today.
Oh no. No Ross, don't do this.
What?
I just- I don't think us getting back together is a good idea.
Eh?
I thought this might happen today. Ross, I know the holidays can be rough. Y'know? And it's probably really hard for you to be alone right now.
You're alone.
No, I-I live with Phoebe. I mean you're alone, alone. And I just-it's just not the time for us. I'm sorry.
Ah well, can't blame a guy for trying!
Oh and Okay, and uh if anyone needs help pretending to like it, I learned something in acting class, try uh, rubbing your stomach or uh, or saying "mmm" and uh, oh oh! And smiling , okay?
Yeah, I'm not gonna pay for those acting classes anymore.
Rachel, there you are! Come on, let's serve that dessert already!
Joey, you're gonna have to stop rushing me, you know what? You don't get any dessert.
Really?
No, I'm just kidding I would never do that to you! Okay, everybody, it's trifle time!
So, now, Rach, this is a traditional English trifle, isn't it?
It sure is.
Wow. So then did you make it with beef or Eggplant?
Beef.
I can't have any. You know I don't eat meat. Ohhh no.
Alright, Monica, I want you to have the first taste.
Really?
Oh oh oh, wait! You only got whipped cream in there! Ya gotta take a bite with all the layers!
Okay.
Op! Wait, you dropped a pea.
Well?
Mmmm! It's good!
Really? How good?
It's so good, that I feel really selfish about being the only one who's eating it, that I think we should have everyone taste how good it is. Especially Ross.
Mmm.
Yeah, this is so good, that I'm gonna go enjoy it on the balcony so that I can enjoy the view whilst I enjoy my dessert.
I've gotta call my friend Mary and tell her how good this is, from Monica's room.
I'll help you dial.
I'm gonna go into the bathroom so I can look at it in the mirror, as I eat it.
Okay, now what was that all about? Is it-does it not taste good? Let me try it.
Wha? No no! Ah! All gone! So good! Maybe Chandler has some left.
It tastes like feet!
I like it.
Are you kidding?
What's not to like? Custard? Good. Jam? Good. Meat? Gooooood.
...So a bird just grabbed it, and then tried to fly away with it and, and then just dropped it on the street?
Yes, but if it's any consolation, before the bird dropped it, he seemed to enjoy it.
Rachel, come here. Okay, I was just starting to take my Thanksgiving nap, and I had another dream about Jack.
Oh, Phoebe, do I wanna hear this?
I dunno, let's see! So, okay, I dreamt that we were gonna get married, and he left, becuz he had to go fight a fire. And, um, so okay, I went to a night club, and I saw him making out with a girl.
Oh my God, he dream-cheated on you!
Yeah, but then Jacques Cousteau came and he kicked his ass for betraying me! It was soo cool! Then, he took me diving and he introduced me to his pet seahorse, who, by the way, was totally coming on to me, and please, that is not gonna happen.
Boy, I'm glad I wore the big belt today.
Five minutes ago, a line like that would've floored me. Now nothing. Well, not nothing, I am still a woman.
Ross? Let's go.
Oh yeah, about telling Mom and Dad, I was thinking about maybe writing a letter.
Alright, you know what? That's it. You've had your chance.
Wha-what?
Mom! Dad! Ross smoked pot in college!
What?!
You are such a tattletale! Mom, Dad, you remember that-that time you walked in my room and smelled marijuana?
Yes.
Well I told you it was Chandler who was smoking the pot but it was me. I'm sorry.
It was you?
And Dad, y'know that mailman that you got fired? He didn't steal your Playboys! Ross did!
Yeah, well, Hurricane Gloria didn't break the porch swing, Monica did!
Ross hasn't worked at the museum for a year!
Monica and Chandler are living together!
Ross married Rachel in Vegas! And got divorced! Again!!!!
I love Jacques Cousteau!
I wasn't supposed to put beef in the trifle!
I wanna gooooooo!
That's alot of information to get in in thirty seconds! Alright Joey, if wanna leave, just leave. Rachel, no you weren't supposed to put beef in the trifle. It did not taste good. Phoebe, I'm sorry, but I think Jacques Cousteau is dead. Monica, why you felt you had to hide the fact that you were in an important relationship is beyond me.
And we kinda figured about the porch swing.
Ross, drugs? Divorced? Again?
What happened son?
I-I uh, I got tricked into all those things!
Chandler! You've been Ross's best friend all these years, stuck by him during the drug problems. And now you've taken on Monica as well. Well, I don't know what to say. You're a wonderful human being.
Thank you!
No! Thank you! Monica, and Ross! I don't know what I'm gonna do about the two of you!
I'll talk to them!
You guys! It was bananas, cream, and beef! I-I just cannot believe that you ate that so that I wouldn't feel bad!
Well actually, I-I didn't eat mine. It's still in the bathroom.
No it isn't, I ate that.
Well we left ours in Monica's bedroom.
Nope, got it and I got yours too.
Let me ask you, why is everybody using these tiny lights nowadays? I remember when people used to use big lights.
That's a good story, Grandpa.
Hey
Hey
Wow, Monica's letting other people help decorate her tree! Did someone get her drunk again or?
Having a perfectly decorated tree is not what Christmas is about. It's about being with the people that you love.
That is nice and we're done. TADA!
I dunno what it is, it just doesn't quite feel like Christmas to me.
Oh, here.
See now it feels like Christmas!
... and that's the story of the dreidle. Now, some people trace the Christmas tree back to the Egyptians, who used to bring green palm branches into their huts on the shortest day of the year, symbolising life's triumph over death. And that was like 4000 years ago.
So, pretty much around the same time that you started telling this story.
Hey you guys.
Hey Joe what's up?
I had to get out of the apartment. Janine is like stretching all over the place. Y'know, everywhere I look she's like...
I can see why that's hard to resist.
I like her so much!
Aw, I'm sorry sweetie that she doesn't feel the same way.
I know. And she's so sweet. I just wanna feed her grapes and brush her hair.
You are aware that she's not a monkey, right?
I am so over Janine. I mean, yeah, at first I thought she was hot, but now she's like OLD NEWS!
Hey guys!
Hi Janine!
I just got a call to be a dancer on a television special for New Year's Eve. It's called some sort of Dick'n Rock'n Dickie Eve.
Hold it! Are you talking about Dick Clark's New Year's Rocking Eve?
Yeah, that's what I said.
Oh my God! We love that show! I mean Ross and I have been watching it since I can remember!
Ah, you're still just a little fat girl inside aren't you?
Well I'm gonna be on it this year. I'm gonna be one of the party people.
You're gonna be a party person! Those guys rock the most!
Well they said I should bring someone. Do you wanna be my dance partner?
Totally! I would love to spend New Year's with you.
Well actually they're taping tomorrow. I don't really understand why.
Oh, well you see how it works is, the part with Dick Clark in Times Square is actually live, but they tape some of the party stuff ahead of time. Yeah, not a lot of people know that.
Yeah well, do you guys wanna come too?
Are you serious?
We are there!
What, what are you laughing at?
Well, I used to date him, but you're still going out with her!
Thanks. Great so we can all go together! I gotta run. Catch you later!
Bye!
Bye Janine!
Did she just ask me out on a date?
I don't think so.
What are you talking about? She just invited him to the biggest party of the millennium!
Yeah, but she also invited you and Ross. Yeah, honey, I'm sorry, but I don't think that was a romantic thing.
Oh. Maybe. But hey I know how I can find out. We're going to a New Year's Eve party, right? So at midnight, I can kiss her. And if she kisses me back, great! Y'know? But if she says 'Dude, what the hell are you doing?' I can say 'It wasn't me, it was New Years!'
Well, that's a lot better than Ross trying to kiss me in High School, and saying that he did it because he needed chapstick.
It was a dry day.
We are going to Dick Clark's New Year's Rocking Eve!
Oh my God!
Oh my God!
Oh my God!
OK, listen I've been on sets before, so let me give you a little advice, alright? It's a show, but we're just dancing, OK? It's no big deal. The important thing to remember &#150; stay cool.
Got it!
Oh my God it's just like I dreamed it!
OK, everyone gather up.
'Scuse us
Here's what's gonna happen. The music's gonna start, you're gonna dance, we're gonna tape, you don't look at the camera. Any questions?
Yeah, I have a question. When is this gonna air?
Uh, yeah. Now you guys dance over there, you guys over there, and I want you two right around here, and everyone else spread out.
Ross! So when is it gonna air?
Okay, you look in the kitchen, I will look in the back closet.
I can save you time ladies, I'm right here.
Yeah, Chandler why don't you take a walk? This doesn't concern you.
We are looking for our Christmas presents from Monica.
What? That's terrible!
No-no, we do it every year!
Oh well, that makes it not terrible.
No, yeah, we never find them! She's always best at us that wily minx.
Don't worry, we're just gonna search here for an hour, them we're gonna go over to Joey's and search, OK?
No not okay, you can't look for Monica's presents!
But we have to!
No, you don't have to, and you can't because I live here too.
Well then, you should look with us.
Why?
Chandler, aren't you worried about what to get Monica for Christmas?
No, I have a great idea for a present for her.
Oh, that's it? A great idea!
Chandler, that's not enough. I mean what if she gets you a great present, two medium presents, and a bunch of little presents? And you've just gotten her one great present? I mean that's just gonna make her feel bad. Why would you do that to her Chandler? Why? Why?
If I help, we can find 'em faster!
That's right!
Ooh ooh, we have a live one!
Oh, it's a Macy's bag!
Ooh, who's it for?
Dear losers, do you really think I'd hide presents under the couch? P.S. Chandler, I knew they'd break you.
Uh-oh. She may be onto us.
We are so gonna find them this year.
Y'know when you guys said you were gonna go across the hall and look, you don't, you don't do that every year do you?
Yeah.
You don't, like go into the back of my closet, and look under my gym bag or anything?
No, we never do that
Because that's where Joey gave me some stuff to store that I've never seen before in my life! Okay, that did not just happen!
Okay, here comes another camera.
Right. No biggie. Stay loose.
Why do they keep doing that?
If we wanna get on camera, I think we have to get up on one of those platforms. They've been taping those people up there all day.
Right.
Hey, what'd you guys do to get up on there?
We learned how to dance.
Oh yeah? Well when you learned how to dance did you forget how to put on underpants?
Yeah!
Hey! You're a good dancer!
Really?
Yeah, well you'd be better if you just loosened your hips a little.
What do you mean?
Like this.
That's it, feel the rhythm. That's better.
Uh-huh.
Okay, you're dancing with that girl over there.
No-no-no-no-no we came together!
I don't see it. You are dancing with the tall guy over there. Tall guy, raise your hand!
No-no hey buddy, please let me dance with that girl, I really like her and I think I have a shot.
Really, y'think so? I don't..
I couldn't find anything at Joey--Hey-hey, oh hey!
Yeah, we found them. There were in the guest room closet behind some coats.
Yeah, and you have nothing to worry about 'cos they're all crap!
Those are my gifts, I got them for you.
Ohhh. Thanks Chandler they're great!
Well Chandler, what is this very weird, metal A Z thing?
Those are book ends! That's a great gift!
Oh, okay, I'm sorry, thank you for my azzz.
Ha!
Make sure you put all that stuff back in the closet, okay?
Yes, okay, oh, by the way, I just gotta say, I think it's really nice of you that even after you've moved, you still keep storing that stuff for Joey!
Hey-hey dancer girl! Can I go to the bathroom? I just.. Here we go. Looking good Gellers!
We know!
Hey, see that snippy guy over there? He's the one who decides who gets up on the platform. We should go dance by him.
Okay.
Okay, everybody hold!
Next on the platforms are... ...you two! And... ...You two!
Excuse me, sir, would it help if I weren't wearing underpants?
Monica! Would it?
Hey! Tall guy! Hey, listen, I wanted to talk to you about that girl that you're dancing with.
She's nice, huh? To think I almost brought my wife to this!
Yeah, yeah, okay. Uh, look buddy, I came with that girl, and I had this plan to kiss her at the new years countdown &#150; I'm trying to win her over, so I was wondering if..
No I don't think so.
Oh come on man, you can dance with my partner, she's real, uh, mellow!
Look, are you dating this girl you came with?
Well, I was hoping after tonight that maybe I could you know...
No, no. She's fair game if you ask me, sorry buddy!
Alright, alright, hey y'know fair is fair, if you're right, you're right, what can I say, but hey oh no!
God! What are you, in second grade?
Hey, now you're the one who wet his pants.
Man, this sucks! Y'know if Mom and Dad don't see us on TV after we made them so jealous, I mean, who's gonna be the losers then?
Hey, I know what'll get us up on a platform!
What?
The routine!
Ross, we haven't done the routine since middle school.
Hey, when the snippy guy sees the routine, he'll wanna build us our own platform!
Was it really that good?
We got honourable mention in the brother/sister dance category! Look, it's almost fake midnight, do we really have any other choice?
Okay, let's do it. Mom and Dad are gonna be so faced!
5 6 7 8!
So, do we really have to ask who's going up on the platform next?
Oh no! You get up there and do that again exactly like that!
Yes!
Make sure you get this, they're gonna want it for the bloopers show. Alright cut! Listen up everyone, when we start again it's gonna be the countdown to new years, so I wanna see everybody's excitement.
Hey, pal, you have about three seconds to get away from my partner.
What's going on over here?
Uh, take a look at the guy's pants! I mean, I know you told us to show excitement, but don't you think he went a little overboard?
What's the matter with you? Get out of here!
Yeah, take a hike wetpants!
Can you believe this? We're gonna be on the platform for the Millennium moment!
I know! Hey, you haven't been practising the routine, have you?
No!
Me too!
Hey, when the music starts up again, I was thinking of maybe goind into the robot, y'know?
Ross, I think we should stick to the routine, we don't wanna look stupid!
Alright we're back! Ten seconds left here we go! Ten! Nine! Eight! Seven!
Okay, it all comes down to this. Whatever happens, happens. Destiny.
Three, Two, One!
Cut!
No! Year! Happy No Year!
Okay, here's where we go to the live shot of Times Square, nice work everyone that's a wrap!
Hey! Look who I found!
Oh, hey guys!
Y'know, birds have a very good sense of direction, and I thought maybe they could help us find where the presents are hidden.
Yes, if the presents are hidden south for the winter.
Or we could just follow your clever jokes &#150; any ideas? No! Didn't think so! Okay, c'mon guys, show us where the presents are!
Oh, the duck seems to think that Monica got me garbage! Hmm, I wonder what I could get Monica that's as good as garbage?
Hmm, how about my azzz?
Hey, this is hollow.
What?
This bench, it's hollow! I can't believe I never knew that! Oh, the presents!!!
No, don't look directly at them!
What?
Alright, no, we could look at them!
Oh, this one's for me!
Oh, this one's for Chandler. Here.
Oh great!
And the big one's for me!
Ooh, let's open them!
Okay! Okay! Okay!
Hee hee!
Wait, we can't do this.
Why?
I don't wanna know what Monica got me. Y'know? I mean, look, I'm sure she worked really hard at getting you a present, and wanting to surprise me, and you guys are gonna ruin that, and I, look we have to put these back, this is not what Christmas is about.
Whatever Linus, I'm opening mine.
Nobody is opening anything ok? Look, I don't know about you guys, but I wanna see the look on Monica's face when I give her my present, and I'm sure she wants to see the look on my face when I get mine. So please, please, can we just, can we put them back?
Will you get us better gifts?
Fine!
Hey guys! You found the presents? Chandler, you let them find the presents? Great! Do you know how long it took me to find you that water purifier?
That's what you got me?
Oh yes, I see what you mean. That look is priceless.
Home sweet home, huh? Nice to, uh, get back to reality. Plus we know how the New Year's gonna go off. I guess there's no reason for all that Y2K panic, y'know? Anyway, g'night!
Joey.
Yeah?
3, 2, 1. Happy New Year.
Oh, yoii. What was that for?
Well, I don't know tonight when they yelled cut and we didn't get to kiss, I was really, really, disappointed, and I just, really wanted to kiss you
Really? In the moment, I really wanted to kiss you too. In the moment.
In the moment, yeah.
But only in the moment. So do ya wanna kiss again?
Sure, New Year's Eve is only two weeks away. Can you wait?
No.
Me neither.
3, 2,
Joey, you don't have to count down every time we kiss.
Uh, yeah, okay. Except I sorta felt like I needed a couple of seconds to get ready.
We were on the platform, ready to dance the world into the new Millennium, and the guy yelled 'CUT!'
Uh, wait, so you guys are telling me you actually did the routine from eighth grade?
Yeah. But of course we had to update it a little bit. Hey, by the way, great thinking about catching me!
'Cos I was gonna say there's no way you could've done the end the way you guys did it back then!
What? We could do it!
I don't know, I mean you were a lot bigger, I mean, stronger back then.
I can do it, okay? Come on, let's go.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
I can't do it!
Now you do that, you're on TV.
Hey!
Hey!
Listen, do you guys think I have a chance with Janine?
Honey, we have been through this before!
Yeah. Don't do this to yourself.
She's made it pretty clear, it is not going to happen.
Well all right then, I guess I shouldn't get to excited about the fact that I just kissed her!
You serious?!
That's great!
Really?!
Yeah well, we'll see.
You kissed her.
Oh we kissed it up real nice.
So you kissed her, so what happened after that?
I came over here to tell you guys.
So she's just waiting over there for ya?
I gotta go.
Okay.
I'm gonna be really late for dance class!
Okay.
Okay, now I'm really late.
Okay, I'm all right, okay, but hey, could you just leave your lips?
Bye.
Bye.
Have you kissed her yet? It's awesome! I could do it forever! Y'know what? She-she kisses better than my mom cooks!
I am so glad you said cooks.
I know.
Oh hey Rachel, sweetheart? You have got to tell the post office that you have moved. Okay? We are still getting all your bills and stuff.
Oh-oh, Pottery Barn! You can throw the rest away.
I'm not your garbage man. I'm your mailman.
Monica look! Look-look-look! Here is that table that I ordered.
You got it from Pottery Barn?!
Yeah! It's an apothecary table. Does anyone even know what an apothecary is?
A pharmacist.
Rach, Phoebe hates Pottery Barn.
I hate Pottery Barn too. They kicked me out of there just because I sat on a bed!
You took off your pants and climbed under the sheets!
I was tired!
Phoebe hates Pottery Barn?!
Yeah, she hates all mass produced stuff. She thinks her furniture should have a history, a story behind it.
Well this has story behind it! I mean they had to ship it all the way from the White Plains store.
It's gotta be one of a kind. Y'know like umm, y'know uh, what's that God awful ceramic fruit bowl she has on her counter?
Hey! I made that for her!
You made pottery?
Yeah! I made it of this fruit bowl I found in the garbage.
I'm telling-If you put that in her apartment you'll never hear the end of it.
Okay fine! I'll-I'll just tell her it's an antique apothecary table, she doesn't have to know where it came from. Oh! Look at this little drawers! Oh look-look it says that it holds 300 CDs.
Ahh, just like the apothecary tables of yore...
...so then the farmer says, "That's not a cow and you're not milking it."
I am so glad you guys got together, Chandler and I are always looking for a couple to go out with and now we have one!
Look at us, we're a couple of couples!
I had so much fun tonight, and what a great restaurant.
Yeah.
And Chandler I can't believe I let you pay for this one. Thanks man.
So do you guys gonna come over tomorrow? I'll make that pasta thing I was telling you about.
Oh that would be great!
Oh, but hey look, at least let us bring the wine.
Joey, you don't have too!
Nope-op! I insist! You get the wine right?
Yeah all right. Okay, good night guys.
See ya tomorrow!
Tomorrow!
Can't wait!
How are we gonna get out of that one?
What?
I can't handle two nights in a row with them.
What-what's wrong with Monica and Chandler?
I don't know, they're just a little blah!
Blah?!
Well y'know, he's blah, she's just-she's very loud for such a small person.
Uh, they're like my best friends. Are you saying we can't hang out with them? 'Cause that would kinda be a problem.
No! Of course we can still hang out with them. Just y'know, not two nights in a row. Okay?
I guess.
Thank you.
If you want, I'll sell my friends and use the money to buy you presents.
Hey!
Hey!
Ooh, what a great table! Where-where did you get it?
Guess!
Umm, a flea market?
Ha! See, I knew, I knew you'd get it on the first guess. Isn't it cool! It's an apothecary table.
Wow! Oh you can just imagine that this is where they kept all the stuff to make their potions.
Ohh, yes.
Y'know? Ooh, you can almost smell the opium.
Almost.
How much was it?
It was only 500 bucks.
500 bucks at a flea market?!
Oh, okay see I thought, I thought you meant how much was it when it was new, y'know like back then.
Oh no.
Yeah no, I mean it was at a flea market, so it was y'know, it was like a dollar.
A dollar?
And fifty. So it was like one and fifty dollars.
Ohh, okay, they gave you the old time pricing.
Yeah.
Well, what period is it from?
Uh, it's from yore. Like the days of yore. Y'know?
Yes, yes I do. God, oh it's just perfect! Wow! I bet it has a great story behind it too. Did they tell you anything? Like y'know where it was from or...
Yes! That I know, this is from White Plains.
White Plains. Oh, it sounds like such a magical place.
Hey! We're here!
Hey!
Ohh! Oh my God!
You like it?
Oh no!
It's my new apothecary table!
Ross! Phoebe's gonna be here any second, she cannot see this!
Well why not?! She'll-she'll love it! It's the real thing! I got it at Pottery Barn.
I know you did! I bought the same one! And if she sees your table she's gonna know that I lied to her. I told her ours was an original.
Why did you do that?
Because she hates Pottery Barn.
She hates Pottery Barn?!!
I know! I know, she says it's all mass-produced, nothing is authentic, and everyone winds up having the same stuff. So come on, she's gonna be here any second! Can we please just cover this up with something?! Please?
What? No! No! I am not gonna hide it from Phoebe-Ooh, although I did get some great Pottery Barn sheets!
Ooo! Oh, I forgot they made sheets!
Uh, yeah! I still can't believe she hates Pottery Barn!
Ross, get over it! It's not like she hates you.
Yeah but Pottery Barn! Y'know what I think? It's just she-she's weird. Y'know it's because she's a twin. Twins are weird.
Ross, she's not weird, she just wants her stuff to be one of a kind.
Huh. Y'know what's not one of a kind? A twin!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Ooh, Phoebe's here! Okay, let's turn out all the lights and we'll just watch the movie!
Okay. Hey-Ooh, cool sheets!
Oh, you like it? You wanna know where I got it?
Sure!
He got it a flea market!
You bought your sheets at a flea market? Ross come on, you gotta loosen the purse strings a little.
Hey!
Hi!
The dinner will be ready in twenty minutes. This is so exciting.
And here is the bottle of wine for you to bring over tonight. You were also going to buy Monica flowers but you couldn't afford it, because you paid dinner last night.
Thanks. Thanks, but uh actually it's just gonna be me again tonight.
What happened to Janine?
Oh, she's uh-uh really sick.
Oh that's too bad.
Yeah, she's been in there all day , uh high fever, a nose problem... Phlegm! Phlegm! Phlegm-phlegm-phlegm!
Monica! Chandler! I'm really-really sorry about tonight. I don't know if Joey told you; I just couldn't get out of going to this play. I'm sorry. Have a great time.
'Kay!
Bye.
That's funny, I saw no phlegm.
No-no, she really is sick!
Then why-why is she going to a play?!
Uh, y'know, starve a fever, go to a play for a cold.
Joey! Why is Janine not coming over for dinner?!
Well uh, she didn't want to hang out with you guys two nights in a row. I'm so sorry.
Well, why does she not want to hang out with us?!
Because she uh, she-she thinks that you are blah and that you, Monica, are too loud.
What?!! What?
So she was just pretending to have a good time last night? She was lying to our faces?!
Ugh, I can not believe this! I mean, who is she to judge us? We could not have been nicer to her!
And I am not blah, I am a hoot!
I know! I know! Come on, please-please you guys, don't-don't be mad. I'm sure she just, she just said that stuff because she was nervous and you guys are like my best friends! Y'know? And it was our first date! Plus, she's really sick!
No, you sh-No you said you made that up!!
I know, but don't you think the sick thing is way better than the play thing?
Eh, they're both good. I generally just go with, Monica's drunk again.
Come on you guys, come on please-please just give her another chance, huh? She'll come around I promise.
Of course we will, come on we gotta make dinner.
Okay.
I do not like that woman!
I can hear you!
I am loud!
Aww!
That's funny.
Hey Pheebs, could you please not put your feet up on my new......old sheet?
Oh sure! Noo!
Ohh!!
My apothecary table!!!
What?!
Noooooo!!
Ross, where did you get this?!
I got it at Pottery Barn!! Okay?!
Oh my God, Phoebe, Pottery Barn has ripped off the design of our antique!
Wow! Oh my God, well if they've ripped off our table ours must be much more than one and fifty dollars!
Oh yes.
Well this doesn't even smell like opium.
Of course not, it smells like wine, which you spilled! And thanks for wrecking my sheet by the way.
Oh Ross, calm down, I'll give you the 80 cents.
Okay, one more time.
Chandler, would you like some more orange juice?
Perfect decibel.
I know!!!
Hey!
Hey.
So uh, what are you guys doing?
Oh nothing, we're just talking. Y'know, blah-blah-blah.
Look, come on you guys, you said you were gonna try! All right look, I came over here to invite you guys to a movie with me and Janine.
Well, I'd like to but, I'm not sure we have time to go.
Ha-ha, very funny-Look! I don't know what to do! I really want you guys to get along. Just please come to the movie with us. I mean you owe me!
We owe you?!
That's right! I helped you guys out a lot in the start of your relationship. Huh? I helped you guys sneak around for like six months, and I looked like an idiot! And I was humiliated. And I only made 200 dollars!
We didn't give you any money!
You don't think I know that!
...see I can't decide whether it would go better next to the new wicker dining chair, the Sahara desk, or the Parker console table.
Wow! I didn't know that there was a Pottery Barn up here.
I know, I know. I went a little crazy.
A little? Your place looks like page 72 of the catalogue. Oh look at that! The ornamental bird cage! Large!
Hey!
Hey.
Oh Ross no. Be careful, that is very old! Okay? Early Colonial bird merchants used to bring their birds to market in that.
Fascinating.
Another amazing find! Wow! Oh I bet this has a great story too!
Oh it does, it does! It is a room separating apparatus from Colonial times.
Ah!
Hmm, a lot of this stuff is from Colonial times. Hey, what are some other time periods Rachel?
Well there's yore. And uh, y'know, yesteryear.
Yeah no, I'm telling you Rachel has such a great eye for this stuff. Ross, y'know if you ever decide you need to redecorate-And I think that you should. You should, you should ask Rachel to help.
Oh honey he doesn't need my help.
Oh, come on! I think he's ready to get rid of, what did you call it? The cheap knock-offs and dinosaur junk.
Really?! Hey, y'know what? Since you have such a great sense of what I need, uh ooh, here's-here's 60 bucks, why don't you take Phoebe down to that Colonial flea market of yours and get me some stuff.
Y'know what? I don't, I don't think Phoebe really wants to come.
No! I do want to!
Oh, she does want to.
She does want to.
Yeah!
Pheebs, I don't know what to say. I guess the flea market was just better last time.
Well at least I got these sheets for Ross.
Yeah.
Uck, look at this! Pottery Barn, yuck!
Yeah, y'know what? Don't look at it. Seriously, don't look at it.
No! Look-look! There's the coffee table they stole from us!
Ugh, those bastards! Let's go.
That fan kinda looks like ours. And the birdcage and the...wait a sec! This is our exact living room!
No! No! No! No it's not! No it's not! Come on! Phoebe, ours is totally different! I mean we don't have the... We don't have the...that lamp! And-and that screen is y'know, on the other side.
Oh my God. This is where you got all our stuff, Pottery Barn! Oh my God!
Okay! Okay-okay look-no I did, I just wanted this stuff and I know how you feel about Pottery Barn. Just... Come on don't be mad.
No-no-no, but I am mad! I am mad! Because this stuff is everything that is wrong with the world! And it's all sitting up in my living room and all I can think about is how I don't have that lamp!
Well then honey, buy the lamp! Hey, we have that 60 bucks from Ross.
I can't! I can't! Unless... Well are you saying that-that you would move out if-if I didn't buy that lamp?
What?! No! I'm not gonna move out!
But are you saying that you would move out if I didn't buy that lamp?
Oh. Yes! I would so move out!
Okay then I don't have a choice! I have to buy that lamp!
That's right!
But at least the apothecary table is real.
Well, this-this-this was great. Didn't everybody have a great time?
Well I did. I really did. And you guys, I've got to say, I'm sorry if I was a little weird after the last time we went out. I guess I was just nervous or something.
That's totally understandable.
Don't worry about it.
So we can go out again?
Oh yeah!
Absolutely!
Oh good.
Oh well then, good night!
Good night!
See? Eh, wasn't that fun?
We have got to move!
I knew it!! Y'know, you're not so quiet yourself, missy!
And I'm blah? Listen, the only thing more boring than watching modern dance is having to listen to you talk about it, "Oh Chandler, I just lost myself in the moment."
Y'know, I know you're talking, but all I hear is, "Blah. Blah. Blah-blah-blah."
All right! You and me! Let's go! Right now!
All right! All right! Enough! Enough! Enough!! Enough! You two go home! I-I-I gotta talk to Janine!
Y'know I think you can take her.
You'd better hope I don't see you in the hallway!!
All right, uh, we've got a little bit of a problem here. These people are my friends; you can't treat them that way.
They said stuff to me too, y'know!
I know! I know! And I'm going to talk to them about it. They mean so much to me. They... They're like my family. If you guys are gonna be fighting all the time, I-I... I don't think we can be together. It just, it just can't work. It can't. I'm very upset.
Okay. Okay. Would, would it help if I went over and apologized?
Yeah! Yeah! That would be very helpful! Yeah.
What did I tell you about the hall?!
I was just coming over here to apologize for my behavior! I'd really like it if we could be friends.
Well, I know that would make Joey happy, so, I would like that too.
Great.
Now come on. Well, I'm glad we worked things out.
Me too.
Okay.
I'll see you.
Bye.
Or I'll hear you.
That's it big girl! Come on!
Wait!
You'd better run!
Did you hear that?
Yeah uh, what am I gonna do?
Yeah, I'm sorry man. You wanna go watch?
Yeah!
Hey!
How ya doin'?
Hey so, did uh, did she move out?
Pretty much, yeah.
I cannot believe you broke up with her just like that.
Well, when it's not right, you know it.
You okay?
Yeah! Yeah. I'll be all right.
Y'know what would cheer you up?
What?
I'm giving this lecture on erosion theories tomorrow night, I think you should come.
You're right! That did cheer me up!
Hey, you're not going to believe this. I made up a joke and sent it in to Playboy. They printed it!
I didn't know Playboy prints jokes.
Yeah, they print jokes, interviews, hard-hitting journalism. It's not just about the pictures.
That didn't work on mom, it's not going to work on us.
Here, check it out. It's the first one, too.
That is funny. It was also funny when I made it up.
What?
I made that joke up.
Uh, oh-oh, no you didn't. I did.
Yes, I did. I told it to Dan at work, and he said it was the funniest joke he'd ever heard.
Hey, tell Dan, 'Thanks.'
What?
I'm sorry, I was just reading the joke below it. Man, that one is funny.
Monica, you remember me telling you that joke, right?
No.
Seriously?
Well, you tell a lot of jokes!
Look, Chandler, it's my joke. But, hey, if it makes you feel any better they don't print the name, so it doesn't really matter who gets credit, right?
Yeah, I guess.
Hey guys.
Hey, Joey, Playboy printed my joke.
No, it's my joke, it's mine. You can call them, they'll tell you.
It's my joke.
It's my joke.
Whoa-whoa-whoa. Jokes? You guys know they have naked chicks in there, right?
Dude, you have got to turn on Behind the Music. The band Heart is having a really tough time, and I think they may break up.
Let's go watch it at your place.
Nah, Monica's watching some cooking show. Come on, I don't want to miss when they were skinny.
Chandler, Chandler, y'know what we should do? You and I should go out and get some new sunglasses.
What? No, I want to watch this. . Did your cable go out?
No, that's VH-1. I gotta tell you, the music these kids listen to today . . . It's like a lotta noise to me. I don't know...
Joey, why is your cable out?
I uh, oh! Because, uh, I haven't really paid the bill
If you need money, will you please-please just let me loan you some money?
No, Chandler. Look, forget about it, okay? Look, I know things have been a little tight since Janine moved out. Oh, was she hot.
Whoa ho.
I know! Yeah, but, look I can handle it. All right? Look, I can listen to the radio, huh? And Ross gave me this great book .
All right, you want to see if the joke stealer will let us watch the show at his place?
Sure.
Paid your phone bill?
Not so much.
Hey.
It's only you.
Wh-wh-what are you doing?
We are looking at a Playboy.
Oh, I want to look too! . Yikes!
So do you think that these pictures-Are, are they trying to tell a story?
Oh, yeah, sure. I mean, like in the case of this young woman, she has lost her clothes, so she rides naked on the horse, she's crying out, 'Where are they, where are they?'
Well, she's not going to find them lying in the grass like that.
Oh, yeah. Aw, remember the days when you used to go out to the barn, lift up your shirt, and bend over?
Yeah.
You see, now, I would date this girl. She's cute, she's outdoorsy, you know, and she knows how to build a fire. I mean, that's got to come in handy
Okay, I've got a question. If you had to pick one of us to date, who would it be?
I don't know.
Me neither.
Rachel.
What?!
I don't know. Me neither.
You forget how many great songs Heart had.
Yeah.
You know, Barracuda was the first song I learned to play on the keyboard.
So, you heard it, you repeated it, so that must mean you wrote it.
Oh, you guys, with this joke. I gotta say, I know I cracked up, but I'm not even sure I got it.
What, you didn't get it? The doctor is a monkey.
And monkeys can't write out prescriptions.
You are not allowed to laugh at my joke.
Your joke? Well, I think 'the Hef' would disagree, which is why he sent me a check for one hundred ah-dollars.
So, you stole my joke, and you stole my money.
Well, I was going to stick it in the ATM, but now I think I'll show the sexy teller that I am a published writer.
Well, she is going to know that you stole the joke.
Oh, what are you going to do, follow me down there?
Yeah!
Well, I'm not going to go now anyway .
Okay .
Here you go.
Ah, Gunther, I can't pay for this right now because I'm not working, so I've had to cut down on some luxuries like uh, payin' for stuff.
Well, if you want, you can work here.
Uh, I don't know. Ya see, it's just, see I was a regular on a soap opera y'know? And to go from that to this, I just... Plus, I'd have to wait on all my friends.
Okay, but the money's good, plus you get to stare at Rachel as much as you want.
What?!
Flexible hours.
Maybe I could be a waiter. Could I use the phone?
She picked Rachel. I mean, she tried to back out of it, but it was obvious. She picked Rachel.
He took my joke, he took it.
It's wrong. You know what else is wrong? Phoebe picking Rachel.
You know who else picked Rachel? Ross, and you know what else Ross did? He stole my joke. You know what? I'm going to get a joke journal. Y'know? And document the date and time of every single one of my jokes.
That's a good idea.
Yeah!
Do you know what's a bad idea?
Picking Rachel.
That's right. Did you hear something?
Maybe it's the sound of Ross climbing into my brain and stealing my thoughts.
It's coming from the living room.
I finished my book.
Hey, you guys.
Hey.
Oh, don't you guys look cute. You guys make such a cute couple.
Monica, what are you doing?
Nothing, I'm just trying to recreate some of the fun that we had at my place the other day. Remember, when you picked Rachel over me? That was funny.
I guess it was kinda funny.
It wasn't funny at all! Why would you do that? Why didn't you pick me?
Fine. The reason that I was leaning a little bit more toward Rachel than you is just that you're ... just ... kinda high maintenance-Okay let's go to lunch!
That is completely untrue. You think I'm high maintenance? Okay, prove it. I want you to make a list and we're going to go through it point by point!
No, okay, you're right. You're easy-going. You're just not as easy-going as Rachel. She's just more flexible and-and mellow. That's all.
Well, people are different.
Ya, you know, Rachel ... she'll do whatever you want. Y'know, you can just walk all over her.
What? Wait a minute. What are you saying, that I'm a pushover? I'm not a pushover.
Oh, okay, you're not a pushover.
Oh my ... you think I'm a pushover. Well wait, watch this, you know what? You're not invited to lunch. What do you think of that? I think that's pretty strong, that's what I think. Come on, Monica, let's go to lunch.
You start working on that list.
I cannot believe her.
I know. Where do you wanna go eat?
Oh, oh, I love that Japanese place.
I'm sick of Japanese. We're not going there.
All right, wherever you wanna go is cool.
All right.
Oh, hey, Gunther, check this out.
Yeah, that-that Chandler cracks me up.
Hey Ross, listen, you want anything to drink, 'cause I'm heading up there.
Uh, yeah, I'll take a coffee. Thanks, man.
Sure. Coffee? 'Cause I'm going up there.
No.
No, thank you.
You guys need anything, 'cause I'm heading up there.
I'd love an ice water.
You got it.
Joey, what are you doing?
Just being friendly.
Joey, honey, I don't think you're supposed to go back there.
Nah, it's okay. Right, Gunther?
Don't wink at me. And put on your apron.
Okay, but I don't see you asking any other paying customers to put on aprons.
Joey, do you work here?
No.
Hey, waiter.
Yeah?
Joey, what's going on. What didn't you tell us you work here?
It's kind of embarrassing, y'know. I mean, I was an actor and now I'm a waiter. It's supposed to go in the other direction.
So is your apron. You're wearing it like a cape.
I mean, the job's easy and the money's good, you know? I guess I'm going to be hanging out here anyway. I might as well get paid for it, right? I just feel kind of weird serving you guys.
Come on, Joey, I did it and it was fine.
Yeah, why would it be weird? Hey, Joey, can I get some coffee?
Okay, I guess it doesn't seem that weird.
Seriously, I-I asked you before and you still haven't gotten it.
See, now it's weird again.
I Think It's Great That You Work Here. You'Re Going To Make A Lot Of Money, And Here's Your First Tip. Don't eat yellow snow. . Ah ha ha, 2:15, coffeehouse.
Well, you know what? This is great. Finally, I have someone I can pass on my wisdom too. Let me tell you about a couple of things I learned while working at the coffeehouse. First of all, the customer is always right. A smile goes a long way. And if anyone is ever rude to you? Sneeze muffin.
Thanks, Rach. Look, you guys are just terrific. Y'know? Now, how about clearing out of here so I can get some new customers. It's all about turnover.
Joey, seriously, can I get my coffee?
Oh, I'm sorry, Ross. I'll get it for you right now. And since I made you wait, I'll toss in a free muffin.
Phoebe. We would like to talk to you for a second.
Okay.
So, maybe I am a little high maintenance. And maybe Rachel is a little bit of a pushover. But you know what we decided you are?
Yes, we are very sorry to tell you this, but you, Phoebe, are flaky.
Hah!
That true, I am flaky.
So, what, you're just, you're just okay with being flaky?
Yeah, totally.
Well, then, I'm okay with being high maintenance.
Yeah, and I am okay with being a pushover.
That's great. Good for you guys.
I am not high maintenance!
I am not a pushover!
Who said you were?
You did!
Oh, I'm flaky. I'll say anything.
Hey, Gunther. Can you uh, can you cover for me? I just got an audition.
No, I'm leaving to get my hair dyed.
Really?! I like your natural color. Come on man, it's a great part. Look, check it out. I'm the lead guy's best friend and I wait for him in this bar and save his seat. Listen-listen. 'I'm sorry, that seat's saved.'
That's the whole part?
Okay, maybe he's not his best friend, but ...
Okay, I'll see you in an hour.
Oh, man, I could totally get that part. 'I'm sorry, that seat is taken.'
Oh, excuse me.
No, no, I didn't mean you. But, you believed me, huh?
I believed you were saving this seat for someone.
So, you'd hire me, right?
For what?
Exactly! All right, everybody, listen up. The coffeehouse is going to be closed for about an hour.
Huh? What?
Yeah, it's for the kids. To keep the kids off drugs. It's a very important issue in this month's Playboy. I'm sure you all read about it.
It's my joke.
It's my joke.
It's my joke.
Y'know, I don't think we're going to settle this.
Let's have Monica decide.
Yeah!
Yeah!
Hey Mon.
Mon, get out here!
Monica!
Okay, okay. You have to help us decide whose joke this is.
Why do I have to decide?
Because you're the only one that can be fair.
Yeah.
I can't be fair. You're my boyfriend.
Yeah, but I'm your brother. We're family. That's the most important thing in the world.
Don't try to sway her. I'm your only chance to have a baby. Okay, let's go.
We'll each tell you how we came up with the joke and then you decide which one of us is telling the truth-me.
Okay, Chandler, you go first.
Okay, I thought of the joke two months ago at lunch with Steve.
Oh, wait, is he the guy I met at Christmas?
Can I finish my story?!
Do you want me to pick you?!
See, I would never snap at you like that.
Continue.
So Steve said he had to go to the doctor. And Steve's doctor's name is Doctor Muppy. So I said, 'Doctor Monkey?' And that is how the whole Doctor Monkey thing came up.
Are you kidding? Okay, look. I-I studied evolution. Remember, evolution? Monkey into man? Plus, I'm a doctor, and I had a monkey. I'm Doctor Monkey!
I'm not arguing with that.
All right, I've heard enough. I've made my decision.
You are both idiots. The joke is not funny, and it's offensive to women, and doctors, and monkeys! You shouldn't be arguing over who gets credit, you should be arguing over who gets blamed for inflicting this horrible joke upon the world! Now let it go! The joke sucks!
It's your joke.
Is not.
Hi, Chandler. There you are.
Hi, oh hi.
Hey, it's Phoebe and Rachel. Um, why don't you tell them what you were telling me earlier about me not being high maintenance?
Monica is a self-sufficient, together lady. Being with her has been like being on a vacation. And what may be perceived as high maintenance is merely attention to detail and--generosity of spirit.
Wow, you know what? That is the best fake speech I think I've ever heard.
Really? I've heard better.
Wait, wait, he came up with that himself. Tell them, Chandler.
I'm out of words. Should I just say the whole thing again?
Look, I am not high maintenance. I am not. Chandler!
You're a little high maintenance.
Ahhh! You are on my list.
I'm sorry. You're not easy-going, but you're passionate, and that's good. And when you get upset about the little things, I think that I'm pretty good about making you feel better about that. And that's good too. So, they can say that you're high maintenance, but it's okay, because I like ... maintaining you.
I didn't even tell him to say that. . All right you're off my list.
I'm off the list.
Phoebe, it's okay that you don't want me to be your girlfriend because I have the best boyfriend.
Y'know, suddenly I find you very attractive.
Hey, buddy boy, how'd the audition go?
Not good, no. I didn't get the part, and I lost my job here, so ...
Wow! That is a bad audition.
How-how did you lose your job here?
Well, I had the audition but Gunther said I had to stay here and be in charge so he could go get his hair dyed. So, I went anyway, and then he fired me.
He left work in the middle of the day to do a personal errand and left you in charge when you've been working here two days? That's not, that's not right.
Yeah, what are ya gonna do?
Joey, you can't let him get away with that. Ya know what, I'm not going to let him get away with that. I'm going to say something to him-No, I really shouldn't say anything-No, I should say something to him. Gunther, I want you to give Joey his job back. That is really not fair that you have to fire him...
Okay.
What?
He can have his job back.
That's right, he can have his job back. I'm glad we got that all straightened out. There you go, Joey, you got your job back.
That's great. Thanks Rach.
Yeah, pretty nice, huh? Now who's a pushover?
Rach, you're in my seat.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Hey, I never got to hear who you guys would pick to be your girlfriend.
I pick you, Phoebe.
Oh, yeah. Definitely you, Pheebs.
Yeah, well, I kinda thought.
Hey.
Hey. Oh, I have a question. If-if-if one of you had to pick one of the other two guys to go out with, who would you pick?
No way.
I'm not answering that.
Joey! No way. I'm not answering that.
Okay Rach, that muffin and espresso, $4.50. Ross, double latte, $2.75. Chandler, coffee and a scone, $4.25. And Pheebs, herbal tea, $1.25. So, all together that's $12.75.
This coming from the man who couldn't split our 80 dollar phone bill in half.
Hi!
Hi!
How much do I owe you for the muffin and the latte?
Oh that's on the house courtesy of Joey Tribbiani.
Oh great! Well, tell him thanks. And since uh, Joey seems like such a nice guy, maybe we could go on a date sometime?
Well, he's not used to women being so forward with him; but uh, I good check with him-He says it's okay. Great! Thanks! Bye-bye!
Hey Joey, how come our stuff isn't free?
It will be when you look like that in a tight skirt! This is great! I'm getting more dates than ever!
Wait a minute, you're only giving free stuff away to the pretty girls?
Yeah Joey that is so gross!
How about a scone on the house baby?
I'm pretty.
Hey does anyone have any gum?
Oh I do! Oh, y'know what? No. Wait a second. I know it's in here somewhere.
Y'know what? I'm good! I'm good!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey, what are you doing here? Shouldn't you be at work?
Ugh, they sent me home. They said I can't work if I'm sick.
Ohh!
I'm so sorry you're sick.
I'm not sick!! I don't get sick! Getting sick is for weaklings and for pansies!
Honey, no one thinks you're a pansy, but we do think you need a tissue.
I have not been sick in over three years!
I'm gonna grab you some tissue.
I don't need a tissue! I'm fine-d!
When you put a 'D' at the end of 'Fine' you're not fine.
I'm fine-d. I'm fine-d! Y'know, it's a really hard word to say.
Yes?
Hi, is Rachel here? I'm her sister.
Oh my God, Jill!
Oh my God, Rachel!
Oh my God, introduce us!
This is Chandler.
Hi!
And you know Monica and Ross!
Hi Jill.
And that's Phoebe , and that's Joey.
Hey, how you doin'?
Don't!! Honey, what are you doing here?!
Which-which sister is this? Is this the spoiled one or that's bitter?
Daddy cut me off.
Never mind, I got it.
And y'know what I said to him? "I'm gonna hire a lawyer and I'm gonna sue you and take all your money. Then I'm gonna cut you off!"
Wow! What did he say?
That he wouldn't pay for my lawyer! Then he told me to come here and learn about the value of money from the one daughter he's actually proud off.
Oh! Did you hear that?! My dad's proud of me! My dad's proud of me.
Rach?
Oh yeah, sorry. Wait honey, so what did you do that made dad cut you off?
Okay, I bought a boat.
You bought a boat?
Yeah but it wasn't for me, it was for a friend.
Boy did we make friends with the wrong sister!
Jill, honey, I think this is the best thing that could've ever happened to you. I mean you needed to get out on your own anyway! And you know when I did it, I-I-I at first I was scared, and look at me now! I'm the only daughter dad is proud of! Okay, well this is, this is what you're gonna do. You're gonna get a job, you're gonna get an apartment, and then I'll help you and you can stay with us. Right Pheebs, she can stay with us?
Of course, yeah!
Oh, that's so great! Okay, I'm really gonna do this! I don't know how to thank you guys.
Ooh, I like cards.
Are you all finished here?
Yes.
Great!
Okay, here are the tips for this morning. Jen gets 50, 50 for me, and Joey owes eight dollars.
What?!
For all the free food you gave away.
Well if it's free food, how come you're charging me for it?
We don't give anything away unless it's someone's birthday.
Well, what if they came in third in a modeling contest?
No!
Sorry!
I just had the hardest day. Those bags are so heavy.
Jill, how did you pay for all this? I thought your dad took away your credit card.
Oh please, I memorized those numbers when I was 15. But look at all the cool make-it-on-my-own stuff I got! This is my "Please, hire me" sweater. And these are my, "Don't you want to rent me this apartment?" pants.
I don't think charging new clothes too your dad qualifies as making it on your own.
Oh, Mr. Scientist has to get all technical!
Seriously, I don't Rachel's gonna think it's a good idea.
So who made her queen of the world?
I would love that job!
Hey! What's goin' on?
Hey!
Jill! Did you shop?!
No! They did!
Yeah, we went shopping!
You went shopping?! What, and then you just came in here and paraded it right under Jill's nose when you know she's trying to quit. Wow, you guys are terrible!
Sorry Jill.
Sorry-sorry Jill.
What'd you get?
Oh well, all right, I got thank you, I got uh, this y'know "I want a job sweater."
Oh.
And, and then I got uh, these are apartment pants.
Apartment pants?
Yeah, you never heard of them?
No, of course, of course I've heard of them! Ross, what did you get?
Huh? Oh, I got this--this!
A pajmena?
Yeah! Oh, I-I love this babies!
Really?
Ross, wants a pajmena?
It's a rug.
Jill?
I'm sorry Rachel, I'm sorry...
Oh, come on! You think that's gonna work on me?! I invented that!
Right! But, I am sorry.
All right, it's okay. One little setback is okay, just don't let it happen again, all right? Now since daddy paid for all this stuff, I should take it all away. But I'm just gonna take the-the pajmena. And the uh, and the uh pants. Y'know what, I'm just gonna take it all away, 'cause that way you'll just really learn the lesson. Okay? All righty, I'm gonna run a couple of errands and I will see you at dinner.
She took all my stuff.
Yeah. Everything but, the little blue one.
That's the best one! Oh my God, thank you so much!
Well. Hey...
Oh my gosh, that was so lame. Like a pajmena could be a rug!
Oh yeah, how about you and the, "I'm sorry!"
Shut up! I did not sound like that at all!
What about, what about when I said y'know about the apartment pants, how dumb was I?
Were you this cute in high school?
Oh stop.
No you stop!
No, you stop!
You stop!
Okay-okay, why don't I sit here and you'll both stop it!
Okay, so what do you, what do you want to do? Let's do something crazy!
I know, let's rest and drink lots of fluids.
Okay, I'll rest. But y'know if I'm going to bed, then you're coming with me.
That would be impossible to resist if you weren't all drippy here.
Are you saying that you don't wanna get with this?
Yeah, I don't you should say that even when you're healthy.
Come on.
Don't take this personally okay? It's just that I just can't have sex with a sick person.
I'm with you Chandler! I mean I can't have sex with a sick person either, that's disgusting! But I'm not sick! Let me prove it to you. We are two healthy people in the pribe of libe.
That's the thing, see I would like to stay in the pribe of mwha-ah-libe.
Hey!
Hey.
What's up?!
Umm, I think there's something you should maybe know.
Well, it'd better not be about the apartment pants, because I just pitched the idea to my boss at Ralph Lauren and she loved it.
No. No. It's just I was umm, I was with Ross and Jill after you left and umm, I'm pretty sure I saw a little spark between them.
What?!
Yeah I mean it's probably nothing, but I just wanted to warn you that there might be something there.
With Ross and Jill?
Yeah!
With Ross and my sister?
Yeah.
With my sister Jill and my ex-boyfriend Ross?
Yeah.
Oh there is no way.
Okay then.
Oh my God! I can not believe that! I mean I don't really like it when Ross goes out with anyone, but my sister isn't that like incest or something?! Oh my God, and they're gonna have sex! Oh! Oh no what if he marries her too?! Oh this is just terrible, this is just terrible. And I can't stop it! I can't-I don't own Ross! Y'know? And Jill, she should be able to do whatever it is that she wants to do! And oh my God, I can't believe Ross is marrying my little sister, this terrible. Oh my God, this is just the worst thing that could have ever happened to me.
But great news about the apartment pants, huh?
That'll be $3.85.
What do you mean? Yesterday you said I was too pretty to pay for stuff!
It's just I can't because my manager said I... "Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you. Happy birthday dear Annie...
Amy!
"...Amy! Happy birthday to you!"
Hey, that's weird, today's my birthday too!
Yeah, not it here it isn't.
Sorry I'm late, what's up?
Oh hi! Y'know, I just wanted to see if there were any leads on the old job front.
Oh no! But I just walked past three sales and I didn't go in. How strong am I?
That is great. Hey, y'know who doesn't have to job hunt? Ross. He works at the university.
Yeah.
Oh so you know that, you guys talked about that, so you get along, so you think you're gonna go out?
Me go out with Ross?! No! God no! What would make you think that?
I just, Phoebe, said y'know thought she saw something between you guys.
No! I mean he's nice.
Yeah.
He's the kind of guy you're friends with, y'know? But he's not the kind of guy you date. He's the kind of guy you'd date because you did. Me, not so much.
Oh not-not so much. Umm, what-what do you, what do you mean is there something wrong with Ross?
Oh no-no-no, he's just I don't know, he's just a little bookish.
Are-are you saying he's a geek?
You think so too?
No! No I, no Ross is not a geek!
Fine, then let's just say he's not my type.
What handsome is not your type? Smart? Kind? Good kisser? What those things aren't on your list? Ross is a great guy! You would be lucky to be with him!
Well okay, if it means that much to you, then I'll ask him out.
Oh no-no-no, no-no-no, that's not what I meant.
No! Y'know what Rachel? You're right, y'know he has been really nice to me.
Yeah but, he's not your type.
Yeah but maybe that's a good thing. Y'know I'm doing all these different sorts of things, and maybe I should try dating a geek too!
Yeah but, you don't, you don't, you don't want to try to much too fast. Y'know? I mean, you do remember what happened to the little girl that tried to much too fast don't you?
What?
She-she died Jill.
Chandler!
Oh what is it honey, you need some tea? Some soup? Oh-ohhhh!
Calling Dr. Big, Dr. Big to the bed.
Oh Jeez honey, I thought, I thought you were asleep.
How could I be asleep knowing that you were in the next room.
I was asleep. Oh no! No-no honey! Y'know what's sexy? Layers. Layers are sexy. And blankets are sexy. And oh! Hot water bottles are sexy.
Come on, get into bed! I want to prove to you that I'm not sick! I wanna make you feel, as good as I feel.
Would you please get some rest!
I'm fine.
"Happy birthday to you!"
You're paying for that.
What? No-no it's her birthday!
You've sung Happy Birthday to 20 different women today!
But it really...
You are no longer authorized to distribute birthday muffins.
Damnit!
Rach? Hi!
Hi!
Did you tell your sister to ask me out?
Well yeah...
Oh wow! I mean, wow! I mean, I-I-I think she's cute but I-I would never have thought of going out with her, never!
Really?!
Yeah but after you said it was okay, I figured, "Why not?!"
Oh so-so not really never.
I have to say you are a much bigger person than I am. I mean after all we've been through, I just-y'know I wish I had a brother to reciprocate. Hey, if you ever want to go out with Monica, you have my blessing.
Oh-ho, and mine!
Chandler, I think I'm sick.
Really? Struck down in the pribe of libe!
Okay, fine I admit it! I feel terrible! Would you please rub this on my chest?
No-no-no-no-no-no-no, you are not getting me this way.
Come on! I really need your help!
No-no-no-no-no!
Fine, I'll rub it on myself.
Okay.
So you're just, kinda rubbing it on yourself?
Yeah?
It's nice.
Are you kidding me?! Is this; is this turning you on?
Yes!
I can't believe it! What is it? Is it the rubbing or the smell?
It's all very, very good. So you wanna go uh, mix it up?
Not now, I'm sick!
Oh come on you big faker!
What happened to your rule about never sleeping with sick people?
Well that was before all the vaporizing action.
Okay, if you really wanna have sex...
Okay!
Worked like a charm.
Hi!
Hi! Wh-what are you doing here?
This is where Ross and I are meeting for our date. So, what do you think?
Well, I-I don't like it.
Really?!
It's kinda slutty.
It's yours!
Yeah well, I'm-I'm a slut.
Me too.
Hi Jill!
Hey!
Hi .
Rachel.
Rachel! Well, you-you're not at home, you're-you're-you're right here.
Yeah I know, and I bet you thought it would be weird. But it's not!
Okay. So well I'll umm, I'll have her home by midnight.
Why aren't you home yet?!
Is someone there?
Oh yes, it's me! Sorry!
What are you doing here?
Uh, I'm just, I'm just looking out your window. At-at the view. What are you guys doing?
We got some Vap-O-Rub in some places.
Oh, he brought her back to his apartment.
Who? Is that your sister?
Ugh, she is a slut!
God, Ross is on a date with your sister! How weird is that?!
Oh my God, look-look he's taking off her clothes!
He's taking off her coat!
Oh, this is just terrible.
Oh no it's not, no it's not. It's a first date. I'm sure that nothing is gonna...
Oh.
Ho-oh, he's gonna get some! Of the glare from the streetlight out of his apartment. Y'know so umm, he's closed the drapes there so he can have a nice, pleasant conversation with your little sister. Well, I'm off to bed!
Oh, uh, hey Rach. I uh, I was just coming over here to uh... Oh wait, I don't have to lie to you, you don't live here anymore. Uh, I'm eating their food. What are you doing?
Ross is on a date with my sister and they shut the drapes two and a-half-hours ago.
Whoa, I didn't know we could date your sister!
Joey we know you steal our food.
I'm good.
Oh, are the drapes still closed hon?
Yeah. And y'know who should've shut their drapes? Is that perverted old couple two doors over.
Is that a swing?
Oh don't even ask!
Yuck!
I can't believe Ross went out with Rachel's sister! When Chandler made out with my sister I was mad at him for 10 years.
That was like 5 years ago.
Yeah you got 5 years left!
Joey...
You wanna make it 6?!
Oh Ross, hi! Hey, how are ya? There you are!
Hey!
I'll take a coffee. So how was your big date last night?
Uhh, it was okay. Yeah, it was fun.
Yeah fun? Great! So uh, so did you guys hit it off?
I guess so.
So uh, so did anything happen? Because rumor has it you guys shut the drapes!
No. No. Nothing happened. I shut the drapes to uh, show her slides of my favorite fossils.
Oh, slides. So really nothing happened.
Something could've happened. All right? She-she really dug my slides. And-and she was definitely giving me the vibe.
Right. Was it the, "Please don't show me another picture of a trilobite vibe?"
Anyway, if she, if she wasn't in to me, why-why would she ask me out again?
She asked-asked you out again?
Yeah-uh-huh. Tomorrow night, Valentine's Day, the most romantic day of the year. Who knows what could happen? I might not be shutting my drapes to show her my slides, if you know what I mean.
Okay-okay-okay-okay-okay-okay-okay! I got it! I got it! I got it! I can't! I can't! I can't! I cannot go with you and my sister thing. Okay? I just can't. It's just too weird, all right? I imagine the two of you together and I freak out. It freaks me out. I can't do it! I can't do it.
Okay! Okay! Okay! It's okay. It's okay. Hey, it's too weird for you, I won't see her again.
Thank you. I...yeah.
I mean after tomorrow night.
No-no-no! No-no-no! Please Ross, I can't! I can't do it! It's just gonna freak me out!!!
Okay! Okay! Ooh-hey-hey-hey! Okay! Okay! Okay! I'll-I'll tell her tonight I can't see her anymore.
Ross thanks.
You want me to call her right now?
Oh no! No! No-no-no-no! No, I mean come on that's-that's crazy-I mean that's crazy. So what's-what's going on with you? What is going on with you?
Well umm, oh! I might be teaching another class this semester!
Yeah do it now, call right now.
This is my favorite part.
Yeah me too.
Oh y'know what's sadder than this? Bambi. I cried for three days with that movie. No wait two! Because on the third day my mother killed herself so I was partly crying for that.
Well see now that I can see crying over, but Bambi is a cartoon!
You didn't cry when Bambi's mother died?
Yes it was very sad when the guy stopped drawing the deer!
Chandler there's nothing wrong with crying! I mean you don't have to be so macho all the time.
I'm not macho.
Yeah you're right. I don't know what I was thinking.
No, I guess I just never really cried. Y'know? I'm not a crying kind of guy.
Come on man there's gotta be something that gets you choked up! Like uh, uh oh, what if you saw a three-legged puppy?
I'd be sad sure, but I wouldn't cry.
Okay, what if the puppy said, "Help me Chandler. All the other puppies pick on me."
Cry?! I just found a talking puppy, I'm rich!
Oh, I've got it! I have got it! Pictures from your childhood. This will get you going good!
All right, what's going on there?
Oh, that's Parent's Day, first grade. That's me with the janitor Martin.
Where were your parents?
Oh they didn't want to come!
Oh Chandler!
Poor thing!
So that story doesn't make you cry?
No! Look, I don't cry! It's not a big deal! Okay?!
No! It's not okay! It's not okay at all!! You're dead inside!!
Excuse me.
Yeah?
Are you Phoebe Buffay?
Yeah.
Can-can I get your autograph, I'm your biggest fan.
Oh you're my biggest fan? I've always wanted to meet you! Hi! Sure! Yeah!
Wow! Wow, thanks a lot! I just wanna say, I think you're really talented.
You're just saying that because you're my biggest fan. Joey listen, take good care of that guy, okay? He's a fan. Bye!
So, you saw me on Days Of Our Lives huh? Want me to, want me to do a little Dr. Drake Remoray for ya?
I have no idea what you're talking about. But I, but I just got Phoebe Buffay's autograph!
Oh, you're Phoebe's fan!
Oh yeah! I've seen all her movies.
Movies?
That was Phoebe Buffay, the porn star.
I don't think so.
No-no, it was! She was in Sex Toy Story 2, Lawrence of Alabia, and I got her autograph! The guys at the comic book store aren't gonna believe this!
Hey Gunther, don't let that guy in here anymore! He just said Phoebe's a porn star!
Well, I wouldn't call her a star, but she's really good. You should check out Inspecther Gadget.
Hey!
Hey!
You'll never believe what just happened, Ross just totally blew me off and he didn't even tell me why!
Ohhh well. Y'know what honey? The best thing to do to get over a guy is to start dating someone else. Oh! There is this great guy you will love at work named Bob! He's a real up-and-comer in Human Resources.
Y'know, thanks for trying to cheer me up, but I'm not gonna date some random guy from your work.
It's not random, it's Bob.
It's probably because not mature enough. Or smart enough. Maybe he doesn't like the way I dress-No that can't be it. It's really gotta be the smart thing. Oh I'm so stupid! I'm just like this incredibly pretty stupid girl!
No honey, okay, okay, you wanna know why Ross canceled the date? Because I asked him to.
You asked him too?!
Hm-mmm.
Why?!
Because you are my sister and Ross and I have this huge history...
I don't understand, do you want to go out with Ross?
No.
You don't want him, but you don't want me to have him?
Y'know Bob in Human Resources...
Ugh! I cannot believe you did this too me! You had me doubting how smart I was! You had me doubting my fashion sense!
Look, this is not that big of a deal! You just don't date Ross! There's a million other guys out there, you just...
Hey! You have no right to tell me what to do.
I'm not telling you what to do! I am telling you what not to do!
Why are you so jealous of me?
Jill this is not about me being jealous of you! This is about you being a brat! Wanting what you can't have!
Can't have?! Excuse me, the only thing I can't have is dairy!
All right, all right, well you just blew your chances at dating Bob!
Who?!
In Human Resources!!!!!!
...I am jealous of her?! I mean who does she think she is?! Princess Caroline?!
You're jealous of Princess Caroline?
Do I have my own castle?
Hey! Uh, Phoebe's not here is she?
No.
Oh great! Did you get a movie?
Uhhh, yeah. Yeah. But uh, I don't think it's the kind you're gonna like.
You didn't get more movies that are gonna have us reaching for the tissues all night did you?
Sort of...
Guys, what's going on?
Phoebe's a porn star!
What?!!
Phoebe Buffay In Buffay The Vampire Layer.
Oh my God!
That's Phoebe! Where did you get that?
Well down at the adult video place down on Bleaker.
And-and I, and I saw that Joey was about to go in, so I ran in ahead of him to-to surprise him and, and then I pretended I didn't know he was in there.
Wow! I mean, I just-I can't, I can't believe this. Y'know, I mean you think you know someone even, even Phoebe who's always been somewhat of a question mark.
This is so bizarre. I guess it kinda makes sense though, y'know she had such a terrible childhood.
Hey, I had a terrible childhood and I don't do porn.
Yes, but you are dead inside.
All right well, I'd better take that back.
Wh-what, why?
We can't watch that! I mean that's Phoebe!
Yeah you're right, we can't-we shouldn't watch this.
Absolutely not.
Y'know maybe a little bit!
Probably just the first half.
No! Hey no! This is wrong you guys! Phoebe's our friend! Well, I'm not gonna watch it!
Yeah! Good for you Joe!
Yeah.
Ah, I thought I'd find you here, Nasforatool.
Buffay, are you going to plunge your stake into my dark places?
Actually, I was kinda hoping it would be the other way around.
Hold on a second! What is that on her ankle?
Her ankle is what you're watching?
Well it's hard to tell... Oh God, if she would just stop moving.
She's just doing her job!
You sick bastards!
Oh, it's a tattoo! That's weird, Phoebe doesn't... Wait that's Ursula! That's not Phoebe that is Ursula!
Re! Re! Then I can watch that! Rewind it! Rewind it!
Hey! What's up? Oh my God! What am I doing?!!
Hey sweetie!
Hey!
Chicken Soup for the Soul?
There's no back to this couch!
Why are you reading this? You hate this kind of stuff.
Yeah I know, but I figured a shot y'know? Maybe one of those stories would make me cry and then you wouldn't think I was y'know, all dead inside.
Oh that's so sweet! Look Chandler I don't care if you can't cry, I love you.
Oh that makes me feel so warm in my hollow tin chest.
Stop it!
No, I mean, come on, seriously think about it, we get married, we're up at the altar and I'm like this.
I won't care, because I know you will be feeling it all in here.
Yeah?
Yeah! And if, and if we have a baby one-day, and the doctor hands it to you in the delivery room and you don't cry, so what! And-and-and, and if we take him to college and come home and see his empty room for the first time, and you got nothing, it won't matter to me.
Okay, well I won't uh, worry about this anymore then.
And-and-and if I die, from a long illness. And you're writing out my eulogy and you open a desk drawer and you find a note from me that says, "I will always be with you," and you still can't shed one tiny tear, I know you'll be crying a river inside.
Aww, I love you so...
What is wrong with you?!!!
What?!
What?! You can't shed a tear for your dead wife!! Now, I left you a note from the beyond!
So you didn't mean any of that?!
No you robot!!
You damn kids! You ring my bell one more time, I swear to... Ohh, uh Jill. Umm, that-that's just a little game I play with the kids down the hall. Umm, they've really taken a liking to me. Uhh what's-what's-what's the matter?
Rachel and I had a really big fight, can I come in? I-I mean I know we're not supposed to see each other anymore and I'm okay with that, it's just that I don't know anybody in the city and I really need somebody to talk to about it.
Of course, what happened?
I don't want to talk about it.
Okay, umm...
But you know what might really cheer me up?
What?
Seeing some more of your super-cool slides.
Wow! Really?!
Totally, I love them! And, maybe you could finish telling me about all the different kinds of sand.
Well, I'd love to! Here, you wait right here and I'll go get the projector and my notes!
Oh great! Thanks Ross, you're such a good friend!
Ohh!
Hey! Have you guys seen Jill? I can't find her anywhere.
No, I haven't.
Well, is Ross home? Maybe I'll just call him to see if he's actually seen her.
Who is it?
It's Phoebe! Phoebe!
Hey!
Oh God. So-so you're making porn movies.
No I'm not.
We're still rolling!
You're making one right now!
Let's go Phoebe!
And-and you're using my name!
Yeah, can I help you with something?
Phoebe, come on!
Look, I'm talking right now! You're-you mean her.
Y'know, twin stuff is always a real big seller.
What?!
Yeah, I can talk them into giving you like, 30 dollars.
No!! No way! No! And stop using my name! And shame on you! And shame on all of you! You're disgusting! Especially you with that!
Slides are almost ready.
Yeah. Ooh, I know what this is missing! Alcohol!
Uh okay, well there's-there's wine in the kitchen.
Oh great!
Hello?
What is my sister doing there?! And why are the drapes shut?!
O-okay, Rach calm-calm down, okay? She-she's really upset we're just talking.
Ross! I think she is trying to make something happen with you to get back at me!
So that's the only reason she could be here huh? It couldn't have anything to do with the fact that-that maybe I'm a good listener and I uh I put on a great slide show!
Ross, I am telling you that she is using you to get back at me!
Y'know what? I think I can take care of myself, I'll talk to you later. Good-bye. Whoa! Uh, that was your sister actually. She-she thinks that you're just using me.
So?
Hey!
Hey!
So, I just came from the company Ursula works for.
Oh no, not you too!
No! No! I just went to pick up Phoebe Buffay's checks; there were a lot of them.
Nice!
Um-mmm, and I won't have to go there anymore because I gave them my correct address.
That's great, but isn't it gonna bother that people still think you're a porn star?
Oh no! No! I know how to handle it.
You do?
Yeah. You're trying to figure out where you know me from? All right, I'll give you a hint. From porn! Okay? Yeah your pervert boyfriend watched me in a porno movie! See?
Yeah.
Hey.
You uh, you may have been right about Jill.
Oh! I knew it! What happened?
Umm, she kissed me.
What?! You kissed!
Maybe we should give them some privacy.
Shhhh!!!
Look, I uh, I tried not to kiss her, okay?
Well, it doesn't sound like it! I mean, it's pretty easy not to kiss someone, you just don't kiss them! See look at us, right now, not kissing!
Let me finish, okay? She started kissing me and-and I didn't stop it. I guess I-I just wasn't thinking...
Yeah that's right you weren't thinking! Y'know what? Let me give you something to think about!
Oh wait-hold it! But then I started thinking and I stopped the kissing.
Oh, well thank you for taking your tongue out of my sister's mouth long enough to tell me that.
Look I-I realize if anything were to happen with me and Jill then nothing could ever happen with us!
What?!
No, I mean, look I don't know if anything is going to happen with us, again. Ever. But I don't want to know that it-it never could. So I stopped it and she got mad and broke my projector.
Wow. I, I don't even know what to say. Thank you.
You're welcome.
Oh my God! Are-are you crying?
I just don't see why those two can't work things out!
All right, I'm leaving! Because I'm not going to spend one more day with someone whose out to sabotage my every move. That's you Rachel!
Yeah, I got that.
And you! I throw myself at you and you say no, how gay are you?
You take care Jill.
Okay, see ya!
Bye-bye-e!
Bye.
I-I can't believe Jill's gone. I can't help it, I opened a gate.
Hey, you guys! Guess what? Barry and Mindy are getting a divorce!
Oh my God!
Wow!
What is the matter with you?!
No! Barry and Mindy.
Oh sorry, I hear divorce I immediately go to Ross. Who-who's Barry and Mindy?
Barry was the guy that I was almost married and Mindy was my best friend.
Ohh-oh, wasn't he cheating on you with her?
Yeah, but that just means that he was falling asleep on top of her instead of me.
Why did they get divorced?
Well, apparently she caught him cheating on her with someone else. Isn't that sad? God, could you imagine if I actually married him?! I mean how different would my life be?
I know what you mean, I've always wondered how different my life would be if-if I'd never gotten divorced.
Which time?
The first time! No seriously, imagine if Carol hadn't realized she was a lesbian.
I can't. I keep seeing it the good way.
I'd bet I'd still be doing my kara-tay. Towards the end of our marriage I was doing a lot of kara-tay as a way of releasing the tension from y'know, not doing anything else physical.
Maybe the problem was you were pronouncing it kara-tay.
And what if I was still fat? Well, you wouldn't be dating me, that's for sure.
Sure I would!
Oh yeah! Come on! Yeah right!
What, you guys really think that I'm that shallow?
No, I just think Monica was that fat.
Hey, imagine if I never got fired off Days Of Our Lives! Oh-hey, there's Carol again!
What if I had had the guts to quit my job? I'd probably be writing for the New Yorker, getting paid to be funny. But my job's fun too! I mean tomorrow, I-I don't have to wear a tie.
What if I had taken that job at Merrill Lynch?
What?!
Merrill Lynch?
Yeah, I had a massage client who worked there and-and he said I had a knack for stocks.
Well why didn't you take the job?
Because at that time you see, I thought everything that rhymed was true. So I thought y'know that if I'd work with stocks, I'd have to live in a box, and only eat lox, and have a pet fox.
Hey, do you guys think that if all those things happened, we'd still hang out?
Oh my God! Rachel Green?
Rob Tillman!
No-no. It's-it's me, Ross!
Oh, I'm sorry. Ross Tillman.
No, no-no, Ross Geller.
Ohh, of course Monica's brother!
Yeah. Right.
Wow! How are you?!
Good-good, I'm-I'm married.
Ohh! Me too!
Is-isn't it the best?
Oh, it's the best! So, umm how's Monica?
Oh really, really great! Yeah! A-actually she's right down the street, umm, do-do you know what? You should stop bye and say hi.
Ohh, I would love too.
Yeah? Oh-oh, she'd be so excited!
Ohh! Okay!
Come on!
Oh wait, don't you have to pay for your, Busty Ladies?
No, it's okay. Some-some kid asked me to pick it up for him, but I don't...
Oh yeah? Okay.
Okay.
But! Don't you have to give him his money back?
Uh-huh. Hey, here you go buddy. Sorry, no porn for you. Okay, let's go see Monica!
So Monica, still going out with Dr. Boring huh?
He's not boring! He's just-he's just low key.
Here we go, one Hazelnut Latte.
Thanks.
Yeah. Y'know, the hazelnut actually not a nut, it's a seed.
Wow!!
Can anyone else name a well known seed that's been masquerading as a nut?
Oh dear God, let me think.
Hey.
Hey.
Oh no! What's the matter?
Oh I just got another rejection letter. They said my writing was funny, just not "Archie Comic funny."
Y'know what honey? I got to get back to the hospital.
Okay.
Okay.
Bye.
Bye-bye. Oh uh, by the way, the answer is, the Brazil nut.
Was his question what's more boring than him?
Hey man, look sorry about that Archie thing. Do uh, do you need me to give you some money?
Hey, I may have no money, but I still have my pride.
Really?
Ehh.
Maybe Joey doesn't have to give you the money, TV stars have assistants right?
That's an idea! Hey, if I hired an assistant, would-would you take money from her?
No Joey! Chandler could be your assistant! See, he could answer all of your fan mail and stuff!
That's great! That would be great! Let's do that!
I could use the money; it could give me time to write.
Oh right great! Welcome aboard!
Okay!
All right! Now hey, I need to use the bathroom. Since I don't need any assistance in there, take a break!
All right!
Hey!
Hey Phoebe! Guess what?
What?
Joey just hired Chandler to be his assistant!
Ohh that's so sweet! Oh! Hang on! Hang onnnnnn!!! Go!! No! No-no! I said sell when it hits 50! 5-0, it's a number! It comes after 4-9!! No, it's okay. It's okay, you're allowed one mistake. Just kidding, you are of course fired.
Hey Mon!
Hey!
Mon, look who I ran into!
Oh my God! Rachel!! You look terrific!
Ohh, so do you! Did you lose weight?
You are so sweet to notice! Yes, I lost three and a half pounds!
And, and uh, you-you remember my friend Chandler.
Hey.
Oh yeah.
And that's Phoebe over there!
Hi!
Oh my God, sit down! Sit down! How long as it been since we've seen each other?
1987, the day after Christmas, at Sean McMahon's party. I played you one of my songs, y'know Interplanetary Courtship Ritual.
Oh yeah. Right. So now, are-do you, do you still do music?
Sometimes, you should come over sometime! I'll play you one of my other...
Oh my God! Joey Tribbiani from Days of Our Lives, just walked in here!
Rach, he's a friend of ours.
You are friends with Dr. Drake Remoray?
Well it's kinda hard to be friends with Drake because of his busy schedule and the fact that he's not real.
Hey-hey, or I could bring my keyboard over here sometime!
He's coming over! He's coming over!
Joey!
I know, here-here!!
Ohhh! No! This is my friend Rachel, we went to High School together.
Hi!
Hi!
Hi! I love you on that show! I watch you everyday! I mean, when you took out your own kidney to save your ex-wife even though she tired to kill you...
Well, it's always nice to meet the fans.
Ah!
She's not crazy is she?
No.
So uh, how you doin'?
Hang on! Hang on! Hang on! Go!! Who's this? Oh okay, you're gonna like working for me. What's your name? What kind of name is Brendy? I... Whatever... Stop talking! All right, from now on your name is Joan. You can pick your own last name.
Hey there you are!
Uh-oh, it's my boss!
All right, here's a list of things for you to do today. Man, this going to be so great! Thank you so much! All right, I got to go to work I'm delivering twins today, but only one of them is mine!
Drop off my dry cleaning. Pick up my vitamins. Teach me how to spell vitamins. Wear in my new jeans.
You realize what you are don't you?
What?
You're his bitch.
No-no!! No!!
Oh wait! You didn't just sit on my Kit-Kats did you?!!
No! There-there was a little, a little diff in the market and I lost 13 million dollars.
But the Kit-Kats are all right?!
What am I gonna do?! What am I gonna do?! I can't call my office they'll kill me! I can't call my clients they'll kill themselves! Great, now my chest hearts.
What?!
My chest hurts! Oh, and now I-I can't breathe.
Phoebe, are you having a heart attack?!
Oh, if I were, would-would I have shooting pains up and down my left arm?
Yes!!
Then yes that is what I'm having.
Oh my God!
Come on Pheebs, it's not that bad! Y'know most people would be excited if they didn't have to work for a couple of weeks.
Most people don't like their jobs, I love my job! I have not been working for three hours and I'm already going crazy. I miss Joan.
Honey, having a heart attack is nature's way of telling you to slow it down.
I always thought having a heart attack was nature's way of telling you to die! But you're not gonna die. I mean, you are going to die, but you're not gonna die today. I wish I was dead.
Let's take a walk. Y'know maybe you should consider writing for Talking Out of Your Ass magazine!
So what's going on with you?
Well umm, I've been doing a lot more of my kara-tay.
Still going through that dry spell with Carol?
Yeah.
How long has it been since you had sex?
Well, last weekend...
Oh that's not so bad.
...will be two months...
That is.
...since I stopped trying.
Maybe you need to spice things up a little.
What-what do you mean?
I don't know. You could tie her up, she could tie you up; you could eat stuff off each other...
Oh.
Y'know, dirty talk, mnage trois, toys...
Wow!
Roll playing... You could be the warden; she could be the prisoner. You could be the pirate; she could be the wench!
Okay, I think I got it.
Yeah! Or too, you could be two stockbrokers and you're-you're-you're rolling around naked on the trading floor and everybody's watching! It never happened.
Sorry. So how's it going with Joey?
Oh just great. He beeps me now with codes. One is, "Bring me food." Two is, "I'm with a girl, bring us food." Three is, "I'm lost and I can't find food."
Hey! Is uh, is she gonna be all right?
Yeah! She's right in there!
Oh great. Hey! Go take off those pants, they look ready!
All right, and over there is Brady's Pub where I like to unwind after a long day of surgeoning.
Wow! This is so amazing! What else? What else?
Well, that is a large piece of television equipment. And uh that is an old man! Hey old man!
Hey!
All righty, what do you say we head back to my place?
Wow! Umm, y'know, I-I would really love to, but I-I shouldn't.
Why? Why can't the world stop turning, just for a moment? Just for us?
Isn't that a line from the show?!
Uh, yeah but uh, I may have said those things before but, I never truly meant them. Until now.
That's a line from the show too!
Okay, you watch too much TV.
Here you go Joe, here's the freshly squeezed orange juice you asked for.
Thanks! Yeah, there's pulp in that.
Yeah?
I thought we talked about this. I don't like pulp. No pulp. Pulp isn't juice. All juice, okay?
I'm sorry, I guess I just like the pulp.
Oh my God, I'm sorry, I'm being so rude. Rachel, would like a soda or something? Because Chandler would run right out and get it.
Yeah sure, iced tea would be great.
Iced tea.
Okay, anything for you sir?
Did I not just tell him?
Yes, you did.
Okay look, Chandler, if this you have got to listen! You're gonna throw that juice at me, aren't ya?
It's not all juice!
So honey, this morning was fun, huh? Me hopping in on you in the shower there.
Yeah! And maybe someday we could get a place with two bathrooms.
Look Carol umm, I was, I was thinking maybe uh, maybe we can spice things up a little.
What do you mean?
Carol our sex life is-it's just not working...
Dad!!
Hey there little fella! Hey, uh-hey, why don't we get some shoes on ya, huh? Hey, why don't you show dad how you can put your shoes on, in your room! Yay!!
Yay!
Yay! Seriously, our sex life... I was thinking, maybe I don't know, we could try some-some new things. Y'know? For fun?
Like what?
Well I don't know umm, what if we were too tie each other up? Umm, some people eat stuff off one another. Nah! Umm, y'know we-we could try dirty talk? Umm, we could, we could have a threesome.
I love that idea!
Who sold a story to Archie Comics?!
Oh my God! That's great! Oh wow! You're a published writer! I wish I had a present for you!
Aww.
Wait a minute! My last Kit-Kat bar!
You wanna share it?
Okay!!
Hey! Hey Chandler look, I know you're mad, but I just want to say I'm sorry. I-I was a total jerk. Completely o-over the line. Uh, I just I hate pulp! Y'know? I mean, y'know how Monica feels about low fat mayonnaise?
It's not mayonnaise!!
Yeah, o-o-o-o-okay anyway, I just wanted to say I'm sorry. Here.
What's this?
Fresh squeezed orange juice, with pulp! Just the way you like it.
Aww, thanks man.
Hey Joey, Chandler sold a story to Archie Comics!
Oh my God! That's great! Congratulations! What's the story?!
Oh you wouldn't uh, care. It's just a stupid comic book story.
Are you kidding me?! I love Archie! And the whole gang!
Well uh, Archie needs money to fix his jalopy , uh but he doesn't want Reggie to just give him the money. So Reggie hires him as his assist-as his butler. And then makes him do all these crazy things like bring him milkshakes that can't have lumps in them.
Wait a minute. That sounds a little familiar! Did they already do that one? 'Cause I think I read it!
Oh Mon, listen I have to ask! Okay, Joey Tribbiani invited me back to his apartment, now does he do this with a lot of girls?
Yeah, a lot. A lot, a lot!
Ohh! And I'm one of them!! Wow! Oh, I just cannot believe this! I mean, Joey Tribbiani!
Well, y'know it's none of my business, but aren't you married?
Yeah. Oh I just wish we could not be married for a little bit! Y'know I just wish we could be like on a break!
Well, you're not.
Oh, it's so easy for you I mean, you're not married, you get to have sex with who ever you want!
Yeah I can! And don't think I don't, because I do! I mean all the time, you betcha!
Monica. You've, you've done it right?
Of course I have! What do you think, I'm some 30 year old virgin?
Oh my God! You're a 30 year old virgin!
Say it louder, I don't think the guy all the way in the back heard you!
Yeah, I heard it.
It's not like, I haven't any opportunities. I mean, y'know, I'm just waiting for the perfect guy. I'm seeing this guy Roger, all right? He's not perfect, but umm, I think maybe I should just get it over with. Y'know, give him my flower.
Oh my God!! Do it!! Honey, you've waited long enough!!
Y'know what? You are right?!
Yes!! I mean sex does not have to be a big deal! There shouldn't be all this rules and restrictions! Y'know, people should be able to sleep with who ever they want, whenever...
Rachel! I'm never gonna think it's okay for you to cheat on your husband!
Oh what do you know? Virgin!
Phoebe, why is smoke coming out of the bathroom?!
Oh yeah, the doctor said that could be one of the side effects.
Phoebe! Put that cigarette out!
No! It's not a cigarette! The smoke is coming out of me!
Put it out!!
Okay! Okay! I'm so glad you're here.
Come on. I got it.
Oh, give it to me.
I got it!
Give it!
Hello? No she can't come to the phone right now. Oh, right no problem. Okay, bye-bye.
Was it my work? Were they mad? Was it Jack? Did he yell?!
J-j-just relax, nobody yelled. Jack just was calling to make sure that you were getting better.
Thank God.
Yeah, she's fired.
You've done all you can Dr. Wesley. You have got to let her go.
Good-bye and God speed, Hope Brady.
Not so fast Wesley!
Remoray!
That's right Wesley! I just stopped by to say that, you're not a real doctor! And that woman's brain, is fine!
Oh! Thank God!
Hope! Hope!
Drake!
You're not dying Hope, you're gonna live a long, healthy life. With me.
Oh Drake.
Okay! Here we go! Okay! Hi, Joey! It's Rachel! Umm, I am free tomorrow night. Yeah, sure, sure I can bring some sandwiches.
So honey this uh, this threesome thing umm, I mean how-how are you gonna start to find...
Ooh, actually I've been making a list of all the women I know who might be into doing this!
Oh. Wow! Huh. Boy! Well, someone's been doing their homework.
Yeah. Ooh, and I know Gail Rosten is in there twice, but she is so...
Oh, I know. Y'know, just-just talking about it is getting me kinda...
Oh, me too.
Yeah? Well, I-I think Ben's asleep.
Oh umm, y'know I think it would be better if we just save it.
Yeah. Right. Save it. I can do that.
Hey, Pheebs!
Hey.
Hey, how's it going?
Well, I've got to get out of this bed, I'm going crazy here. Crazy!
Here you go sweetie.
What the hell is this, herbal tea? I hate herbal tea!
But, I put some honey in it.
She doesn't know she was fired yet, does she?
No, the doctors say it may kill her.
What are you two girls whispering about over there?!
But I think we should tell her.
Hey Pheebs, maybe this whole heart attack thing is a sign, that-that you should start think about getting a different job.
Okay, what is this? A stupid contest? Because we got a winner here!
Listen Phoebe, he's right. People are not supposed to have heart attacks at 31.
I know! But if I didn't work there, what else would I do?
Well, you used to like playing the guitar.
Yeah that was lucrative! Smart like your brother!
Uh, what about y'know the massage thing? That never gave you a heart attack.
Hmm, pulling in a salary in the high six figures or rubbing gross naked people for chump change-ooh, what do I do?! What will I do?!
Ohh, I mean it's just so realistic!
I know. Yeah, his name is Pat.
Pat the dog. Oh! Oh! I get it!!
Do you uh, do you-ready for a refill?
Oh, I probably shouldn't-so I will! Oh! Wow! It's like it's raining!
Pretty cool, huh? But if you're thinking you can put a fish in there and it wouldn't get sucked up into the mechanism, well you'd be wrong.
Umm, can I use your bathroom?
It's uh, right through there.
Okay. God y'know, if someone told me a week ago that I would be peeing in Joey Tribbiani's apartment...
Yeah, life's pretty great isn't it?
Yeah, it sure is!
I hope you're hungry, we're starting with oysters. And y'know what they say about oysters, don't you?
They have parasites?
No! Umm well, some people say that Oysters are an aphrodisiac.
What people?
People! People say it! Come here!
So oysters, huh?
And then we're gonna have a little Middle Eastern cous-cous. Something we can eat, with our hands.
Y'know, it's funny, but when we were studying communicable diseases...
No-no-no, no! It's sensual!
Ohh! Didn't know! Okay!
Okay! Ohhh no!
I'm sorry sweetie, it's the hospital. The food looks great, maybe save me some?
I can't promise anything.
We're really gonna do this, huh?
Looks like it.
Y'know, if, if this is too weird for you, we can still back out at...
I got it!
Okay.
Susan! Hi!
Hey!
Thank you so much for coming.
Oh, I wouldn't miss it for the world.
I'm-I'm Ross by the way.
Hello Ross. I love what you've done with this space.
Thank you so much.
How hot is this?!
I'm sorry you're here with me instead of Roger.
Yeah, me too.
Well, I could make it seem like he's here. "Here's some little known facts about cous-cous. They didn't add the second cous until 1979."
Stop it!! That's not funny!!
Okay.
I'm sorry, okay? It just-tonight was supposed to be y'know, it was supposed to be a big deal.
What was tonight?
You don't want to know what tonight was.
Okay. What was tonight?
Well, tonight was-was going to be my first time.
With Roger? Not just with Roger?! Oh my God!
All right relax Mr. I've Had Sex Four Times!
Four different women! I've had sex way more times!
How many?
Nine.
I was just waiting for the perfect guy.
Well good, good for you. You really think that Roger is the perfect guy?
No. He's not a horrible guy.
Hey that's what I tell girls about me.
Chandler, I'm gonna die a virgin!
No you are not! You are sweet and wonderful and this is gonna happen for you.
Oh really? When? Do you wanna do it with me?
Okay.
I was kidding.
So was I.
Joey, you're such an amazing actor! How do you know where Dr. Drake Remoray leaves off and Joey Tribbiani begins?
Well, with Dr. Drake they always tell me what to say. And with Joey, I pretty much have to make it up on my own.
Wow! Tell me something Joey--Whoa! I just fell right off the couch there.
Yeah you did.
Okay.
Here you go. Let me ask you a question.
Yeah?
When was the last time someone told you just how beautiful you are?
Wow! I can't, I can't feel my hands.
Come, come here.
We can't do this.
No! Oyster?
Yeah! If-if-if we did do this there would be a lot of pressure on me, y'know? Because you've been waiting a very long time and I wouldn't want to disappoint you.
Yeah but see I have nothing to compare it too. So even if you're horrible, how would I know?
I do like that.
It's harder for me! I have those four other women to compete with!
Well, if it helps there were only three. So it would just be for tonight, right?
Absolutely! It would just be one friend helping out another friend.
Stop it! We're doing this! Let's do it!
Noo!! Okay!!
Okay!
Umm, do you have any uhh, moves?
I have some moves.
I have no moves. Okay, whatcha doin' there?! Oh y'know what? I'm sorry, this is just too weird.
Yeah, let's just forget it.
What if I turn out the lights?
Okay!
Oh yeah.
Chandler?
Yeah?
That's the couch.
Oh my God!
I know! I'll tell you something, we are gonna do that again!
Oh, okay!
Morning!
Oh right.
Yeah.
Oh God. Oh I can't believe Joey Tribbiani heard me throw up!
Well he actually saw you a little bit too.
Noo! Oh God we did-we didn't, we didn't uhh...
No! No! No, not after seeing that.
God I'm just a horrible person.
Wh-why?
Because I'm married. That's right, I am a married woman! And I came to a TV star's apartment to have an affair! Uck!
That's ridiculous! I'm not a "Star," just a regular famous actor.
Yeah and I'm a horrible, horrible person.
Rachel, would you stop saying that?! Hey-hey look, remember on the show when-when Caprice was dying and she gave me...
The ring from the cave, yeah.
Wow! Uh okay, well uh...
Oh my God, they let you keep that stuff?!
Sure! As long as they don't find out you can keep whatever you want! And I want you to have it.
No! No-no-no...
Yes! Yes!! And every time you look at it, I want you to remember that you are a good person. Okay, you've had the chance to cheat, and with me, but you didn't. And that's what this ring stands for.
But I thought that ring stood for Caprice's undying love for her brother.
Look, do you want the ring or not?!
Yeah!
Hey!
Hey!
Look at you! You're up!
All right!
I thought I'd try to take a walk. Would you pour me some water? I'll be back soon.
Whoa-whoa-whoa! You're not gonna use the pay phone to call work, are ya?
No. I've learned my lesson.
Let's go! Come on! Move it! Come on! Shoes! Briefcase! Thanks Lou, good luck with the gall bladder.
Hey Joe did... Did you ever have a threesome?
Well uh, look Ross I uh, I think Carol's great and I'm sure you're a very attractive man, but I....
No! The reason I'm asking is that... I sorta had one last night.
You?
Yeah!
Wow!
Yeah!
All right! So, was it amazing?
It was, it was okay.
Just okay-Did you do it right?!
Look, it's just did, did you ever go to a party and think, "Would really anyone miss me if I weren't here?"
Huh. But still Ross, you're worst day with two women, pretty much better than any other day! Y'know what I mean?
Oh-oh, absolutely!
It's just, my part seemed to be over pretty quickly and then, and then there was a lot of waiting around.
But you got to be with both of them, right?
Not-not really. Th-th-there was just Carol.
Not the other one?
No, she kept kicking me away!
Yeah, you don't want that.
No!
Well hey, at least you got to see a lot of stuff, right?
Oh I a lot of stuff!
You got a little bored?
A little. Yeah. I made a snack.
Yeah? What did ya have?
Just a sandwich. Turkey, a little mustard...
Sounds good.
It really was!
Hey!
Hey!
Let me tell you about this chick I scored with last night! Oh no wait a minute that was you!
Hey, check me out, I'm a slut!
So you uh, want to do something tonight?
Oh I can't. Dr. Roger is coming over again.
Oh. Oh right! Right! Because you're still seeing him and uh, he's a good guy. I mean, I remember a time when...
Are you okay?
Yeah! Totally! Totally, and you?
Great! It's so amazing! I mean, last time Dr. Roger came over, I was so nervous, but then after being with you I'm all like, "Can the doctor see me now?"
I bet he can.
Y'know, I don't have an appointment, but I sure could use a physical. Are you sure you're okay?
Oh yeah! Yeah! Don't worry about me, I'll be fine!
Ohh! My God! Barry!!
You-you-you said you were gonna be away all weekend!
Oh that's right! I'm sorry! I-I am early! Finish! Please!!
Surprise! Look who's back!
Hey Pheebs!
Hey!
Call security. Pheebs, didn't you get fired?
Uh, I don't think so!
Phoebe?
Jack!! Hey!
What are you doing here?
All better! Back to work! Except this clown from research told me I was fired. He should do his research, huh?
Well, you were fired.
Nu-uh!
I told that guy who answered your phone.
Oh, okay I didn't get that message. So this doesn't count-Anyway, I'll be in my office.
Uh, Phoebe you-you don't have an office.
That's all right, I'll work here. This is goo, next to this plant.
Phoebe, listen...
You're in my office! Look, I have made a lot of cash for this company! Okay? I am talking big bucks! Pesos! Yen! Rubles! You make one little mistake...
You lost 13 million dollars.
Oh, so this is all about money! Y'know it's bad enough that-Ow! Oh, you have got to be kidding!
Are you all right?
I'm having another heart attack!
What?!
I'm having another heart attack!! Call 9-1-1!!
Take it easy.
Dumbass!
Hey Pheebs! How's it going?!
Well, they fired me and I'm having heart attack.
Wow! Well, welcome back!
Yeah.
Hi Ross!
Hey Rachel.
Is Joey Tribbiani here?
Umm, no.
Well, if you see him, will you please tell him that I'm looking for him and that this I am not gonna throw up!
That-that's always good news. Are you okay?
Me? I'm great! I'm fine! I'm sooo good!! But, you know who's not great?! Men! You're a man right Ross?!
Yeah.
Sit down!
Okay.
Let me uh, let me ask you something, do wedding vows mean squat to you people?! And why is it that the second we tell you we're going out of town, bamn there you are in bed with the neighbor's dog walker?!
We're sorry.
No seriously! Seriously! What has happened to the sanctity of marriage?
Didn't you spend last night at Joey's?
Aw what are you?! A detective?
Look I-I don't know what's going on with you and your husband and what is hopefully an adult dog walker, look can I just say not all men are like that.
Oh.
Hey! There are some men who will do whatever it takes to make their marriage work! Okay? There are some men who will stand by and-and watch as their wives engage in-in what only can be described as a twosome with some-some woman she barely knows from the gym!
Who are these men?
Men. I guy I know.
Well, you might want to tell him it sounds like his wife is gay.
She is not... She's gay. Oh my God. She is so gay! I can't believe this.
Good day for married people huh?
I'm sorry your husband cheated on you.
I'm sorry your wife is gay. I guess women aren't that great either.
Try telling my wife that.
Okay to come in?
Yeah, come on, eat, whatever you want. Dr. Roger got beeped again.
Yeah I know, guess who beeped him?
What?!
I'm the ruptured spleen.
Why would you do that?
Because you shouldn't be with him. You should be with me.
Really?
Yeah! When you were talking about Roger, that was killing me! Look, things like last night they don't just happen. Y'know? Or at least not to me. Or with the other two women, in the morning y'know I was just lying there and I couldn't wait to just go hang out with my friends, but with you I always y'know with a friend.
Chandler!
I know you probably don't want to go out with me, y'know because I make too many jokes and I've never been in a serious relationship and I guess I'm not technically a "doctor..."
There was just one woman, wasn't there?
No, there were two.
Including me?
Oh yeah.
It only takes two heart attacks to finally make you see.../One of them won't do it, but the second one will set you free.../Tell all your hate and anger, it's time to say good-bye.../And that is just what I will do, soon as those bastards I work for die!/La, la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la......
Hey, remember when I had a monkey?
Yeah.
Yeah, what, what was I thinking?
Hey! So, what's with the 20 percent tip? Did I do something wrong?
Twenty percent is a pretty generous tip Joe.
Y'know what's more generous than that?! Fifty percent! Y'know what's even more generous than that?!!
I see where you're goin'!
What's up with the greed Joe?
All right, look I'm sorry you guys, but it's just that I gotta get these new head shots made. And they're really expensive, y'know? I'm down to like three! Well, actually two 'cause one of 'em I kinda blackened in some teeth-Why did I do that?!
Well isn't there something you can do to earn a little extra money? I mean, can't-can't you pick up, I don't know, an extra shift here?
Or, y'know, I used to beg for money. Of course it helps if you've got y'know a little of this goin' on. Wow! I still have it!
Oh, wait! Wait! Don't you have an audition today? Yeah! Maybe you'll get that job!
Oh, ha-ha-ha! Ooh! Wait a minute, I used to get medical experiments down on me all the time!
Ah, finally an explanation.
No-no! I used to get paid for all kinds of medical stuff, remember? Let's see uh, well I don't want to donate sperm again. I really prefer doing that at the home office y'know? Ooh-ooh, maybe they want like some of my blood or-or spit or something, huh?
Joey!
Yeah?
What did I tell you about talking to your friends while you're working?
Uhh do it?
That guy has been waiting for his coffee for ten minutes! He's complained about you three times!
Well, where was I?
Hi!
Hey!
Hey, what have you guys been up to?
Ohh! We went to a self-defense class today!
Wow!
Yeah, kicking a guy in the crotch all morning really takes it out of ya!
Takes it out of you?
Now, we can kick anybody's ass!
Yeah!
After one class? I don't think so.
What? You wanna see me self-defend myself?! Go over there and pretend you're a sexual predator! Go on! I dare ya!!
Well, of course you can defend yourself from an attack you know is coming, that's not enough. Look, I studying kara-tay for a long time, and there's a concept you should really be familiar with. It's what the Japanese call unagi.
Isn't that a kind of sushi?
No, it's a concept!
Yeah it is! It is! It's freshwater eel!
All right, maybe it means that too...
Ohh! I would kill for a salmon skin roll right now!
Y'know what? Fine! Get attacked! I don't even care!
Come on Ross. We're sorry. Please tell us what it is.
Unagi is a state of total awareness. Okay? Only by achieving true unagi can you be prepared for any danger that may befall you!
You mean in case someone is trying to steal your bamboo sleeping mat or your kettle of fish?
All I'm saying is, it's one thing being prepared for an attack against like each other; whole another story being prepared for an attack, I don't know, like a surprise!!
All right, you know that one was coming, but that doesn't mean you have unagi.
Ooh! Y'know what? If we made reservations, we could have unagi in about a half-hour.
Y'know what...
Hey-hey, is Monica here?
No.
No.
Okay, look I need your help, I don't know what to get her for Valentine's Day.
Well, Valentine's Day was like two weeks ago, so I wouldn't get her a calendar!
She was working on Valentine's Day so we're celebrating it tonight.
Ohh, hey! Why don't you book a date for both of you at one of those romantic spas?
Ooh, Joey, that's actually a really good idea!
And of course, crotchless panties.
Well appealing as that does sound to her boyfriend and her brother, I can't do that we promised we'd make each other gifts this year.
Aw, I love that.
You guys!
You can't make crotchless panties? You take, you take a pair of scissors and you just cut...
Okay-okay-okay! So, making things. That sounds like so much fun.
Yeah, I thought so to until I paper mached one of my eyes shut.
Oh, I love paper mache! What did you make?
I made a...
What is that?
Nothing!
So what are you gonna do?
Well, have you guys made anything that maybe I can take credit for?
Ohh! I have! I have! I started making these little sock bunnies! Oh for crying out loud!
Hey, wait a minute! That is my sock!
Now, it's you little bunny friend.
This, this actually is a...
Hey!
Hey! Honey, can I ask you a question about the Valentine's Day gifts?
Oh, yeah.
Do we have to make the entire thing?
Yes! Why, did you-you forget to make yours?
Of course, of course not. I just have to uh, go over to the place where I-I made it and pick-pick it up.
Okay. Okay, I can't wait! This is going to be the best Valentine's Day ever! I can't believe it! Make the presents! Make the presents!
What?
I'm just so excited to make the presents! Shoot!
Hi uh, I'm Joey Tribbiani and with all do respect I'd like to donate some fluids.
We're actually at the end of one of our research cycles, so we're not looking for applicants right now.
Oh that's too bad. I've kinda been saving up. Uh, are you sure there's no studies I can participate in?
Well, here's a schedule of what's coming up.
Thanks. Well but this one starts now.
Oh that one is available now, but only identical twins are eligible. It's a twins study.
But it's $2,000.
Sorry.
Well how about this one? Testing the effects of Joey Tribbiani on attractive nurse receptionists.
We already got the results back on that on, and they're not good.
DANGER!!! DANGER!!!!!
Ross!!!
What the hell was that?!
A lesson in the importance of unagi.
Ohh, you're a freak!!
Perhaps. Now I'm curious, at what point during those girlish screams would you have begun to kick my ass?
All right, so we weren't prepared!
I'm sorry I had to take such drastic measures to make my point, but I-look, I just want you guys to be safe. DANGER!!!!! Ahhh, huh? Unagi.
2,000 bucks is a lot of money. Oh, I wish I had a twin. Where could I find someone who looks exactly like me?
Hey.
Chandler. I sensed it was you.
What?!
Unagi. I'm always aware.
Okay, are you aware unagi is an eel?
What's up?
I can't figure out what to make Monica.
Oh, why don't you make her one of your little jokes.
I'm going crazy! Okay? Do you have any thing around here that looks homemade?
Y'know what? She'd-she'd love this. Uh, it's an exact replica of Apollo 8. I made it in the sixth grade.
Yeah, I guess I could use that. I could say that your love sends me to the moon.
Yeah-yeah, except Apollo 8 didn't actually land on the moon. But you-you-you could write that umm, your love lets me orbit the moon twice and return safely.
Wait a minute, I can't give this to her.
Why not?
Because it says "Captain Ross" on the side and "I hate Monica" on the bottom.
Oh.
DANGER!!!!!
Ahhhhh, salmon skin roll.
Okay. Okay. Yes honey, I made it myself. I can't do it. I can't do it. Oh! Oh! A mixed tape! A mixed tape!!
Hey! Hi! You uh, ready to exchange gifts?
Sure! Okay, you go first.
Okay, come here! Come here.
Okay!
Now, it's not wrapped because I just, just finished it.
Okay.
But I made you a tape of what I think are all romantic songs.
Oh, what a great gift! Is The Way You Look Tonight on it?!
Maybe we'll have to listen and see!
Oh, I love it! Thank you so much!
Okay!
Okay, you ready to open yours?
Yeah!
Okay.
It's a sock bunny.
Yeah-yeah, you remember how I call you bunny?
Not really.
Well, I did one time, and-and I want to start doing it more. See that's what this is about.
I see. Y'know umm, Phoebe makes sock bunnies.
No! No, she doesn't. Uh Phoebe, what she makes-that's uh-they're sock rabbits. They are completely different-Okay! Okay! Okay! I didn't make it! I'm sorry! I totally forgot about tonight and the fact that we're supposed to make the presents!
Oh, it's okay. I don't...
No-no, it's not okay! It's not! I mean you were just... You're so incredible! You went through all this time and effort to make this tape for me! Y'know I'm just gonna-I, I am gonna make this up to you! I will! I-I am going to cook anything you want in here , and I am going to do anything you want in there!
Well, I did put a lot of thought in the tape.
Wow! You are way to young to have seen that!
Oops! Y'know, your birthday is in a month-and-a-half, what do you say I forget to get you a present for that too?
You are totally and completely 100% forgiven.
We have got to wash that!
Yeah!
Do you remember that jacket that you love so much, that you thought was too expensive?
You have done enough!
I wanna wake up early and go get it for you!
No you don't-get it in black, not brown.
Oop, your cake is ready!
Oop!
Well, it's like that old saying, have some sex, eat some cake.
Hey Mon! Hey Chann! Just gettin' a soda!
Who the hell are you?!
I'm Joey! How are you doin'?!
No! No! No! No! No! How you doin'?! How you doin'-Damnit Carl! Go wait in the hall!
Look, I got to apologize on the behalf of Carl.
Who the hell is Carl?!
Oh, did I not mention? Carl is a guy I hired to be my identical twin for a medical research project.
Y'know sometimes the good ideas are just right in front of you, aren't they?
Okay, I know it sounds crazy, but I think it might work. Y'know? The only problem is, Carl's acting is...
The only problem!
Yeah, he's the reason I didn't get that big Minute Maid commercial a couple of years ago remember? We were supposed to be brothers, but he messed it up.
Hey, uh can I get a little piece of that cake?
Pizza!! We like Pizza!! Get out!!!
Pat Sajak?
Yep!
Alex Trebek?
Oh, of course!
Chuck Woolery?
Definitely! Phoebe, you will not find a single game show host, who's ass I cannot kick.
Say it!
Say we are unagi!
It's not something you are! It's something you have!
Say it!
Y'know what? I can easily get out of this, but there is a chance you can get very, very hurt!
All right Carl, we're next. Now remember, what is not gonna be?
Another Minute Maid fiasco.
That's right! And what are you not gonna do?
Well, I'm not gonna talk because...
Damnit Carl!
Can I have the next one please? Joey and Tony Tribbiani.
That's us.
But uh, this is a study for identical twins.
That's right, $2,000.
But, you're not identical twins.
Damnit Carl!
Oh my good God.
Hey! Continuing the countdown of your favorite meals. Tonight, No. 3, macaroni and cheese with cut up hot dogs.
Look, you have done enough! Okay? You have to stop this now.
I will! But not tonight. For dinner music, I thought we could listen to that tape you made me.
Oh, the mixed tape.
The Way You Look Tonight is on here! Dance with me?
You are just the sweetest.
I love the way you look every night Chandler! That's why I made you this tape! Happy Birthday! Love Janice!
No! You're the sweetest!
Okay ladies, that ends today's class, and let's remember, let's be safe out there.
It's a great class.
Thanks.
Yeah, yeah, I was watching. Umm, hey, a couple of questions though. Umm, about that-that-that last move where the woman tripped you and then pinned you to the floor, what-what-what-what would you do next?
Well, she would take her keys and try to jam them...
No. No-no. No. What would you do next?
Who? Me the attacker?
Yes that's right.
Why?
I tired attacking two women, did not work.
What?!
No, I mean it's okay, I mean, they're-they're my friends. In fact, I-I-I was married to one of them.
Let me get this straight man, you attacked your ex-wife?!
Oh, no! No-no! No, I tired! But I couldn't. That's why I'm here. Maybe we could attack them together? That-that's a no.
I am so, so, so, so sorry!
Uh-huh.
And I will cook anything you want in here , and do anything in there!
Yeah you will! And, are you kiddin' me?!
Come on Monica, it's our Valentine's Day. Please? Please-please, please?
Okay.
Okay.
My funny valentine, sweet comic valentine! You make me high over my heart!
So, are we going in there?
I am!!
You're look for laughable...
Ah-ha, nowhere to run!
I don't like sitting up here! I'm just gonna over...
No Rachel! They got here first!
Why is Ross doing that?
DANGER!!!!
Oh my God! Why is he jumping on those women!
We should help him!
I... Well, I don't think they need any help.
Hey! I just got uh, my teacher evaluations! Check out what this one student wrote, "I loved Dr. Geller's class. Mind blowing lectures! Dr. Geller, you are definitely the hottie of the paleontology department!"
Ahh, Hotties of the Paleontology Department, there's a big selling calendar, eh?
Who wrote it?
Oh, I wish I knew, but the evaluations are all anonymous.
Oh hey, do you still have their final exams?
Yeah.
Oh, 'cause you can just match the evaluation to the exam with the same handwriting and boom, there's your admirer.
A hot girl's at stake and all of the sudden he's Rain Man.
Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, why are we so sure that this is a girl?
It's a girl! Anyway, it wou-it wouldn't matter. Okay? Because I'm a teacher and she's a student.
Oh, is that against the rules?
No, but it is frowned upon.
I see.
Besides, there's a big age difference.
Oh, well think of it like this, when you're 90...
I know when I'm 90 she'll be like 80 and it won't seem like such a big difference.
No that's not what I was going to say at all. No, what I was going to say is when you're 90 you'll still have the memory of what it was like to be with a 20-year-old.
Hey Chandler! Y'know that girl you went to college with who-who became a movie director?
Oh yeah, Dana Keystone. She was in my Movement class.
What's a Movement class?
It's Chandler's way of pretending he didn't take mime.
Oh well listen, anyway she's directing the new Al Pacino movie. You gotta get me an audition!
Oh, I don't know man. I haven't talked to her in like ten years.
No-no-no, please-please Chandler I-I-I would owe you so much!
You do owe me so much. You owe me three thousand, four hundred...
Hey-hey dude, why are you changing the subject? Why? Will you make the call or what?
Oh okay, I'll-I'll try.
All right! Thanks! You're the best! Now listen, the last day of auditions is Thursday. Okay? So I gotta get in there by Thursday. Okay? Just remember Thursday. Thursday. Can you remember Thursday?
Yeah so, Tuesday?
Thursday! Look if you need help remembering think of like this, the third day. All right? Monday, one day. Tuesday, two day. Wednesday, when? Huh? What day? Thursday! The third day! Okay?!
Thank you.
Okay.
Hey Mon? I'm gonna check my messages.
You just thought of that in there?
Yeah sure, nature called, she wanted to see who else did.
Hello? Uh, Rachel. Great, someone is in our apartment. Call the cops!
You're on the phone!
Oh my God! Oh my God! Thank you! That was the fire department, there was a fire at our place!
Oh my God! How bad was it?
Well, he didn't say, but it was a fire. I'm guessing not very good. Come on, we gotta go!
Come on!
What are you smiling about? What is so funny?
The part I want to audition for is a fireman, this is so meant to be!
Wow! It looks like you were very generous with your grades this semester!
Professor Geller?
Yeah?
I wanted to say how much I enjoyed your class.
Oh thank you. Thanks very much. Ow!
Uh, I'm a little embarrassed about calling you a hottie on my evaluation...
That was you?
Yeah. I felt a little weird about it. You're a teacher. I'm a student. But would you maybe want to go out with me sometime?
Oh I, I don't-I don't think that would be the best idea.
Oh, because I was thinking, the semester's over; you're not my teacher anymore.
What time?
Oh, y'know what? Forget it, you already gave me an A.
Gotcha.
I'm kidding!
Oh! So-so seriously, what time?
Coming through! Oh! Coming through! Oh! Hello! Hi! No! Right! Coming through!
Oh well, it's not so bad.
Yeah, most of the damage is pretty mostly contained in the bedrooms.
Oh!
My God!
Hey buddy, do you think I can borrow your uniform this Thursday?
Excuse me?
Joey! He's working! You would look good in that.
Oh, how bad is it?
Oh, it's bad. It's really bad. The only thing in there that isn't burned is an ass. Which I do not remember buying!
How's your room Rach?
Everything's ruined. My bed. My clothes. Look at my favorite blue sweater.
Isn't that mine?
Fine! I'm sorry for your loss!
So uh, you're not gonna be able to live here for a while, you ladies have a place to stay?
Wow! Oh-okay, look pal, I am not in the mood to be hit on right now! But if you give me your number I will call you some other time.
Yes, they can stay with us.
Have you figured out what started the fire Mr. Fireman?
Well uh, do either of you smoke?
No, not usually. But yeah, I could use one right now.
No-no-no, do you uh light candles? Burn incense?
Yes! I do! All the time! I love them! Oh my God! I did it! It's me! It's me! I burned down the house! I burned down the house!
Okay Phoebe calm down, there's no need to place blame. Okay? I warned her about those candles.
God, it's great to catch up! I can't believe how long it's been!
Chandler, is that...
Oh that's great! Good for you.
Hey-hey listen...
Okay! So yeah, maybe we can get together umm... Can you hold for one second please? What?!
When you're off the phone, do you wanna get a pizza?
Hi! I'm back. Yeah, that sounds great. Okay. Well, we'll do it then. Okay, bye-bye.
Hey listen, so when's-when's my audition? I mean I know it's Thursday, but what time?
Hi.
Hey!
We didn't get to the audition. I'm gonna take her to coffee and then we'll do it then.
Ah-ha!
Wow! So, now you're going on a date with this girl?
Honey, it is not a date! I haven't talked to her in ten years! You can't just call up somebody you haven't talked to in ten years and ask them for a favor. There are rules, y'know? You gotta, you got to put in some time.
You're right, I'm sorry. It's not like you're y'know, going out with an ex-girlfriend.
No, we only went out once.
You dated her!
Not once!
All right, well why don't I go out with an ex-boyfriend and do Joey a favor?!
Hey, you wanna do Joey a favor, maybe you go out with Joey.
Oh that's great, my friend Joey's in the movie business.
Y'know who I ran into from school? Howie.
My friend's name is Joey.
Apparently Howie's editing now. Yeah, he-he-he calls me up and asks me if he can edit my new movie. Can you believe that?! Y'know I-I-I haven't spoken to him in like ten years and he asks me for a favor!
Yeah, I've always hated that Howie.
No, no "How you doing?" Man, I mean not even a cup of coffee first!
The nerve huh?
Yeah!
Refill?
Now, this is last minute so I want to apologize for the mess. Okay?
Oh my God! It sure didn't look this way when I lived here.
I know! Now look, there's only one problem though. There's only room for one, so I guess one of you will have to stay at Joey's.
Well, since the fire was kinda my fault I guess you should get to stay here.
Hey! Hey-hey, now this was no one's fault Pheebs. Okay? It was an accident.
Well no, it was my fault so you should get the nice room.
Okay!
So Rach! You're the first guest at Hotel Monica! Umm, you'll just have to tell me how you like your eggs in the morning. And I thought I would bring them to you, y'know, in bed. Oh, you have been through so much.
I have.
This right here is where I keep the pizza. And uh that's where the napkin is.
What's that smell?
I know!
Oh please! It was such a big class! You never even noticed me!
What? Of course I did! You uh, you sat next to Sleepy Sleeperson.
Who?
Oh uh, I had trouble remembering everyone's name, so I-I kinda came up with nicknames. Like the guy on the other side of you was Smelly von Brownshirt.
Oh yeah. So umm, did you have a nickname for me?
Umm, no. No.
Yes you did! What was it?
Umm, it's Cutie McPretty.
Ohh that's so sweet!
Listen, I gotta tell ya, I-I'm having a great time! Y'know how before you said it might be weird, the whole student teacher thing, and to be frank I thought it would be too, but it's not. I mean it's not at all.
Dr. Geller!
Burt!
So did you sleep well last night?
I did.
Yeah?
I did, Monica was so sweet she left a little mint on my pillow.
Y'know what Joey left on my pillow?
What?
Gum!
Well, we determined the cause of the fire.
Yeah I know, it was my candle. My candle!
No, there was an appliance left on in the bathroom. It's looks like a curling iron.
I don't use a curling iron.
Well someone does.
Well, don't look at me! My hair's straight! Straight! Straight! Straight!
It could've been a hair straightener.
Oh.
This is where I keep the pizza. And-Hey! Where did the napkin go?!
Now there you go! I wouldn't want my best guest to strain her eyes!
Thanks Monica!
Does that smell bother you?
What the smell from Joey's? No, I can hardly smell it over here.
Well you let me know if you can, because y'know I can bake a pie to cover it.
I can smell it a little, bake the pie.
Okay!
Okay.
Hello? Oh yes, one minute please. It's for you. It's the fire inspector.
Oh! Hello? Yeah this is Phoebe. Really?!
Yeah, so it turns out that it wasn't the hair straightener that started the fire. No-no, it was the candles. It's very not good leaving candles unattended. In fact, one of the first things they teach you in fire school is... Uhh... Uhh... Okay. Well, I have to go now.
We had such a great time! She's-she's incredible! I thought the-the age difference might be a problem, but it wasn't. It wasn't at all. Elizabeth is very mature for her age. A concept lost on some people!
So it's okay to date a student.
Well, not really. I mean technically it's-it's not against the rules or anything, but it is frowned upon. Especially by that professor we ran into last night, Judgey von Holierthanthou.
Well Ross, you be careful now. You don't want to get a reputation as y'know Professor McNailshisstudents.
Yeah. What-what should I do?
Well Ross, it seems pretty clear. I mean what's more important? What people think or how you feel, huh? Ross, you gotta follow your heart.
Joey that is so sweet.
Hey.
Hey-hey-hey! So, how did it go with Dana? Any reason I should leave a block of time open say Thursday?
I couldn't do it.
You couldn't do it?!
Hey, relax I just need more time. We're going to dinner tonight.
What?! You're going out with her again!
Going out with who?
Uh, Dana Keystone from college.
Oh yeah! Wasn't she uh...
No, that was Dana Caplin.
Ohhhh!
Joey! You didn't even know her!
Ah whatever!
Great story again! The yarns that you weave! Woo-hoo-hoo!
Y'know uh, actually I-I-I should get going.
Oh no-no-no! Stay! Stay! Because you-you should you-you-you should stay!
Wow. Oh, I am really flattered, but I just I don't feel that way about you.
Oh no-no-no, that's not-No-no-no!
I'm sorry Chandler, y'know you are such a sweet guy and I, I don't want to hurt you. Oh, I wish there was something I can do to make you feel better.
No-no-Really?!
Of course!
Well, it just hurts so bad. I uh...
Ohh, I'm sorry.
Well maybe there is one thing you can do.
What?! Anything! Anything!
Well, I umm, I mean this is just off the top of my head now, umm but I have this friend. This actor friend and he would kill me if he thought I was doing this umm, but umm would it be possible for him to get an audition for your movie say on Thursday?
Absolutely! But you-you would really feel better about me rejecting you if your actor friend can audition for my movie?
Well, the heart wants what it wants. I'll see you later.
Hey! How's it goin'?
Well, not much has changed in the last five minutes.
Yes it has! I made cookies!
Oh that's all right. I'm still full from your homemade potato chips.
But you should eat them now because they're hot from the oven.
Okay.
Oh-ho! But not in here! Can't eat 'em in bed, remember? No crumbies!
Okay, I'll be out in a second.
Okay!
What are you doing?
That doesn't lock does it?
Oh, Joey! Sorry!
No that's all right. Don't worry about it.
Oh but look! That's gonna leave a stain!
Rach! Hey! It's fine! You're at Joey's!
Really?
Yeah! Look!
I've never lived like this before.
I know.
All right, don't waste it, I mean its still food.
What do you want to do now? Huh? You wanna go get a drink?
Uhh, I can't.
Oh, you have some studying to do?
No, I have some turning 21 to do.
Y'know I remember when uh, when I was in college, we used to...
What are you doing?
Nothing, I'm-I'm just, I'm so comfortable with you!
Do you not want to be seen with me?
What? No! Of course, of course I do! Are-are they gone?
Uh no, they're still here but I think I'm about to leave.
What?! No! No! Wait! You're right, this is stupid. Who cares what people think? I mean, I mean we like each other right? There's nothing wrong with that. Come on. Burt? Lydia? Mel? This is Elizabeth.
Hi!
Aren't you in my Popular Culture class?
That's right Lydia, Elizabeth here is a student and uh, we're dating. And you may frown upon that, but we're not gonna hide it anymore.
You are so fired.
What?
They're gonna fire you! You can't date a student! It's against the rules.
Really? Its not just frowned upon?
I love it at Joey's!
Hey, here you go.
Ni-hi-ice!
Thanks!
So, you busy Thursday?
Oh, very funny. I don't know if you remember, but my audition was supposed to be Thursday. You got me the audition?! Let's hug it up!
Okay. Okay. What are you gonna do to me if you get the part?
Hey! Hi!
Hi!
Listen umm, yeah okay, I need to talk to you!
Uh-huh.
Now I know that they said that the umm, the hair straightener started the fire but I think I'm partly at fault. You see, I didn't, I didn't tell you but umm, but I-I had recently refilled the tissues and so y'know let's just face it, that's just kindling! So I think it's better that I stay at Joey's.
No, no-no-no. Phoebe, this was my fault and besides y'know what? I'm fine here.
Okay. Oh umm, Chandler, Monica is looking for you.
Really?
Yeah she said something about crumbies.
No! No! No! I was so careful!
Okay, you have to switch with me! Monica is driving me crazy!
That's right, all the ladies want to stay at Joey's.
No! No! Phoebe, come on! I don't want to switch! Please come on! I can throw wet paper towels here!
No but at Monica's you can eat cookies over the sink!
I know. I'm sorry.
All right fine! This looks like so much fun.
Yeah.
God, what a mess.
Wow! It actually is in the handbook. I can't date you or have a hot plate in my office. I can't believe we have to stop seeing each other.
For what it's worth I did appreciate you standing up for me. It felt really nice. It kinda made me like you even more.
I know, I know I really like you too. But we-we can't date. It's against the rules. It's forbidden.
Wow!
What?
Just hearing you describe it as forbidden, it's really hot.
Really?
Yeah.
Well I-I-I don't care how hot it is it's-it's uh, it's wrong.
Stop it!
No! No! It's wrong! It's-it's-it's naughty. It's taboo.
Shut the book!
Let's also get a hot plate!
Hey!
Hey!
So?!
So?
It's Thursday! How was the audition?!
Wh? Monday, one day. Tuesday, two day. Wednesday, when huh what? Thurs- Oh!
Well that thing is clearing in the way! All right. Ah-ha! Ah-ah!! Damn fridge!
Hi Joey, how ya doin'?
Great! Roomie!
Huh, yeah I guess we are roommates now.
Yeah! Well, now that you brought it up, our fridge is broken. We have to get a new one. Now, I checked around and your half is $400. Thanks a lot.
I'm not paying for half of that! I'm only staying here until my apartment gets fixed.
Look Rach, my parents bought this fridge just after I was born, okay? Now, I have never had a problem with it. Then you show up and it breaks! What does that tell ya'?
That refrigerators don't live as long as people.
All right, now you know that the ATM will only lets you take out 300 at a time, I'll take a check for the other hundred.
You're jokin' right?
Of course I'm jokin'! I don't take checks.
Thank God you're pretty.
Hey!
Hi! Hey!
Do you guys know any cute guys?
Well, of course I do! My good friend Joey over here.
Oh, I'm sorry. Thank you Chandler.
Anyway, there's this big charity ball this weekend and Ralph Lauren bought a table, so I kinda have to go...
What's the charity?
I don't know, something either trees or disease-Ralph mumbles a lot.
Does Ralph mumble when you're not paying attention?
Yeah! It's weird. But the thing is need to find a date.
Well, what kind of guy are you looking for?
Well, someone that has his own tux, or has the ability to rent a tux.
So he has to be a male who has at least $50.
Ooh! So close.
Hey everybody!
Hi!
Hey uh, this is Elizabeth.
Oh hi!
Hi!
I'm the student.
Isn't she cute? No!
Y'know, this is probably none of my business, but weren't you guys supposed to not be seen in public together?
Oh, we're not together.
Oh no-no-no, we're just two people who happen to run into each other here at the coffee house.
Oh, sly.
Well, I really wanted to meet you guys, but I have to run. I'll see you later?
Okay!
Bye Ross.
Bye.
Oops! I did not mean to run into you like that sir.
Oh that is quite all right ma'am.
So, why is she leaving? Is it a school night and she has a lot of homework to do?
Yes, her molecular epidemiology paper is due tomorrow.
Oh, tell her good luck with that.
Anyone else? Huh? Bring 'em on!
Oo! When's her birthday?!
I don't know Rachel, why?
Well, y'know it's just been so long since I've been to Chuckie Cheese.
Oh, I like Elizabeth.
Well thanks!
Yeah. In fact, I like her so much you tell her I want my cookies early this year! Y'know, a box of Thin Mints and some Tag-a-Longs.
Hey-hey come on you guys, give him a break. Ross, seriously, how's it going with her?
Well, actually it's been great. She's 20 so she's not looking for anything too serious, which is perfect for me right now.
Well that is great. And seriously, she seems very nice.
Thanks. I know you guys like to give me a hard time and all, but it really means a lot to me that you like her. Just knowing that you guys are...
Okay, I got a good one. Okay, umm, what is she? Like 12?
Chandler, do you think we talk about our relationship enough?
Yeah. Do we have any Fruit Roll-Ups?
Hey!
Hey!
Okay, I just thought of the perfect guy for Rachel to take to her thing.
Oh that's so funny because we found someone too.
Oh that's good, I guess she'll have a choice between my guy and your weirdo.
Why would our guy be a weirdo?
'Cause that's just your taste.
Rachel is not going to pick your stupid guy.
Oh yeah?
Yeah!
My guy is a lawyer who has volunteer work. And, he has one of these
A face ass?
A chin dimple!
Well, uh y'know, our guy works with Chandler and he's really nice and smart and he's a great dresser!
Have you seen your guy's body?
No, our guy is just a floating head.
Well my guy is spectacular. Okay? He's a massage client and one time umm, when he was on the table, I looked at it. And I mean all of it.
You're not supposed to look!
Oh yeah, like there are police for that!
Wait! You look? You-you massaged me.
I know.
All right fine, your guy may have a great body, but our guy is really funny.
Oh, Chandler funny?
Our guy's a great dancer!
My guy is well read.
Our guy has great hair.
My guy has great teeth!
Our guy smells incredible.
Do you want our guy to be your guy?
Hey.
Huh.
Well, you...don't look good Joe.
The fridge broke. I have to eat everything. Cold cuts, ice cream, limes-Hey, what was in that brown jar?
That's still in there?!
Not anymore. So anyway, how do you want to pay me?
Is this a service you're providing me?
No! No! No! For my new fridge-our new fridge!
Our new fridge? I don't live here anymore.
So what? Look, suppose we were a divorced couple.
Uh-huh.
And I got custody of the kid, right? Now suppose the kid dies and-and I gotta buy a new kid.
Okay...
Give me $400!
Professor Geller?
Hmm? Oh, a student I don't know.
I was wondering if I could talk to you for a moment?
Yes, yes of course, what-what would this be regarding?
Making out in your office.
Shh! Of course, why don't we go inside?
Oh-ooh!
What?
Doorknob! Doorknob!
Oh! Sorry! Umm, I actually do need to talk to you.
Oh, okay. What-what about?
Spring vacation.
Spring vacation.
Yeah, we have time off and a lot of people are going on trips...
Professor Geller!
Yes, professor Feesen-sen-stenlger... I'll be with you in one moment. So, I will take one box of the Thin Mints.
You don't understand! Elizabeth was about to ask me to go on a trip with her! Is that taking it slow?! No, I'm not ready for this! Okay? What-what do I tell her?
Just tell her the truth! Tell her you're not ready.
I can do that. Oh-oh, what if she gets upset?
Then you distract her with a Barbie doll.
Or! You can just, y'know...
What the hell are you doing?
What? What the hell am I doing? You just broke my fridge!
What?! What? How do you, how do you even know its broken?!
Oh-ho-ho, you think I don't know what breaks my fridge? Excuse me! Well what do you know! Broken! That'll be $400!
Joey, I saw you push him!
You pushed him!
Joey, I did not break this! Okay? That has been broken for a while.
All right. Chandler, do you remember how I told you about our fridge?
Uh-huh.
I still haven't gotten a check for your half yet.
Do not give him any money!
I'm not talking to you! You broke my fridge!
You wanted to see me Professor Geller?
Yes. Yes! Please, come in.
Oo-oo!
Doorknob?
Yeah, it kinda grows on you. Actually, I wanted to finish talking to you about uh, spring vacation.
Oh good.
Look, I... Look, I'm having a great time with you and I just don't want us to move to fast or put to much pressure on us. So, I'm sorry I just don't think we should go away together yet. It's-it's too soon.
Ross, I think you misunderstood what I was saying. I just wanted to tell you that I'm going to Florida for a couple weeks.
No. I think you misunderstood what I was saying. What I meant was...
You are so adorable.
That! Let's talk about that.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey! How did it go with Elizabeth?
Huh? Oh-oh, it was fine. Uh, it was just a misunderstanding. She didn't want me to go with her. She just wanted to let me know that she's going to Florida for spring vacation.
Wait a minute, is she going for spring vacation or is she going for spring break?
What's-what's the difference?
Well, spring vacation is doing nice things with your grandparents. Spring break you're doing frat guys.
Hey, y'know what? Not all spring breaks are like that.
What did you do on yours?
I went to Egypt with my dad.
I can see it now, "Look dad, it's the Sphinx!"
Hey, I think Elizabeth is a little more serious than, "Spring break!" All right? I mean she's taken my class!
And slept with the professor.
I'm gonna call her.
Yeah.
Hey! You guys umm, I want you to meet Sebastian.
Hi.
We just uh, we just met at the newsstand. We both grabbed for the last Field & Stream. What? I read that.
Can I get you a cup of coffee?
Oh yes! Thank you!
Rachel, what the hell is this?!
What?
You ask us to find you a guy and you come traipsing in here with your own!
You found me a guy?
Yes! We found you a really cute and funny guy from Chandler's work!
Yeah and I-I found you one too who is not a weirdo.
Well, y'know what though you guys? I really appreciate that but I think I'm just gonna take Sebastian to the charity.
Are you sure?! Because our guy smells incredible!
Uh, would you stop it with that already?!
Here you go.
Oh, thank you.
Sure.
So, Sebastian, do you do any volunteer work?
Uh, no not really. Why?
No reason, it's just I know a single guy that cares about other people.
Are you funny?
Excuse me?
What are you guys doing?
Are you funny? Tell us a joke!
Look, I just wanted to have coffee with Rachel.
Well, so do a lot of people.
Actually, I uh, I gotta get going. Give me a call sometime.
Oh, but y'know, no, you didn't give me your phone number.
Okay! See you later!
Turns out he is kinda funny.
I cannot believe you guys! He was really nice and he left because of you!
Yeah, but Sebastian? What is that? A cat's name?
Yeah, y'know what I noticed Rachel? He scares easy. Is that the kind of guy you'd like to take to a ball? "Hey Sebastian, would you like to dance?" "Uhh, okay-I gotta go!"
All right guys stop it. Rachel, we're very sorry that is a very insensitive thing for us to do. And y'know what? Let us make it up to you, we have two really great guys for you.
Yeah! What have you got to lose? Y'know you might even end up with someone really special if you pick my guy.
All right.
Okay, so you will meet our guys?
Yes, I'll meet 'em.
Okay now it doesn't matter which one you choose, y'know? It's completely up to you. Our guy is perfect, or you can go out with the guy Phoebe deemed not good enough to go out with herself.
Pheebs! There you are! Okay, you broke my fridge; you owe me 400 bucks!
Okay sure!
Really?!
Ooh, technically you owe me $600 for sending out happy thoughts on your last ten auditions.
Call it even?
Okay.
Well, there you are! So what did Elizabeth say?
Well, it turns out that she is going to Daytona for spring break woo-hoo. That means, that means wet T-shirt contests, guys doing shots off of girl's bodies, waking up next to people you don't even know...
Man, she is going to have a great time! Is she staying at the Hotel Corona?
You know the hotels?
Sure! I was there! Spring Break '81! Woo-hoo!
In 1981 you were 13!
So what? I drove down, sold T-shirts, had a blast. And y'know who knows how to party? Drunk college chicks.
Okay, she can't go.
Ross, you can't tell her not to go. You just started dating.
Then what am I supposed to do?
Nothing, you just have to be cool with it.
Well, what is she goes down and-and sleeps with a bunch of guys?
Well, maybe you don't marry this one.
I'm so glad you're going on this trip!
Yeah! I've been working so hard this semester. I really need to go crazy y'know, blow off some steam.
Sure. Sure. Look I don't, I don't know if your plans are finalized yet, but umm, hey I-I know another great way to blow off steam.
What?
Are you into crafts at all?
Ross, are you okay?
Well, yeah, of-of course I'm okay! What? I'm just being supportive. Supportive of you and this whole trip, and-and what-what is uh, what's this?
It's a bathing suit?
To wear in front of people?
Is that supportive?
Is this?!
Hey!
Good-good-good-good.
Hey!
Hey!
Hi!
We're really glad you decided to meet our guy.
Oh...
You're gonna like him so much. So umm, when do you want to meet him?
I don't know. I know I don't work late tomorrow night.
Tomorrow night is good. Tomorrow night is good, but uh, y'know what? Why put off something till tomorrow that you can do right now? Eldad come here!
What?
Eldad, this is Rachel.
How are you?
Well-well a little blind sided but y'know good.
Eldad, sit down. Move over! Move over now!
I-Ohh!
There you go! There you are!
Okay! Okay! We can take a hint! What are you doing here?!
This is Patrick.
Hi.
Hi. Okay, you're too late okay? Because she's already with our guy.
Oh my God, you're right! I am too late; they're sitting on the couch and talking! Come on! Rachel?
Yeah?
This is Patrick.
Oh, hi.
Hi.
Yeah, this is the guy I was telling you about.
Yeah?
Yeah. And believe me, this suit does not do justice to what's underneath it.
Oh-okay, but Pheebs?
Yeah?
I'm just sort of in the middle of something.
Oh! Okay! Yeah, that's okay. Have a seat.
No! You can't do that!
Maybe I should go!
Sit down! We're winning!
Okay, y'know what? Maybe I should go!
No-no-no-no! Have a seat! Have a seat!
Rachel! Rachel! You haven't touched Eldad's hair!
It is the softest hair! Touch it!
Yeah, I'm good.
Rachel? Patrick is really rich. Give her some money.
Y'know what Phoebe? This isn't really worth the free massage.
That's right Patrick, bye-bye!
Eldad is much more cooperative! And he can dance! You dance for Rachel!
No-no! Don't dance for me! Please? Don't! What is the matter with you guys?
Yeah, okay, let's talk it out.
I... Am I the only one that this is embarrassing for?
I'm a little embarrassed.
I'll tell ya who should be embarrassed! It's you guys! Come on! This is ridiculous! Thank you very much, but I do not need you to get me a date!
Then why did she ask us to...
I am still talking!! And then you chase away the one guy that I actually liked! I mean, no offense to you guys. Really! I mean congratulations on all the cash, and-and y'know--Wow! You do have very soft hair! But I would much rather go to the ball all by myself than go through anymore of this! Good-bye! Now do you use some sort of special conditioner on that hair?!
Yes, Papaya Extract.
Thank you!
So uh, have a great time down there.
I will.
Yeah. And did you, did you pack that bathing suit?
Yeah.
It was pretty funny when I, when I hid it for a while, huh? Anyway, umm, I-I am worried about that bathing suit, not because it's revealing which I'm fine with, no I'm concerned about your health, sun exposure.
Oh, don't worry I have plenty of sun block, it's SPF-30.
Well, if what's in the bottle is actually 30. I mean sometimes you get 30, sometimes it's-it's get 4, and I swear to God more often than not it's just milk.
Ross, it's going to be okay. I'm not going down there to hook up with a bunch of guys. I really like you. I like how things are going between us.
Really?
Yeah! I'm just going down there to relax and hang out with my friends.
Okay. Cool.
Oh hey! Here they are!
Elizabeth!
Call me!
Rachel, we're sorry for pushing those guys on you.
Oh that's all right! Y'know, I ended up having a really good time. Y'know, the charity was a big success and they raised a lot of money and awareness.
So what was it for anyway?
I wanna say a disease.
Hey!
Hey!
I just got this really weird message from Ross. He said turn on MTV.
Huh. All right.
Oh my God, look! That's Elizabeth!
Oh-oh Professor Geller.
Ahh, to be 13 again.
Yeah.
The reactor's gonna blow in three seconds, we're never gonna make it!
You've got to get out of here! Save yourself!
No! I won't leave you!
Don't worry about me, I'm a robot! I'm just a machine!!
No you're not! Not to me!
Oh my God.
What?
I am extremely talented!
Yeah, you're great! Okay, let's take it from...
No, I mean I was really acting my ass off.
Yeah, I thought I was pretty good too.
Oh yeah, you're solid. Yeah, you're just no me.
Y'know what? I think that's enough for now. Yeah. I don't want to be over rehearsed.
Fine! I'll do it without you! I don't need you or anybody else! I'm gonna make it on my own! You'll see!! You'll all see!!
So uh, what's this thing you're auditioning for?
Oh, it's a new TV show. Yeah. I'm up for the part of Mac Macaveli or "Mac." Yeah, I'm a detective and I solve crimes with the help of my robot partner. He's a, he's a Computerized Humanoid Electronically Enhanced Secret Enforcer or-or "C.H.E.E.S.E."
So Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.
That's the title! Yeah! Y'know they really lucked out that the initials spell cheese.
That is lucky.
Huh-Wait so Joey if you get this, you're gonna be like the star of your own TV show! I mean you'll be like the Big Cheese! Or the Big Mac-Hey! You love those!
Well, don't get your hopes up, because probably not gonna happen.
Now-now, why would you say that Joseph?
I mean come on you guys! My own TV show? I just don't know if I'm good enough.
I am.
Joey, what are you talking about? You're a terrific actor.
You really think so?
Ugh, how can you even ask that question?!
Whoa, she's pretty.
Yeah, and oh she's really nice too. She taught me all about how to work the cameras, and smell-the-fart acting.
I'm sorry, what?
What?
Excuse me?
It's like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one. So while you're thinkin' of it, you take this big pause where you look all intense, you know, like this.
Oh, ok.
There's my scene, there's my scene. "Mrs. Wallace, I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray, your sister's neurosurgeon. I'm afraid the situation is much worse than we expected. Your sister is suffering from a..."
Vell, Eva, ve've done some excellent vork here, and I vould have to say, your pwoblem is qviiite clear.
I Play Al Pacino's Butt. All Right? He Goes Into The Shower, And Then- I'M His Butt.
Oh My God.

Oh No, It's Terrific, It'S- It'S- Y'Know, You Deserve This, After All Your Years Of Struggling, You'Ve Finally Been Able To Crack Your Way Into Show Business.
Okay, Okay, Fine! Make Jokes, I Don'T Care! This Is A Big Break For Me!
You're right, you're right, it is.
Yes.
So you gonna invite us all to the big opening?
All right well, I'm outta here. Wish me luck.
Gooood luck! Gooood luck! We all wish you good luuuuuuuuck!!!
Yeah, whatever.
It's your turn.
Oh, are we playing this?!
Hey.
Hey! How'd the audition go?
Terrible! I messed up every line! I shouldn't even be an actor!
Wait a minute, are you doing that thing where you pretend it didn't go well but it really did go well?
Yeah, did I fool ya?
Totally!
So it did go well.
Oh, it went amazingly well!
Great!
Oh that's great!
Yeah-yeah, it's down to me and two other guys.
Oh my God!
Wow!
And I know both of them, they're really good. One of them is the guy from those allergy commercials who's always getting chased by those big flowers...
Oh, I love that guy!
Oh-oh, what are you doing?
What am I doing?
I'm just so nervous! Y'know? The callback isn't until tomorrow at five. I feel like my head is going to explode!
Well, it is overdue.
Look, don't worry. Okay? You're gonna be fine.
There's just so much pressure. I mean no offense, but what you guys do is very different. I don't know if you'd understand.
Yeah, none of us have to deal with pressure at our jobs.
Yes, Fran. I know what time it is, but I'm looking at the WENUS and I'm not happy!
Alright, well I'm tearing the lettuce.
Uh-huh. Is it dirty?
Oh-oh, no no don't worry, I'm gonna wash it.
Don't, I like it dirty.
That's your call.
So, uh, what are you going to do next?
Well, I thought that I would cut up the tomatos.
Are they, uh, firm?
They'r alright.
You sure they haven't gone bad? You're sure they're not very, very bad?
No really, they're OK.
You gonna slice them up real nice?
Actually, I was gonna do them jullienne.
Aaaahhhhhhh.
I'm outa here.
Monica, I'm quitting! I just helped an 81 year old woman put on a thong and she didn't even buy it! I'm telling you I'm quitting! That's it! I'm talking to my boss right now! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Okay bye, call me when you get this message.
Well, what happened?
Well, he came in for a massage and everything was fine until...
Ohhhhhh!
Oh my God!
And all of the sudden his hands weren't the problem anymore.
Was it...
Oh, Boy Scouts could've camped under it!
You ate my sandwich?
It was a simple mistake. It could happen to anyone.
Oh-oh really?
Now-now calm down. Come look in my office, some of it my still be in the trash.
What?
Well, it was quite large. I-I-I-I-I had to throw most of it away.
You-you-you-you threw my sandwich away!
MY SANDWICH?!!!
MY SANDWICH!!!!!!
I want this part so much! Y'know? If I don't get this part I'm never gonna eat Macaroni and Cheese again!-No, I didn't say that! That's a lie.
Oh come on guys, it's not like I moved to Europe! I just moved across the hall! And we would have you over all the time if it weren't for Monica's allergies. You're right, I could never lie to you. She hates you. Should I get that? Hello? Uh no, Joey's not here right now. Can I take a message? Yeah, okay so the audition has been moved from 5:00 to 2:30? Okay great. Bye.
Ahh! Aren't you dressed yet?
Am I naked again?!
We're supposed to meet my parents in 15 minutes.
Yeah okay, I was just talking to the guys. Just look at them I mean, is it okay if they come visit?
Wh?! What about my allergies?!
Oh right, your allergies. All her, she hates you.
Yes!! Ha-ha!! All right! Hey! How cool would it be if you could watch like a real life-sized version of this? Huh? I mean how crazy would that be?
As crazy as soccer?
Hello? What are you talking about? The audition's not 'til 5:00! Well, nobody told me! Who'd you talk to? Nevermind!
You mean you didn't get it from this?
The allergy guy got the part! Thanks!
Well, maybe we can fix it y'know? Maybe we can send him some-some big-big flowers and scare him!
How could you do this to me Chandler?! This part could've turned my whole career around!
I messed up. Okay? I'm sorry, I really messed up.
Hey, you don't even live here anymore! What are you doing answering my phone? I have my machine!
Which I bought for ya. Taught ya how to use it. You thought it was a copier. Look, if there was anything I could do, I would do it. Okay? But everybody's allowed one mistake, right?
You know he coulda gotten me a VCR, he coulda gotten me a set of golf clubs, but no, he has to get me the woman repeller! The eyesore from the Liberace house of crap!
It's not that bad.
Oh, yeah, easy for you to say, you don't have to walk around sporting some reject from the Mr. T collection.
Chandler, Chandler.
I pity the fool who puts on my jewelry, I do, I do. I pity the fool that. . . Hi!
Yeah, I mean when you were late last night, Kathy and I got to talking, and one thing to another and...
And what?! Did you sleep with her?!
No! No! No! I just kissed her.
What?!! That's even worse!!
How is that worse?!
I don't know! But it's the same!
You're right, I have no excuses! I was totally over the line.
Over the line?! You-you're-you're so far past the line, that you-you can't even see the line! The line is a dot to you!
Look, I'm not saying that you should magically forgive me! But you're not perfect! You've made some errors in judgment too!
Name one!
What happened?!!
Awww, man! He promised he wouldn't take the chairs!!
What the hell happened?!! How were you locked in?!! And where the hell is all of our stuff?!!
Well, this guy came by to look at the unit and-and he said he didn't think big enough to fit a grown man!
So--You got in voluntarily?!
I was tryin' to make a sale!! Oh, man, if I ever run into that guy again, do you know what I'm gonna do?
BEND OVER?!!!
Ok, now, remember, no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess.
Hi, Joey. Well well, look what you brought.
...And what did you bring?
She's checking the coats. Joey, I'm gonna go wash the cab smell off my hands. Will you get me a white Zinfandel, and a glass of red for Janice.
Janice?
Janice?!
Oh.... my.... God.
Joey's tailor...took advantage of me.
What?
No way! I've been going to the guy for 12 years.
Oh come on! He said he was going to do my inseam, and he ran his hand up my leg, and then, there was definite...
What?
Cupping.
That's how they do pants! Ross, will you tell him? Isn't that how they measure pants?
Yes, yes it is. In prison!
I said name one!
I can't believe I did this! What an idiot!
Oh, stop beating yourself up! People make mistakes! These things happen! There aren't any message you've forgotten to give me are there? Apparently you're not very good at it! I...
Do you think he'll ever forgive me?
Of course he will! But Chandler the most important thing is you forgive yourself!
Y'know what? I-I kinda have.
Already? That's pretty bad what you did.
Y'know what? He will forgive you. And I like to bring a pad with me when I go answer the phone just in case... Okay...
You didn't see how mad he was, y'know?
I'm sure he will forgive you. Look, we have all been there! Y'know, you fight, you make up, it's just the way it works.
It took two people to break up this relationship!!
Yeah! You and that girl from that copy place, which yesterday you took full responsibility for!!
I didn't know what I was taking full responsibility for! Okay?! I didn't finish the whole letter!
What?!!
I fell asleep!
You fell asleep?!
It was 5:30 in the morning, and you had rambled on for 18 pages. Front and back!! Oh-oh-oh, and by the way, Y-O-U-apostrophe-R-E means 'you are,' Y-O-U-R means 'your!'
Y'know I can't believe I even thought about getting back together again! We are so over!!
FINE BY ME!!
And hey! Just so you know, it's not that common! It doesn't happen to every guy! And it is a big deal!!
I KNEW IT!!!!
You had no right to go out with him.
That is the most ridiculous...
You sold me out.
I did not sell you out.
Yes you did. You absolutely sold me...
Would you let me talk.
Did you just flick me?
OK, well, you wouldn't let me finish and I was jus- Ow. That hurt
Oh! All right. Now, let's not do this!
Happy thoughts! Happy thoughts!
OK, now I'm gonna kick some ass.
Ow! Ow! Ow!
I know! I know! I know!
Alright, now I will let go if you both stop.
Fine!
Fine!
There we go.You know what, if we were in prison, you guys would be, like, my bitches.
Okay, buddy-boy. Here it is. You hide my clothes, I'm wearing everything you own.
Oh my God!
Look at me! I'm Chandler! Could I be wearing any more clothes? Maybe if I wasn't going commando...
Yeah. Whew, it's hot with all of this stuff on. I ah, I better not do any, I don't know, lunges.
Joey? Got you a Joey Special, two pizzas! Joe? Hello? Damnit! Hello? No, Joey's not here right now, but I can take a message I think. He's still got a chance for the part?! Oh, that's great news! Well no obviously not for the actor who was mauled by his dog. Oh well, that's great. I will give Joey the message. Thank you! Yes! Okay, Mac audition at 2:00. Allergy actor attacked. By dog not flowers.
Hey!
Please tell me you got the message!
What message?
The actor playing Mac couldn't do it, they needed to see you at 2 o'clock.
What?! It's 6 o'clock!
Du-du-I wrote it, I wrote it on the board! I wrote it on the board, then I went all over New York City looking for ya! I went to Ross's! I went to the coffeehouse! I went to any place that they made sandwiches!
I can't believe this Chandler!
Sorry! I-I-I don't know what to say.
Well you-you-you-you might say congratulations! I saw the board! I went to the audition! I got the part!!
Is that supposed to be funny! I was really worried over here!
Oh, well I'm uh...
Y'know, sometimes that fake out thing is just mean!
Oh wow! Okay man, I'm sorry. I did not mean to make you feel bad.
Well that's good. Because you didn't! And I'm incredibly happy for ya!!
That's mean! You really had me going there!
Oh, we could do this all day.
Yeah, you're right. Okay look, listen, let's talk about what a huge star I'm gonna be!
You are gonna be a huge star! I'm gonna hug ya!
You hug me!
All right!
Hey, do we do this too much?
I think so. Yeah, get off me.
Yeah.
Come on C.H.E.E.S.E., I'm not leaving without you! Try routing your backup source through your primary CPU.
I can't! My circuits are fried! They're fried I tell you!!
Wow! Well then I'll just have to carry you.
That'll be a neat trick, when you're, when you're dead!
Ross, you don't have to yell.
There was just an explosion, okay? My hearing would be impaired.
I thought you were excellent! In fact for a minute there I was like, "Ooh, where'd Ross go?"
Thank you! And I have to say that first scene when you meet Mac...
Yeah?
Oh my God. I mean...
Y'know what? I think that's enough for today. Thanks for your help!
He's holding us back.
Totally.
Okay, Chandler!
Okay.
And your horoscope says, "On the fifth a special someone is going to give you a gift."
Oh, well thank you in advance.
Op, but the twelfth brings a lover's spat.
You are going to make a joke about my special present! Why would you do that?!
Oh, wait and on the nineteenth a secret crush announces itself.
Hey guys!
Hey!!
Oh my God! It's Joey Tribbiani of Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.!!!!!!!
Oh that's right. It's your first day! So are you psyched to fight fake crime with your robot sidekick?
Am I psyched? The lead in my own TV series? I've dreamed about this for years! Why have I not been preparing?!
No! Joey, you're going to be great!
But I got to act with a robot Pheebs, and-and I don't know anything about technology! I can't even use Chandler's computer except to find porn! And-and that's only 'cause it's right there when you turn it on!
I think our lover's spat will start a little early this month.
I'll be waiting.
Are you judging them by their covers? Because you're really not supposed to do that.
No, I'm just deciding which one to use-I'm gonna start writing another book!
Be-because the last one was such a big seller?
Well, if you must know I have written 14 books. And as I am the only one who has read them, I can tell you that they all have been very well received.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
What are you guys doing later?
Oh, Rachel and I have appointments to get our hair cut.
We do?
I want to see what he wants first.
Okay.
I just found out that Elizabeth's dad wants to meet me.
Wait a minute, hold the phone! You're not Elizabeth's dad?!
Come on guys, I-I really want this guy to like me. It-it would really help me out if you guys were here to make me look good.
Of course we'll help! Yeah! We'll be here!
Thanks!
We know how tough those parent/teacher conferences can be.
So uh, here's your office set!
Wow! Huh? Mac Macaveli, Private Investigator!
Let's get you into wardrobe for a fitting.
Okay. Hey uh, when do I get to meet the robot?
I'm sorry, why don't we do that right now? He's right here.
Okay.
Joey Tribbiani, this is...
Oh wow! He's so lifelike! Unbelievable! (He starts tugging on the guy's ears.
This is Wayne, the man who created and operates C.H.E.E.S.E.
How do you do there, Wayne?
I'll let you two guys get acquainted, huh?
Okay. Sorry about that... Uh, so where's C.H.E.E.S.E.?
C.H.E.E.S.E. is right here.
Nice to meet you Mac!
This is like the temporary robot, right?
No. Why?
Well, I-I just, I just it was going to be like a really cool robot, y'know? Like the terminator or uh, when I first saw you.
I spent two years developing this machine, it's absolutely state of the art.
I'm sorry, it just-I don't know it doesn't really look like it can do anything.
It can do this.
This is my father, Paul Stevens. Dad, this is Ross Geller.
It-it's great to meet you Paul.
I usually prefer Elizabeth's boyfriends to address me as Mr. Stevens.
Of course, of course, Mr. Stevens.
So Ross, what your problem?
Eh-wh-Excuse me?
Why can't you get a girlfriend your own age?
That's funny. Umm.... It's not funny.
I don't like you going out with my daughter Ross.
Okay. I can, I can see that. Umm, but I think if you give me umm, one chance I can, I can change your mind.
Okay.
What?
Okay. I'll give you one chance to change my mind. You got one minute.
Daddy!
Fine! Two minutes. Go.
This is-you-
1 minute 50 seconds.
Okay, umm I want you to know that I have never done anything like this before. I mean, I mean I've been in um, relationships in general, uh but I have never done it with a student-I mean I not-not it! I mean, I mean I don't-We haven't done it. Uh, I mean, I mean, we've-we've-we've done stuff. Okay, okay, a joke, a joke-lighten the mood. Umm, two guys go into a bar. One of them is Irish.
I'm Irish.
And the Irish guy wins the joke!
Ross!!
Ross!
How crazy that we'd run into you!
Oh God, thank you! Umm, uh, Mr. Stevens I'd like you to meet my friends uh, this is Phoebe, Monica, and Chandler.
You're Elizabeth's father, huh? I can see now where she gets her rugged handsomeness.
Is-is-is there a-a Mrs. Stevens?
There's a Mr. Bing!
No, unfortunately Lizzie's mom passed away shortly after she was born. I raised her by myself.
Ohh!
I get that a lot.
Okay umm, why don't we all take a seat, y'know? And uh, and I'll get us all some uh some coffees--Yeah, why don't you. Uh and you guys can talk about whatever, whatever you want. Y'know? Whatever pops into your head.
Y'know, it is so strange seeing Ross here this time of day, 'cause usually he's got the children's hospital.
Yeah. Not looking for dates.
So uh, Monica is Ross's sister.
And he's a great brother!
I had a sister.
Ohh!
She passed away.
Ohh!
Oh, you don't have to do that every time.
But uh Ross, Ross is a great guy! I was roommates with him in college. Uh, funny story... You're roommate in college died didn't he?
A part of him did yes.
Okay here we are Paul, Elizabeth. So I hope you guys were finding something to talk about.
Yes, we were just...
Hi, I'm sorry I'm late but I am ready, ready to talk you up! When does Liz's father get here?
I'm already here.
Oh! Ross is sooo great!
Hey honey, you got the kind with the little girl, you said we were gonna to get the kind with the baby.
No, you said the baby creeps you out.
No, the little girl creeps me out.
You said the baby.
Why would the baby creep me out?
Why would the little girl creep you out?
You guys, I'm sorry, could you please talk a little slower?
This is going in your book?
Yeah, it's about relationships. Y'know? The traps, the pitfalls, what not to do, keep going. This stuff is great!
What?! Excuse me!
And how none of it matters when the people really love each other. And how people will believe anything you tell them as long as it's a compliment.
Oh hi!
Hi! Hi. I think I left my keys here somewhere.
Oh! Well let's look for them. Oh-oh-hey! Are these them?
No.
All right!
Oh, here they are right here.
Oh good.
Thanks for your help.
Oh, wait! Sorry, Mr. Paul? Mr. Paul?
Just call me Paul.
Paul. Umm, I just wanted you to know that Ross really is a great guy.
Well maybe you can date him then that would save me the trouble of killing him. Are you okay?
You just don't look old enough to have a twenty-year-old daughter.
Well, we were very young when we had her.
Oh. We?
Well yeah, it usually, it takes two people to...
Oh no! Yes! Of course, I know that! I just-I meant y'know are you still a 'We' or are you just 'You?'
I'm just me, my wife died shortly after Lizzie was born.
Ohh. So you raised her all on your own?
Yes I did.
Ohh. Ooh!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
How was your first day?
Pretty great! Except I did get a little attitude from the robot.
Damn those robots, they're supposed to be our faithful servants!
Anyway, it wasn't the robot, it was the guy who controls him. Yeah, he doesn't like me. He had C.H.E.E.S.E. knock over the sandwich right when I was reaching for one! Ohh!
Well, why don't you just get him fired?
I may have to, I hate to do it, but I'm the star! Y'know? There's a limit to how many sandwiches I can eat off the floor. Excuse me. Joey Tribbiani.
Joe! I'm glad I found ya, I got an audition for ya!
Wow!
The thing is it's kinda on the Q.T. The actor who has the part doesn't know he might be fired. It's the lead in a series, Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.
I'm the lead in Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.!!
Uh-oh!
Joey?!
Hi Ross.
I was just getting him to like you.
Joey?! Joey!!
Ross, Joey is not here.
Okay, I'll just wait for him in here!
Ross, it's okay. You can come out.
Yeah Ross it's okay, it's me, Mr. Stevens.
Oh! Oh my God! I didn't even see you!
Sure you did! You came in, you got all awkward, and you ran into the bedroom. You were shouting, "Joey! Joey!" Bye Rach.
Bye!
I'll call you later. Bye Ross.
What-what-what the-how da-how did-what the-how did-what?!
Well, y'know he lost his keys so he was looking for them...
In your mouth?!
No! Downstairs! And we got to talking y'know, for like two hours, and I really liked him so I invited him up here for a cup of coffee.
You were at the coffeehouse!
Ross, what's the big deal? So I kissed the guy!
He is my girlfriend's father, okay? It's-it's, it's weird!
Wh-You dated my sister!
That was different!
What? Why?!
This is weird for me!
Ross look, look this is good for you. Okay? Let's face it, so far the guy's not lovin' ya! But I can turn that around! I got the inside track! We can all go out to dinner, y'know? And I can talk you up! Ross, the guy is a very, very successful lawyer!
How is that important?
Oh it's important!
Apparently, there's like a million guys out there that can play Mac, and there's only this one robot and this one guy who controls it! I didn't know he could get me fired! What am I going to do?
Well y'know Joey, you're a pretty charming guy.
Thanks, but I kinda have a problem to deal with here.
No sweetie, you've got to win over the guy that controls C.H.E.E.S.E.! You've got to kiss some serious robot ass!
That's not a bad idea. Yeah. Okay, but if I got to turn on the charm tomorrow I'm not wasting anymore of it over here with you guys. Well, actually I got a little bit saved for you Pheebs.
So do you think uh, Joey's more charming than me?
Yeah! That's why I'm sleeping with him on the side.
Yeah, you wish.
"You wish."
Phoebe, stop writing about us!
I'm not writing about you! I'm writing about other people.
Who?
Marcia and Chester.
Okay fine! Fine! Then you know what, I'll just write about Phyllis! Hmm!
Hmm.
Phyllis is sitting in a chair.
Oh.
I see what you're doing!
Phyllis sees what I'm doing.
Oh-oh.
Ooh, I have tasted my own medicine and it is bitter!
Morning! Hey, how's my favorite genius and my little robot buddy?!
Don't touch him!
Okay! All right. Umm, all right Wayne, level with me. Okay? I-I keep hearing all these rumors that I might get fired. Okay, they even have actors coming in to read for my part! Come on man, you-you got to give me a second chance! I mean, I love-I love this little guy! Ah-ah!! Okay, that's why you didn't want me to touch him right? Here you go! Okay? Stupid! I can't believe it! God! Hey, how you doin'?
So it seemed that my prom date had stood me up, so Ross selflessly, offered to take me.
What a nice story!
So Ross was in college and decided to jump at the chance to take a young girl to her high school prom.
Wow! I definitely did not see that one backfiring! I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
Yeah, take your time.
Just-just so you know I was a freshman and she was a senior. So it wasn't as bad as-as...
Ross, look, I know I've been giving you a lot of jabs and it's partly because I'm very protective of Lizzie, and partly because well, they just keep coming to me. But I have to admit that after all the wonderful things that Lizzie has told me and the many, many, many stories that Rachel has told me that, well you're not all bad.
Not all bad.
And anyhow, I'm sorry I was so harsh before, but you have to understand that I still look at Lizzie like she's a twelve-year-old girl.
Yeah. You know what? I know what you mean; I do that too.
I beg your pardon?
No! No! Not-I don't mean I-I see her as a twelve-year-old girl! I mean I-I have a son, who's umm six and I still think of him as a baby.
You have a son?
Yeah, well my-my ex-wife and I share custody of Ben and umm, uh, and just so you know, Carol and I are on excellent terms as I'm sure you are with your wife! Oh, I'm sorry! It's unbelievable!
Don't worry about it, I just didn't realize you were married.
Oh we were, but that was just a , I mean that was just a big drunken mistake.
You're back.
You two were married?!
Oh! Whoops! I'm sorry, you were talking about Emily!
Chandler, we said we would meet at the coffeehouse at six.
We said seven!
We said six!
The only way that I said six would be if the seven's, let meet at seven, not at six.
Yeah and if I had seven, maybe I would've said something like this, "Wow! My boyfriend's such a wise ass-seven!"
Hi!
Oh my good God.
Ugh!
I know what time you said.
What?!
Well actually, I know what time Chester and Marcia said.
What time?
Quite an interesting turn of events, suddenly it's my book to the rescue, huh? Ooh, very interesting. Yeah, well this certainly clears things up.
What does it say?!
I will tell you as soon as you thank me for writing my book.
Thank you for writing your book. Its-its uh, great book and you are the queen of everything.
Thanks! So are you.
I told you I should not wear this color.
Mon... Marcia and Chester are planning on seeing a movie on Sunday night. Marcia thinks they're supposed to meet at six, Chester thinks it's at seven.
So you knew we were gonna miss the movie!
That's right.
Inside of telling us you decided to write in your stupid book!
Marcia and Chester are mad at Phyllis.
I can't believe I'm going to lose this job!
Oh I'm so sorry man! Is there anything I can do?
Yeah! Help me get this mini-fridge past the security guard.
Hey Joey, I want to talk to you.
Yeah? Well, I don't want to talk to you Wayne! I hate you! You ruined my life! Oh, Chandler, Wayne. Wayne, Chandler.
Hi, how are ya?
Joey, Joey, I-I-I'll g-get you your job back if you help me out.
Why should I help you?!
The reason he just said.
What do you need?
I-I-I saw you on stage talking to that beautiful woman, y'know Sarah?
Yeah?
I wish I could talk to her.
What are you in love with her or something?
Yeah. Her. All of them. Anyone.
Yeah, I've been there my friend.
Listen, I-I guarantee you keep your job if you can teach me how to talk to women like you do.
Oh wow Wayne, it's not really something you can teach y'know? It's pretty much something you're born with if you--You-you can teach it! I'll show you right how to do it.
I mean if you think about it, I mean Ross did learn something from each marriage.
How to make the next one even shorter?
Now wait a minute that's not fair. He was married to me a hell of a lot longer than he was married to Emily, he just didn't tell me. Maybe I have to pee again.
Well, this is fun. So Ross, did you kill any of these wives?
Y'know what? I-I-I... I-I have had enough of this! Y'know, I-I-I care a great deal about your daughter and I have treated her with nothing but respect! So if-if you've got a problem with me, frankly...
Are you yelling at me?!
God no!
Y'know what daddy? If you don't like Ross, that's fine. It doesn't matter to me, I'm gonna go out with him anyway.
Really?!
Well if it doesn't matter to her, it doesn't matter to me! Still not yelling!
Wow. What can I say? This doesn't make me like you any better!
That's okay, I'm not so crazy about myself right now either.
Then we agree?
Uh yeah, I guess-Yeah! I guess so.
Neither of us like Ross!
I like Ross.
Ohhh! Kids!
Wait-wait-wait, I just thought of another story about how nice Ross is!
That's okay Rach, we're not liking Ross right now.
Oh! I've got a lot of those too!
Well, it turns out you were right C.H.E.E.S.E.
The shipment never made it through Omaha?
You got it! And the rabbi's beard, 100% horsehair. Nice catch C.H.E.E.S.E.! It's your line C.H.E.E.S.E.! Wayne! Wayne!!
Hi, you guys.
Hey!
Hi!
What's the matter?
Well it's just-it's one of those situations that I just hate. Y'know? A massage client gave me three tickets to the Helmet-Pelts exhibit at the Morgan Chase museum.
Now you're thinking you gotta sleep with him.
No! No! It's just that he gave me three tickets and there are six of us!
I'll give up my ticket.
Me too.
Okay that's so generous!
And I think Ross is generous too.
Great! Okay then it's just us girls!
Great.
Yeah.
So what-what is the exhibit.
It's mostly just photographs of lesbian love scenes interspersed with video games and free sandwiches.
Oh man!
Hey!
Hi!
Hey!
Hey Ross listen Chandler got you out of going to the lesbian sandwich museum this weekend!
Thanks? But I have plans; Elizabeth and I are going out of town.
Oh that's great!
Yeah.
I mean think about all the money that you're gonna make!
Why? What?
Well, her father pays you for baby-sitting right?
No, no, that's funny. But maybe it's time to move on, let it go, y'know? Stop it! Besides, Rachel is going out with Elizabeth's father, so ah, he's much older than she is. Looks like I'm not the only one interested in fossils, huh?
I mean Ross all that does is remind us that you are interested in fossils.
Okay, okay. Uh, well uh, Rachel is going to need to yell sweet nothings in his ear.
Ross.
Oh, come on you guys; that's funny! Y'know? Because he's need-he's got like a hearing aide y'know, 'cause-'cause y'know, 'cause he's all old, and...
Okay look, Ross, just so you know that since Lizzie likes you so much, I've decided to accept the fact that you're going out with her.
Really? That okay, that's great.
Yeah. But then I changed my mind. I'm funny like that. So I told Lizzie, now I'm telling you, I don't want you seeing my daughter anymore.
All right look, I-I realize it upsets you.
Yes it does.
But, Elizabeth and I are-are both adults and so I don't think there's really anything you can do about it.
I'll call the university and tell them about your relationship and have you fired.
Ohh! A man with a plan!
Oh, this is so exciting! You get your picture back up on the wall of fame! Eek!
I know. It was so cool when I was up there before. Me and Jim Belushi would just be crackin' up about something... Then I get fired off of Days Of Our Lives and he takes me down. Now he's just laughing at me. Look at him, that smug Belushi bastard, I'll...
Ohh, okay maybe they put your picture back up they can put you next to Matt Lauer. Look at him, smiling at me. Yeah I know; we'd be great together!
Hey! So I'm back.
Who are you?
Joey Tribbiani! From the wall! Okay, maybe this will jog your memory, huh? Huh? Okay eh-ah-anyway, I'm ready to go back up on the wall I'm the star of a new TV show.
Show me in the table.
Oh well, it's not on TV yet.
Well, then it's not on the wall yet.
Okay, fine, I will bring you a tape, huh?
So umm, now do you have any of Matt Lauer's clothes here? Maybe? Just ones that haven't been cleaned yet?
Oh, I love museums!
Umm.
Soakin' up all the culture.
Yeah.
Where do you want to start?
Ooh, the gift shop!
Yeah!
Hey, and then lunch.
Oh, wait yes, but I can't eat too much. Paul is taking me out to dinner tonight, he said he has a big surprise planned.
Oh wow. What, do you think maybe he's gonna tell you that he's gay?
What?! No! Why?!
No reason! That would just be a really big surprise, right?
You can put the aisle over here , and put the wedding ceremony right over here.
I didn't know you could get married here.
This would be a beautiful place to get married, yeah, but I wouldn't put the aisle there and I would never have the ceremony there! I mean you'd have the ceremony under this big beautiful arch.
May I help you?
Oh sorry didn't mean to interrupt. It's just such a beautiful space; do you do a lot of weddings here?
Yes. We're very popular. There's a two-year waiting list. Sorry!
Monica, you should totally put your name down on the list
What?! Are you crazy?! I'm not getting married! I'm not even engaged.
Yeah, but there's a two-year wait. And then what if you get engaged in two years and then you got to wait another two years for this place. That's four years. Chandler's not gonna wait that long. He's gonna find somebody else, y'know? Someone, someone who did put their name on the list.
Yeah hon, it can't hurt to put your name down! I mean in if two years if you're not engaged you just don't use it.
Well, I mean I guess there is no harm in putting my name down.
I'm gonna do it too!
Me too!
Really? Who would, who would you marry?
I don't know, I don't have anyone right now. Y'know?
Oh Pheebs.
Don't feel too sorry for me. At least my boyfriend isn't gay.
Phoebe, that stuff is...
Don't even get me started on yours!
Hey! So, did you watch the tape of my show?
I did.
All right, let's get me back up there!
No! It don't go up on the wall!
What-But you saw the show!
Yes, it was very offensive to my people!
Dry cleaners?
Russians! It showed them as terrorists and villains!
Okay! Okay, look! You-you-you got Harrison Ford up there!
That's right. Mr. Ford is a very good customer, he brings us a lot of clothes; you bring us nothing!
Okay well that may be true. But, in-in okay, Air Force One the Russians were terrorists! And evil! And plus he kills a bunch of them! That-that-that's offensive to Russians.
I've never seen it!
Oh you should, it's great.
This place is really beautiful!
Yeah, I've been coming here since I was a kid. This used to be my Grandma's.
Wow! The only thing I got from my Grandmother was her eyes. I mean not-not her actual eyeballs, but, but people say that my eyes-Do-do you want to make out?
Sure!
Are you okay? What's wrong?
Ehh, I was just, I was just thinking about your father.
Well, whatever works for ya...
No. No-no uh, he just, he just really freaked me out before.
Oh. Well, so we have to hide our relationship from one more person. Big deal. Besides, it's kinda fun hiding.
Yeah.
Hey umm, you brought protection right?
Why?! Are there like bears or something?! Ohh. Oh, protection. Yeah-no, yeah-no, that-that-that I forgot.
I'll just run to the store and get some.
Oh no! Hey-hey, I'm the guy! I'll get it.
Do you know where the store is?
No.
Do you want to ride around town on my little pink bicycle?
A little bit.
I'll be back in ten minutes.
Okay.
Why don't you get in the hot tub and I'll meet you there.
Ohh, okay.
Oh my God, what a great surprise! This is such a beautiful house.
Thank you, it's my mom's. So this is the kitchen.
You've reached Monica and Chandler's, if you're listening to this message, we're probably screening. Yeah we are.
Hi, this is Heldi from the Morgan Chase museum. I'm calling for Monica Geller. I want to let her know that there was a cancellation and if she's still interested in having the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility, it is available...
This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing! Yes, the groom-No! Not the groom!!
It's so secluded up here.
I know. I like it up here.
I feel like we're the only two people in the world. Oops. Sorry.
What's the matter honey? Did you see a little mouse?
No-no! Big bear! Big bear outside! I think I-I-would you-actually, would you go check on that?
Honey, we don't have any bears here.
Well, okay. Would-would you get me a Diet Coke?
Okay. I'll be right back.
Okay. What?! What are you doing here?!
What are you doing here?!
I came with Paul!
Yeah, I recognize the ankles!
Get up!
Here you go honey!
Ahh. Thank you!
Diet Coke.
Op, ice. I need ice.
Okay.
Thank you.
I'll be right back.
You and your ice.
Ugh! Get out! Get out! Go! Come on! No! Not in there! He's in there!
Did you really hear a bear?
Go-go!
Here you go honey. One Diet Coke with ice.
Ohh, thank you.
I'm so happy that you're here.
Here I am!
Elizabeth! Oh look, Elizabeth's here! Who are you talking to?
Uh, you guys?
How did you know we were here?
Umm...
Well, she-she ob-obviously saw the tire tracks that were leading up to the closed garage.
Obviously.
Elizabeth, what are you doing here?!
Did-did you come up here to work on that term paper or something?
Yeah! Yep.
Well, why do y'know go in that room and do your homework?
Ohh, I wouldn't do it in there. That's my dad's bedroom.
That's your, that's your dad's bedroom. That's your dad's bedroom!
Why are you yelling?
Whoa, that Diet Coke just went straight to my head! Woo!
Hi, honey.
See you later.
What? I-I bought groceries, I was gonna make you dinner!
Well next time ask! Or at least wait for me to ask!
Hi, this is Heldi from the Morgan Chase museum. I'm calling for Monica Geller.
Oh no!
I want to let her know that there was a cancellation and if she's still interested in having the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility, it is available...
Oh please, he didn't hear it! He didn't hear it!!
This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing!
NOOOO!!!!!!!!
Can I help you?
Uh yeah, where-where's the guy who decides who's pictures go up on the wall?
He's not here right now.
Oh, you're kidding me! All-all right, well make sure you tell him that Joey Tribbiani stopped by to drop off all of these clothes. Okay? I'm an actor; I'm kinda getting my picture up there on the wall.
Y'know, there are two people who could put your picture up there.
Oh really? Well, maybe you and I go out for drinks? You're the other one right?
So Lizzie, are-are-are you planning on staying the night?
Oh no-no believe me, I'm leaving as soon as possible!
Good. Good. Not that we don't want you to stay, obviously you're welcome-How much more homework do you have?
Ahh, I just have one problem left that I do not know how to solve. Uhh, Rachel maybe you want to come upstairs and help me figure it out?
Really? Okay. Okay, I-I'll go upstairs. If-if you get me something from the car.
What do you need from the car?
Surprise me.
Okay.
So you're gonna be in the car, I will be upstairs, and that's where everybody's gonna be!
Just relax. Just relax Paul, you're doing great. She likes you. She... Maybe, she likes you. She likes you. Y'know why? Because you're a neat guy. You are the man. You are the man! I still got it. Nice and sexy. You're just a love machine. I'm just a love machine and I won't work for nobody but you! Hey bab-y! Showtime. I'm just a love machine, yeah ba-by!
Phoebe!
Yeah?
Have you seen Chandler?!
No! Why?
The woman from the museum called and said that there was a cancellation and that we could move up our wedding and Chandler heard! I know! How bad is this?!
Well for the regular guy, it's bad, but Chandler, Oh dear God!
I know! I know! And he totally freaked out and I can't find him anywhere!
What are you gonna do?
Well, I'm never gonna listen to you again, that's for sure! "Y'know, harm can it do if you go and put your name down?"
Rachel said that!
Well Rachel's not here!
Oh! Here it is! Ooh, Joey! Why did you sign it, "Son of a bitch?"
I didn't do that! Who would've done that?!
Son of a bitch!
Okay, maybe ask this guy.
You, get out of my shop!
Well, what did he do?
He went out with my wife!
Joey!
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, I-I-Hey! I did not go out with your wife! Okay? I went out with her!
That's my wife!!! Get out!
Well, we should go.
Yeah.
Ross? Ross?
Elizabeth! Okay. Okay. I'm gonna go out this window. I'll meet you at the front door. Just tell them you're going home, okay?
Okay!
Oh wait-wait-wait!! No! Don't go in there! Don't go in there! I need another soda!
Ross!
Oh my God Ross! What in heaven's name are you doing here?
And that is why we cannot see each other anymore.
Ross. You and I are going to have to have a little talk.
Daddy!
You're next!!
Okay. I didn't know he was here.
Let me just see if I got this straight. I tell you to stay away from my daughter or I'll have you fired. What you heard was, "Take my daughter, come up to my country house, and ruin my weekend with Rachel!"
Okay, please-please Paul, just let me explain...
No, let me explain! Fired!!
All right, fine! Fine! Have me fired! But uh, I want you to know that you and I are not all that different. I mean, I too am a neat guy.
What?
And I too am just a love machine.
Ross, let me show you where the guest room is.
I'm so sorry. Please, stop freaking out.
I'm not freaking out. Why would I be freaking out? A woman named Heldi called and said we were getting married, but that happens everyday.
Honey, we were at this beautiful place, and I-I-I just put our names down for fun! I mean, what's the harm in that?
Right here!
Chandler, please don't think I was trying to pressure you. Phoebe and Rachel...
Phoebe and Rachel! So the people that knew about our wedding before me were you, Phoebe and Rachel, Heldi, and apparently some band called Starlight Magic 7 who are available by the way!
It was a mistake. Please don't take this to mean anything, because it doesn't.
Okay.
Really?
Yes, if it really doesn't mean anything, because you know that I'm just not ready...
I know! I know.
Okay.
I'm gonna go tell Joey that that you're back. I was really worried about you.
Hey, did she buy it?
Totally.
So did Heldi show you the place?
Yeah, it's beautiful.
I can't believe you're gonna ask Monica to marry you!
I know.
Hey Gunther.
Hey! Take these cappuccinos to table 11 and that guy over there wants the biscotti.
Oh uh, well I just came in for a cup of coffee to go.
Do you still work here?
No! No, I quit a long time ago. Did I forget to you that one? I'm sorry.
Oh that's cool, I was gonna fire you anyway.
Great!
Pheebs, can you help me pick out an engagement ring for Monica? I can't figure this out! It's so hard! Should I get her a Tiffany cut or a Princess cut or a-ah-ah! Paper cut!
Now, have you told anyone else?
No, I don't want to tell anybody else because I don't want Monica to find out.
You told me.
Well, it's because I trust you, you're one of my best friends, and you walked in on me when I was looking at ring brochures.
Yeah well, once again not knocking pays off. I only wish you hadn't been on the toilet.
Me too.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey! So Chandler, wanna go to the coffeehouse?
Oh all right.
Yeah, coffeehouse.
Oh perfect, we were just gonna see if you wanted to go.
Oh well, we don't because we got...the...other pl-place.
How rude.
Oh, I'm sorry. You wanna bite?
So how are things going with Paul?
Good. Although y'know, he-he's a private guy. Y'know, I wish I could get him to open up a little bit, share some feelings.
That's easy! You just have to think of him as a-as a jar of pickles that won't open.
So what are you saying; I should run him under hot water and bang his head against a table?
No that's what you do when you want to get the truth out of someone.
Hi honey.
Hi!
Watch this.
How are you?
Okay.
Hi Paul!
Hi Phoebe.
So how are things going with you?
Can't complain.
Come on.
Okay.
Hey!
Hi!
Ross!
Great to see you!
Good to see you too!
How you doing?
Good. Bye!
Okay! You take care!
Hey Pheebs, what-what was the deal with you and Chandler blowing us off before?
Yeah! That was so weird, huh?
Phoebe, why'd you do it?
I didn't do it! It was Chandler! He's... He's mad at you!
What?! Why?!
Please, I think you know why.
I can't think of anything.
Come on Ross, you're a paleontologist, dig a little deeper.
Wait a minute, is it because Joey and I didn't invite him to that Knicks game a couple of weeks ago?
Do you think that's something that he'd be mad at you for?
I guess it could.
Well then I think that's it.
Well, if he's angry, he really shouldn't just cover it up. I-I wish he would just tell me the truth.
Oh, if that's what you want you then you really should run his head under hot water and bang his head against a table.
Honey I made a reservation at China Garden, is that okay?
Yeah that's great. But first, wait, talk to me, talk to me. Tell me about your day.
It was fine.
Okay. Hey, what are you thinking? What are you thinking right now?
I'm thinking that you are looking really fine it that dress.
Yeah that's great Paul, but y'know I wanna know what--Wow, those are really great! I just wanna know what, what is behind this-this strong, silent exterior. Y'know they say that still waters run deep and I wanna swim in yours.
Are you talking about having sex?
No Paul, I don't know anything about you! Y'know, like-like your childhood! Tell me about your childhood!
Normal.
Okay, well then how about puberty! Come on, that's always a painful time! Y'know your friends invite you to a slumber party and then they stick your hand in warm water while you're sleeping so that you pee in your sleeping bag.
Nope! That never happened to me!
Well, you're lucky you never met that bitch Sharon Majesky. Anyway, umm... The rest of you life, y'know? Any regrets?
Nope.
All right Paul, I'm not asking for a lot here. Okay? Just give me something. Anything!
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
All right.
When I was six years old.
Hm-mmm.
I wanted a big wheel. And instead my parents got me this little plastic chicken that you hop around on. It was embarrassing; kids made fun of me. That was a pretty tough year.
That's-that's great! See? I already feel like I know you a little better! Thank you. Okay, come on. Now we can go eat. Let's go.
It was horrible. They called me chicken boy.
Oh!
And in fifth grade I got into a fight. Well, it wasn't really a fight. Richard Darinvel bit me on the nose and, and I feel down. I still have a little scare right here you can see it.
Yeah. Yeah, I-I-I see the scare. Listen, Paul, I think this is really great that-that y'know, you shared your feelings. It's really, it's beautiful, but umm, what do you say we go share some food?
Oh, I couldn't eat now.
What?! Wait! What are you talking about?! You love their Kung Pao Chicken!
Chicken? Chicken boy!
My God, I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I didn't mean to do that! I wouldn't do that!
Nothin! This is the nine millionth ring store we've been too and I can't find the perfect ring! Ugly ring! Ugly ring! Ugly ring! It's a beautiful selection.
Okay, so maybe you don't get her a ring. Maybe you-maybe you do something different. Y'know? Maybe you get her an engagement bracelet, y'know? Or an engagement tiara? Or-ooh! An engagement Revolutionary War musket! (Picks one up from the display in the corner.
Y'know, I'm so glad I picked you to help me with this.
Huh? Can you just imagine getting down on one knee and handing her this gorgeous piece of weaponry?
Yeah, I'm gonna stick with the ring. Oh, this one's nice! I like this one! Sir? Uh, kind sir? Can I see this one?
Wait a minute, no, this is, this is the reason you brought me. Okay? I know how to haggle. So let me handle this from here on out.
Can I help you?
Uh-uh, yes. I would like to see that ring please.
Or not, whatever.
This ring is from the 1920s, it's a one and a half carat diamond with sapphires on either side.
Sir, can I ask you to umm, could you...hold out that ring and ask me to marry you?
Okay. Will you marry me?
Oh my God that's it, that's the ring! How much is it?
Chandler, I-I will handle this! How much is it?
8,600.
We will give you $10.
Are you interested in this ring?!
Yes! Yes, but I can only pay $8,000.
Okay, I can let it go at eight.
We stand firm at $10.
How would you like to pay?
Uh, credit card. Oh no! No-no, but I left my credit card with Joey. Okay, I'll go get it. You guard the ring.
Okay. Listen, I'm sorry about before. Do you have anything her for $10.
Uh yes, I have these two rather beautiful $5 bills.
I'll give you $1 for them.
Hey, remember how Chandler and Phoebe blew us off yesterday?
No.
Remember? You-you were eating pizza.
Yeah.
Okay. Well, apparently Chandler's angry at us for not getting him a ticket to that Knicks game a couple of weeks ago.
Oh, we're supposed to just get him a ticket?! That guy is always mooching off of us!
Yeah! Anyway, I-I still think we should try to patch things up, y'know? Like uh, maybe we could get him to get tickets to another Knicks game and invite him.
Oh wow that's a great idea! And I still have his credit card.
Here you go.
Oh.
Hey-hey-hey-ho-ho, I got this one. Here you go. Y'know I gotta tell ya, sometimes I just-I don't get Chandler. Y'know, me and him do stuff all the time without you and you don't get all upset.
All the time?
All the time!
Oh my God! Oh my God!!
Still crying?
Like a little girl. I know. I know. I know. This is all my fault; I wanted him to open up. But God, I didn't know that I was gonna unleash this-this weepy, clingy, moist monster!
Y'know, I only know of two surefire ways to shut a man up. And one of them is sex.
What's the other one?
I don't know, I've never had to use the other one. I'm just saying y'know, if we're having sex, he's not gonna be talking.
Oh that's right. You're the talker. Anyway uh, great idea! Umm, I gotta go to the store; I told him that I would buy him some more tissues.
Oh, we have some...
No you don't!
Okay umm, I'd also like to try on the tiara. Oh yeah. Okay. What do you think, too much?
A tad.
Okay. Then, take the tiara back and let me hold the musket again. Something's missing. It's not... Okay oh, let me see the ring my friend picked out.
Where's the 1920s princess cut ring.
I just sold it to that gentleman.
Oh my God!! No! What?! Help me! Let me out! Now!
Rachel?
No. How are ya Paul?
Okay. Chandler, did your dad ever hug you?
No, did he hug you?!
No! No! It's just that, my dad never did. I miss my dad.
Well, you can see my dad in Vegas kissing other dads.
Hey Chandler?
Yeah?
Would you.......Would you hug me?
I'm a little busy here Paul.
That's exactly what my dad used to say!
Okay, a quick one. Come on hug it out. Oh hey! There you go. Okay.
Five more seconds.
Okay!
Hey!
Joey!
Whoa-whoa-hey-hey! Hi, Paul is it?
Do you have my credit card?
Yes, it's in my... In...in my pocket. My back pocket! My back pocket!
Thank God!
Oh hey listen I got us tickets to a Knicks game tonight.
Oh, I can't go.
Come on! It'll be fun! Me, you, and Ross, and... Paul probably...
Chandler, I found the perfect ring.
Oh, that's uh, that's pretty nice but I'm gonna go with the one I picked first.
Oh my God Chandler, the one you picked is gone. It's over!
What?
Some guy bought it. I'm sorry. I tired to stop it but they put me in jail!
They put you in jail?
The little jail between the doors!
Phoebe, I asked you to guard the ring!
I know, I'm sorry! But y'know, this ring is better! Monica never even saw the other ring.
Yeah but when he proposed to me with the ring I got goose bumps.
Maybe it was the guy.
It was the ring!
Hey! So uh, was he excited about the tickets?
No! He blew us off!
What?!
I know!
I can't believe it. Can I tell you something? I'm a little mad at him now.
Can I tell you something? Me too.
Y'know what? He didn't want to talk to us about being angry, well maybe we don't talk to him at all!
Ooooh! Freeze him out.
That's right!
I like it!
Eh? We'll show him!
From now on, it's gonna be Joey and Ross, best friends. Okay! We're gonna be the new Joey and Chandler.
Hi. I'm back.
Hey! I have so much more to tell ya, I've written it all down!
Ah that's great. No actually that's... That's great! That's really great! Y'know, I gotta tell ya writing, I mean writing, gets me uh, gets me kinda hot.
Wait! Wait! Listen! Listen to this! Y'know what I wanted to be when I was that age?
A lover?
A surfer.
Oh yeah surfer?
I wanted to be one with the waves, y'know?
Okay, hold on real quick, hold on a second let me just uh, get a little more comfortable here. Wait, now wait a second, this isn't too revealing is it?
No. What ever happened to that little dude. So full of dreams...
I don't care about the little dude! I can't! I cannot listen to anymore of this! Y'know, the only person who would want to listen to this is a mental health professional! And then it's only because they get paid $100 an hour! Do you know how much money I could've made listening to you? $2,000! And do you know when I figured that out? While you were talking!
What?! I can't believe you're trying to stifle me! When just 14 hours ago we figured out that that is exactly what my mother was trying to do to me!
Oh... I'm sorry. I... I-I don't mean-I didn't mean to stifle you. I... This is all just a little overwhelming.
Oh Rachel, I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to overwhelm you. It's just that, when those gates open, you... Hard to close 'em. But they are closed now. Believe me.
I'm so glad, I'm so glad you shared. And I'm glad that you're done. What do you say we umm...
I would really like that.
That was...so good.
Hey.
I can't believe I let you talk me into buying this stupid gumball machine looking ring!
It's not a stupid gumball machine looking ring! It's a beautiful ring!
No, it's not! When I looked at the other ring I could see Monica's face when I gave it to her, y'know? And I could see her saying yes. When I look at this ring, all I see is a ring! Unless I look at it really closely and then I can see my own eye. Look, this is the most important thing I'm gonna do in my life. I wanna make sure it's perfect.
Okay. There may be a way that we can get the other ring back. 'Cause I heard the guy tell the jeweler where he was going to propose. So maybe we can get him to trade rings or something.
I can't do that.
Well you certainly can't give her that stupid gumball ring.
There he is!
Okay and he hasn't proposed yet because she has no ring on her finger.
Wow! You're good! After this, we should solve crimes.
Yeah! Okay, go, go, go get him.
Oh, okay. Excuse me sir? Could you come with me please? You have a phone call.
Who is it?
It is your office.
Do you know who at my office?
John?
Oh John! Great!
Here he is.
Hi! Hi. Okay, there was a slight mix-up at the jewelry store, the ring you're about to propose with was supposed to be held for me. So, I'm gonna need to have that back. But, in exchange I'm willing to trade you this beautiful, more expensive ring. Ew.
Wow! I would trade.
It is beautiful, but I'm gonna use this one. Now, if you'll excuse me.
No-no! This is my fiancee and her heart was set on that ring. You don't want to break her heart now do you?
Yeah, do you want to break a dying woman's heart?
You're dying?!
Yeah, she's dying... Of a cough apparently.
Yes, and it is my dying wish to have that ring. See, if I'm not buried with that ring then my spirit is going to wander the nether world for all eternity...
Okay, that's enough honey!
I don't know. Let me see the ring.
Great! Okay, here.
All right.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you! And you are about to marry a wonderful man! Hey! I'm marrying a dead woman!
Guys? I've got something important to tell ya. Guys? Guys?! I'm gonna ask Monica to marry me.
I think we gotta end the freeze out.
Wait a minute, is this, is this for real?
Yeah, check out the ring.
Oh my God!!
So you two are really serious?!
Yep, pretty much.
You-you're gonna get married?! I mean... We're gonna be brothers-in-law!
And-and-and-and-and-and, and we're gonna be friends again!
Heyyyy-What?
Oh it's water under the bridge, forget it!
Okay! I was gonna wait 'til uh, it was official y'know? But I got so excited I just had to tell you guys because you're my best friends.
I think I'm gonna cry!
Ugh! No more crying! Please! I just dumped one cry baby, I'll dump you too!
I'm gonna ask Monica to marry me.
Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh Chandler!! You guys are gonna be so happy!
I know.
Where's all the tissues?!
Check out the ring.
Nice! One and a half carat easy.
Hi.
Hey-hey Pheebs!
What?
Chandler's gonna ask Monica to marry him!
Oh I know, I helped pick out the ring.
You told her before you told us?
Well, she walked in when I was looking at the ring brochures. You can understand that, right? Guys? Guys?
God that is the most beautiful engagement ring ever!
Yeah? Well, you should know. You've bought like a billion of 'em.
Yeah, you didn't get one.
Okay, well tonight's the big night.
Yeah!
Okay listen, how are you gonna ask her?
It is going to be perfect. I am taking her to her favorite restaurant. I'm going to get her a bottle of the champagne that she really loves; therefore knows how expensive it is. Then when the glasses are full, instead of proposing a toast I'm just gonna propose.
Ohh...
That sounds perfect!
Yeah.
You're gonna mess it up let me do it.
I'm not gonna mess it up.
If she says no, can I have the ring?
She's not gonna say no.
If!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hi Monica.
Give me it!
It's gone.
Phoebe!
Hey!
Hi Monica.
We're practically kissing.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey Rach!
Are any of you guys free tonight? My boss is hosting this charity event for underprivileged kids and the more people I bring, the better I look. So, Monica? Chandler?
Well, Monica and Chandler can't go. We're going to dinner remember?!
Oh my God, I'm so sorry.
What's the big deal?
I just get mad when Rachel doesn't remember where we're going.
Where are you going?
How about you guys?
Open bar?
I think so.
I can do that for the kids.
Hey, y'know what? I'll come too. I'm making money now; it's about time I give something back.
Well, you could also give back the money you owe me.
Okay. Have a benefit.
Hey!
Hey! Ross, listen can you come to a charity event tonight?
Oh no, I have plans with Elizabeth.
Oh, so you're already doing your part for the kids.
I'm sorry, it's just one of my last nights together before she leaves for camp-to be a counselor!
Ross let me ask you a question. All jokes aside, where is this relationship going?
Wait a minute, all jokes aside? I didn't agree to that!
Do you really see this as a long-term thing?
I don't know.
Y'know, you are 12 years older than her.
Wait a minute, does-does everyone feel this way?
Yeah! Yeah, sort of. I'm sorry.
Uh-uh-Wow! Uh, I thought you guys were just like making jokes, I had no idea. What you know what? You guys are wrong. Uh yes, there is a chronological age difference but I never notice it. You know why? Because she is very mature. Besides, it doesn't really matter to me what you guys think. I mean, I'm the one dating Elizabeth, not you!
That's not what she said last night.
See? Now, he could date her.
Will you marry me? Will you marry me? Hey, you marry me! What's going on little elves?
It's the big night! We wanted to wish you good luck!
Yeah, yeah you have the ring?
Yeah, right here in my pocket. Pheebs?
Oh! Oop!
Okay, now will you guys get out of here? I want this is to be a surprise and she's gonna know.
Yeah-yeah you guys. Get out of here!
Hi guys.
You are beautiful.
Oh, thank you! What's going on?
We're just really...very excited about this charity event that we have to go to.
Here.
Oh! Thank you!
So now what's going on here?
Uh well, uh this is a silent auction. They lay out all the stuff here and then you write down your offer and then the highest bid gets it.
No, I know what a silent is I meant, what's going on with your hair?
Uh, wh-why?
No! It's nice!
Nice to see you Rachel.
Oh, hi!
So glad you brought someone.
Someone? I brought people. Mr. Thompson, this is Phoebe. Phoebe, this is Mr. Thompson. He's the head of my department.
Oh, hi.
And I also brought my friend Joey...
Oh!! Shrimp toast!
Well, y'know I-I don't know where he is.
Well, I hope you're gonna bid on some things Rachel.
Well, y'know what? Actually, I was about to bid on this lovely trip to Paris.
Ohh, nice choice.
Yeah.
Good luck.
Thank you. Okay, twenty dollars.
Shut the door! Shut the door!!
What's-what's going on?
The guys across the hall are throwing water balloons at us.
Oh, you have to call the police! That's what I did to the kids in my building!
No, it's a water balloon fight! We started it!
Oh! Listen umm, I, I just stopped by to see if you wanted to see this play tonight. Umm, it's supposed to be excellent. The director is the same...
Who drank all the Kamikazes?
Nobody! We put them in here!
You want some?!
No! Okay! Okay! Okay, look, can I, can I just-just talk to you for a second?
Yeah, sure.
Uh, so this play umm, what do you think? It's-it's gotten great reviews! Y'know the uh...
Attack!
Put your balloons down!
You put your balloons down!!
You put your balloons down!!
Everybody put their balloons down!!! Now this is a nice suit!!
Our next item is the romantic trip to Paris. It goes to Emil Alexander high a high bid of 2,300.
Ugh! So close!
Hey you guys! Look!
Hey!
I got me some drinks!
What are you doing?
Open bar!
Well now it's an empty bar.
You just can't stand anyone else enjoying themselves can't you?
And finally, our biggest item of the night, the 22-foot gentleman's day sailer sailboat. The winning bid was a whooping $20,000!
I won! That was my guess!
What?! What?! What?!
I guessed 20,000!
Joey! It is an auction! You don't guess, you buy!
What?! I don't have 20,000!
Congratulations on your new boat, Joey Tribbiani!!
Joey! Sit down!
Forget her! You enjoy this!!
What are you doing?
One nation, under God. Indivisible with liberty and justice for all. I remembered it. The champagne is here.
Are you okay?
Yes! Yes! I'm good! Are you good? Are you good? Is everything-are you-are you perrr-perfect?!
Yeah. I'm okay. I'm actually-I'm a little cold, can I have your jacket?
Oh, yeah. Uh, no you can't have my jacket! Because then I would be cold! If you thought that you were going to be cold, you should've brought your own jacket. But uh, other than that, are you okay? Are you okay?
Are you sure you're okay?
Yes! I'm fine. In fact I've been fine for a long time now and I think, the reason is you.
Ohh that's sweet!
Okay umm, before I meant you I had really little life and I couldn't imagine growing old with...
Oh my God!
I know, but just let me say it.
Oh my God, Richard.
What?! I'm Chandler! Oh, that's Richard!
Oh God, maybe he won't see us. Richard!
Monica! Chandler!
Hey-hey, hey! I don't know why I did that!
Hey, it's good to see you!
You too, you let uh, your hair grow long.
Yeah-Oh that's right. You, you always wanted me too. Hey, I see you got your mustache back.
Well, my nose got lonely.
And uh, you don't have a mustache which is good. I'm Chandler; I make jokes when I'm uncomfortable.
Hi, I'm Lisa.
Hi.
Oh, I'm sorry. Lisa, Monica, Chandler. We used to date.
Richard! No one supposed to know about us! See I, did it again.
Chandler, wh-why don't we sit down?
Yeah, I'll sit down.
It's good to see you
You're table's ready sir.
Oh. Good to see you guys.
Yes.
Or if you prefer, this table is available.
That might be fun.
What were you thinking?!
I didn't know it was an auction!
Wh?!
I figured, take a guess, help a charity, free boat!
Why would a charity give away a free boat?!
I don't know! Charity?
Ugh!
Well, just buy the damn boat!
Phoebe, don't you think you've had enough to drink?
I'm just helping the kids!
How is you drinking helping the kids?
Because the more I drink, the less there is for the kids to drink.
Mr. Tribbiani.
Oh hi!
Your generous contribution brings us a big step closer to building the youth center.
Just out of curiosity, how-how much is that boat worth?
I think it was valued at 19,000
Hey, I was pretty close. Uhh, so bad news. Umm, I can't buy the boat, I don't have any money.
Joey! Joey, good one!
That's good. Very good!
So uh listen, I think I'm gonna take off now.
Hey! You...can't...leave Joey! You agreed to buy that boat, all right?! That is a contract! And plus if you leave, my boss is gonna kill me!
Well, what am I gonna do Rach?! I don't have that kind of money!
I know. Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. All right, this is what we're gonna do, we are gonna go to the next highest bidder, and we are just gonna let them buy it, and then you're just gonna pay the difference.
Okay.
Okay.
Look, I don't know why the kids need a youth center anyway! Y'know? They should just watch TV after school like I did and I turned out fine!
Not great.
And so, we're hiding in the bathroom.
And-and then I sneak out and before Monica can her parents come in.
So I hide in the shower and the next thing you know they're going at it right on the bathroom floor.
Oh my God!
I got a good one, I got a good one! I once walked in on both my parents making love to the same guy.
It's so great seeing you guys again. I'd like to make a toast. Uh, as a poet once said, "In the sweetness of friendship, let there be laughter and sharing of pleasures for in the due of little things the heart finds it's morning and is refreshed."
Ohh.
What?!
Oh my God, you guys!!
Before you say anything, have we got a story for you! Guess who we bumped into at dinner!
Who?
Richard!
What? A-ohh! Ohh. Oh that's right that's right. That's Richard's favorite place too.
Oh you knew that. Good!
I thought you were going out with Elizabeth.
Yeah, I was but uh, she was a little busy with a water balloon fight.
Oh Ross, sometimes grown-ups have commitments they just can't get out of!
Y'know, maybe she is too young for me. Y'know, when I was over there and she was running around with her friends, I felt like I was a baby-sitter. I finally started to see what you guys were talking about. I don't know what to do.
Why don't you just weigh out the good stuff about the relationship against the bad stuff. I mean that's what I did when I first weighing stuff.
Okay umm, bad stuff. Well, I'm-I'm 12 years older than she is.
If the school finds out you're fired.
Hmm.
She's leaving for three months.
For camp!
Okay, good stuff. Umm, well she's-she's sweet and pretty and...
Look Ross, the only question you need to ask is, "Do you see a future?" I mean like do you see yourself marrying her? Oh my God! You did it already! You married her, didn't you?!
No! No! I...didn't do that. It's just... Okay, honestly no. I don't, I don't see a big future with her.
Okay well I think...that's your answer.
I've got to talk to her. Ugh, I hate this part.
Hey, you have to forget about Elizabeth. I mean if you're not careful you may not get married at all this year!
Rach! Rachel! Okay, the next highest bidder is at table one.
Oh great!
Oh and uh the guy who got the Paris trip is at table four.
Oh, okay.
Why do you care about the guy who won the Paris trip?
It's a trip for two! Excuse me. Excuse me, is the person who won the Paris trip at this table?
That was me.
Oh, en chante.
Uhh, excuse me is there a Mr. Bowmont at this table?
That's me.
Ahh, yes.
Oh well, hello. This is your lucky day Mr. Bowmont, the uh gentleman day sailer as just become available again and I believe that you made a bid of $18,000.
You-you have to pay that! It's not just a guess.
Okay. Okay.
I was actually relieved uh I didn't win the boat. My wife would've killed me.
Ohh...
Are you kidding me?! She's gonna this boat!
Y-Yeah! What-what is your wife's name?
It's Pam.
Pam! Oh God okay, just imagine this, "The Pam."
Aw-awww!
I don't think she'd like that.
Okay, uh-uh imagine this, "The Mr. Bowmont."
Oooooh...
I don't think so dear.
Okay look, let me paint you a little picture. All right, you are settin' sail up the Hudson! You've got the wind in your h--arms! You-you get all that peace and quiet that you've always wanted! You get back to nature! You can go fishin'! You can-ooh, you can get one of those little hats and have people call you captain, and then when you're old, Cappy.
What the hell, it's for a good cause! All right!
No way! It's mine!!
What?! What?!
All that stuff you just said? I want that!
But Joey you don't have $20,000!
Who cares?! I-I'll make payments, whatever it takes, I want the Mr. Bowmont!!
Oh my God, you're back!
Ohh, let me see it! Let me see your hand!
Why do you want to see my hand?
I wanna see what's in your hand. I wanna see the trash.
Yeah.
Eww! Oh, it's all dirty. You should throw this out.
Okay.
What did you guys just do?!
What happened?
Richard was there so I couldn't do it!
What?! Noooo...
I'm gonna do it tomorrow y'know, and-and surprise her, but now you've ruined it!
We didn't ruin it!
Who walks into a room and asks to see a person's hands?!
Well, a palm reader, a manicurist, a hand doctor...
Glove salesman!
Good one! Yeah.
This is terrible. What am I going to do?
Look, she only suspects something okay? She doesn't know for sure, so just throw her off the track.
That's right, I can throw her off. I can make her think marriage is the last thing on my mind.
Yeah! Yeah! Convince her that-that you're scared of commitment! Convince her that you're a little coward!
I can do that, I've had 30 years of practice.
Hey, being you is finally gonna pay off!
I had to go all the way to the basement because some idiot keeps stuffing the trash chute with pizza boxes!
That guy's still doing that?!
Hey! Oh my God you're here, let me see your hand!!
No, you're too late!!! She already took out the trash!!!
Wow! I have never had such a healthy break-up! She was such a grown-up about it! She didn't seem too immature for me! Did I just make a huge mistake?
Ross! Wait!
Elizabeth, thank God! I was just thinking about...
You suck!!
What?!
Okay, break-up's still on!
Okay, okay, here she comes! How do I look? Do I look like a guy who doesn't want to get married?
Yeah! And also, a little like a French guy. I never noticed that before.
Hi guys!
Hey!
Hey!
What are you up too?
Oh, just hanging out, talkin' about uh, websites. Yeah, we saw this really interesting website about marriage and how totally unnecessary it is and how its just a way for the government to keep tabs on you.
Yeah, Big Brother.
Well that's a little crazy. Although I am y'know glad to hear that you're branching out on what you look at on the Internet.
Yeah, well... Y'know, it just got me thinking though, why would anybody ever want to get married huh?
Why?! To celebrate your relationship! To solidify your commitment! To declare your love for one another to the world!
Eh...
Okay well that's good to know.
The Mr. Bowmont's here!!!
Hey Monica, there's a customer who wants to complement the chef, should I let him in?
Sure, I love this part!
Come on in.
Hi!
Richard!
Actually, I'm not here to complement the chef.
Ohh... Oh, that's okay I hate when people come back to complement the chef. Like I have nothing better to do! So what's up?
Well, it was great seeing you the other night.
Oh, good to see you too. Did you come down here to tell me that?
No! I came here to tell you something else. I came here to tell you I still love you.
What uh-What did you-What?!
I still love you. And I know I probably shouldn't even be here telling you this, I mean you're with Chandler a guy I really like, and if you say he's straight I'll believe you! After seeing ya the other night I knew if I didn't tell ya I'd regret it for the rest of my life. Letting you go was the stupidest thing I ever did.
Y'know you're really not supposed to be back here!
Well yeah, I'm sorry. I know this is the wrong time and the wrong place but I had to tell ya! I wanna spend my life with you. I wanna marry you. I wanna have kids with you.
Oh God... Why don't they put chairs back here?!
I know this is crazy but am I too late?
What the... Yes you're too late! Where was all this three years ago?!
Well I know I was an idiot! And I tried to forget you, I really did! Y'know after we had lunch last year I spent six months in Africa trying to get you out of my head!
What were you doing in Africa?
Working with blind kids.
Ohhh! What are you doing to me?! Oh look, I-I... I'm sorry but umm, this-this-this-this is not going to happen.
Okay that's fine, I'll walk away. And I'll never bother you again, but only if you tell me Chandler's willing to give you everything I am.
Well he is! Yeah, I mean marriage is all he talks about! My goodness, in fact, I'm the one that's making him wait!
You are?
Yeah!
Why?
Why? Because of the government.
Isn't it incredible?! Monica and Chandler, gettin' married.
I know, they're gonna be so happy together.
Ohh... I mean two best friends falling in love, how often does that happen?
Not that often!
No! I'm so happy for them!
Me too! So happy for them!
I'm so happy and not at all jealous.
Oh no! No God, definitely not jealous!
I mean I'm probably 98% happy, maybe 2% jealous. And I mean what's 2%? That's nothing.
Totally. I'm like 90/10.
Yeah me too.
Hey uh, have you guys scene Chandler?
Wh-no, but y'know who did stop in here looking for ya, Tennille.
So that marriage stuff that you were saying yesterday, you don't really believe that do you?
Sure I do. In fact, I think the whole concept of marriage is unnatural. I mean look at pigs. Let's take a second here and look at pigs. Okay pigs don't mate for life. I mean a pig can have like a hundred sexual partners in a lifetime, and that's just an ordinary pig not even a pig that's good at sports!
Yeah, but that's pigs not people!
If marriage worked, I'd be all for it. But do you know what the divorce rate in this country is? 97%.
Wait a minute. Are you honestly telling me that-that you may never want to get married?
Well, never say never but y'know probably uh yeah, never.
Oh my God! Then-then-then what are we even doing?! What is this?!
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What is all this pressure?! Is this some new kind of strategy? Why don't you put down your copy of 'The Rules' huh mantrap?!
Y'know what?! I gotta go! Ugh!
It's okay, I got a plan.
We're gonna find love!
Definitely!
Yeah, I'm pretty confident about that. That's what makes it so easy for me to be 80% happy for Monica and Chandler! It would be nice to have a little guarantee though.
What do you mean?
Well y'know, some people make deals with a friend, like if neither of them are married by the time they're 40, they marry each other.
You mean a backup?
Exactly!
Yeah, yeah I got that.
You do?
Hm-mmm.
Who?
Joey.
Joey?!
Yeah!
Are you serious?!
Yeah, I locked him years ago!
Wh... So... If neither of you are married by the time you're 40, you're gonna marry Joey.
Yep, we shook on it. Yeah but believe me that is not how he wanted to seal the deal.
Oh, seriously?
Ohh, yeah. I think his exact words were...
Charming.
Well hey, it's just a backup.
Yeah.
Hey Monica!
Have you seen Rachel? Or a mirror?
This is for my boat, pretty cool huh?
Yeah, it's great.
Whoa-whoa, what's the matter?! Talk to the captain!
I'm just having one of those days where you realize you're in a dead-end relationship!
Chandler giving you a hard time huh?
It's not like I want to get married tomorrow! It's just that I-I'd like to believe that I'm in a relationship that's actually going somewhere, that I'm not just wasting my time!
Well, you know Chandler.
No I don't know Chandler! Not anymore! It's like it's like something's changed.
Maybe you changed?
I didn't change!
Maybe that's the problem.
What?!
Chandler is a complex fellow, one who is unlikely to take a wife.
Is that some kind of boat talk?
I don't know! I haven't totally decided how to talk on my boat yet.
What does he think? Does he think I'm just gonna wait around for nothing?
Monica face it, Chandler is against marriage. And-and always will be!
Well there's some people who do want to marry me.
There are?
Yeah! Richard!
R-R-Richard said he wants to marry you?! And-and Chandler's tellin' ya how much he hates marriage?!
That's right.
Chandler loves marriage!!
You just told me that he hates marriage! That-that he's a-a complex fellow who's unlikely to take a wife! That-that he's against marriage and always will be!
You got that from what I said?!
When the Cretaceous period ended, the dinosaurs were gone.
What happened you guys?
Rach!
Hey you!
Hey, come on in.
Oh thank you. Hey y'know, I'm so sorry to hear about you and Elizabeth.
Oh, thanks. Yeah, I really thought we'd be able to make it work, but uh, I guess it just wasn't meant to be.
Yeah, love. It's a tricky business isn't it?
I guess so.
So what do you say we make a pact? If you and I are both single by the time we're 40, we get married. I mean, we know each other, we like each other, and we've-we've already slept together so y'know there'll be no surprises there! You know what I mean? No like, "What's that?!"
Right. Ohh! You-you want me to be your backup.
Exactly.
Ohh, yeah I already have one.
What? Who?
Phoebe.
Phoebe?! Wait a-but-but she just, she said that Joey was her backup.
Ohh, I don't think so.
Ross! I just had a conversation with her, and she said that she and Joey made a deal!
That's impossible! I mean we have had a deal for years! We-we-we shook on it, although believe me she wanted to do a lot more than that.
Where the hell have you been?!
I was making a coconut phone with the professor.
Richard told Monica he wants to marry her!
What?!
Yeah! Yeah, I've been trying to find ya to tell to stop messing with her and maybe I would have if these damn boat shoes wouldn't keep flying off!
My-Oh my God!
I know! They suck!!
He's not supposed to ask my girlfriend to marry him! I'm supposed to do that!
I know!
Well what... Y'know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna go over there; I'm gonna kick his ass! Will you help me?!
Look, Chandler I don't think us getting our asses kicked is a solution. Okay? Just go and find Monica!
You're right.
Yeah!
Okay. I'm gonna get the ring! I'm gonna get the ring! I'm gonna go find her and I'm just going to propose!
Okay.
Okay great.
Dude-dude-dude!
What?!
Let me know about that coconut phone, it might great for the boat.
Hi.
Hi.
I don't know why I'm here.
I didn't ask. You wanna come in?
I don't know.
Oh, okay. Well, I'll just leave the door open and go sit on the couch.
Chandler is such an idiot!
Drink?
Yeah, I'll have a scotch...
...on the rocks with a twist? I remember.
Still smoking cigars?
Uh, no! No! That's...art! If it bothers you I can put my art out.
No that's, that's okay.
So Monica let me ask you a question. Y'know, since we broke up do you ever, think about me?
Uh yeah, I-I actually I thought about you a couple months ago.
Oh really?
Yeah but it was because I-I had an eye exam and I don't like my new eye doctor.
Who is it?
Edward Nevski?
Yeah he's no good. Do you ever think about me in a non-eye doctor way?
No.
Ahh.
But getting over was the hardest thing that I've ever had to do. And I never let myself think about you.
Phoebe! You picked Joey and Ross?! You can not have two backups!
Of course I can! It's just good sense to backup your backup! Look, I've already lost Chandler!
What?!
Hey!
Hey!
Phoebe! We're both your backup?!
Phoebe, how could you do this to me?!
I don't-Look I don't know what you're complaining about now? You were both aware of the situation!
No we weren't!
I was not!
Okay, this kind of back talk is not gonna fly when we're married!
Phoebe you can't have both of them! You have to pick one!
Pick me!!
No! Pick me! I don't want to end up an old maid!
All right well let's see, Ross is a good father, but Joey has a boat-This is hard!
This is crazy! Hey look, I wanna switch to Rachel!
Ooh, I wanna switch to Rachel too!
No wait! Just-Okay-Just wait! You guys! Wait you guys! Don't make any rash decisions, okay? Just remember my promise, when we get married, three times a week.
Oh God, Phoebe!
I'm talking about massages.
Oh.
Okay, y'know what?! I know-I know how to settle this! All right here, this is what we're gonna do! I'm gonna write Joey on one napkin and I'm gonna right Ross on the other napkin and we are going to pick one! And that person is going to be our backup! Okay?
Okay that's fair.
All right.
Good!
Pick one.
Left! Thank you.
You're welcome.
Ross!
Joey! We should just switch.
Yeah absolutely!
Yeah.
I missed you-you ugly, flat faced old freak!
Excuse me?
Oh! Him.
Oh. Whew!
I missed this apartment! Now, this is a grown-up's apartment! Y'know, I-I should be with a grown-up, do you know what I mean?!
Yeah! You're saying, you need to be with someone more mature. Maybe someone with, a license to practice medicine. Or a mustache.
Y'know, let's face it, I'm not a kid anymore! I-I need to be with someone who-who wants the same things that I do! I mean coming to my place of work and telling me that you love me, I want that! Talking about pig sex over lunch, I don't want that!
I think that's fair.
Fair? Please don't even talk to me about fair! Fair would've been you wanting to marry me back then! Or fair would've been Chandler wanting to marry me now! Believe me, nothing about this is fair! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing!
It's okay! Shh! Hey. Hey. Shhhh.
Nothing. I don't kn-Umm. I don't know. Umm...
I know.
Y'know, I-I... I have to figure...some st-Y'know, some stuff before I can...
Yeah, I understand. Take as much time as you want. Ten, even twenty minutes if you need it. I'll be here. Not smoking.
Chandler.
Where is she? I'm not scared of you!
She's not here and please come in.
Scotch on the rocks, with a twist, on a coaster? Ha-ha, Monica! Monica!
Okay, she was here, but she left.
Well where did she go?
Well she said she had to think things over.
Oh my God, I can't believe this! Y'know, I thought...I thought you were a good guy.
Oh, hey look nothing happened.
Nothing happened? Nothing? So you didn't tell my girlfriend that you love her?
Well all right, one thing happened?
Y'know what? I can't believe this! Do you know what you did? My girlfriend is out there thinking things over! You made my girlfriend think!!
Well I'm sorry.
And what does she have to think about? I love her!
Well, apparently I'm willing to offer her things that you are not.
But I am willing to offer her all those things. This was just a plan, y'know? A way to throw her off course so that when I offered her all these things, she'd be surprised!
Well if it helps, it worked very well.
It was working until you showed up, you big tree! I mean, this isn't fair. You had your chance with her! You had your chance and you blew it! And this is my chance and I am not going to blow it because we are meant for each other! And this is all just been one stupid mistake! I was gonna propose tonight.
You were gonna propose?
Yeah I even got a ring. Did you get a ring?
No I don't have a ring! You go get her Chandler. And can I give you a piece of advice? If you do get her, don't let her go. Trust me.
Y'know Richard...you are a good guy.
I know. I hate that!
Dude!
I can't talk to you now, I gotta find Monica!
She's gone.
What?
She's gone. She had a bag and she left.
What are you talking about?
She was all crying. She-she said you guys want different things, and that and that she needed time to think.
Well why didn't you stop her?! Why didn't you just tell her it was a plan?!
I-I did! I told her everything, Chandler! But she wouldn't believe me.
Well where... Where did she go?
To her parent's I think and she said you shouldn't call her. But if I were you I would.
I can't believe I ruined this.
I am so sorry man.
You wanted it to be a surprise.
Oh my God.
Chandler... In all my life... I never thought I would be so lucky. As to...fall in love with my best...my best... There's a reason why girls don't do this!
Okay! Okay! Okay! Oh God, I thought... Wait a minute, I-I can do this. I thought that it mattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thing that matters is that you, you make me happier than I ever thought I could be. And if you'll let me, I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way. Monica, will you marry me?
Yes.
I knew you were likely to take a wife!
Can we come it yet?! We're dying out here!
Come in! Come in! We're engaged!!!
Ohhh, this is the least jealous I've ever been!
Oh no wait no, this is wrong! Ross isn't here!
Oh...
Oh hell, he's done this three times! He knows what its about!
Yeah!
