Oh, the way you crushed Mike at ping pong was such a turn-on.You wanna...?
You know, I'd love to, but I'm a little tired.
I'll put a pillowcase over my head.
You're on!
Hey!
What's up?
Well, okay, Mike's taking a shower, which by the way there's no law against. And then we're gonna grab some food, so if you want...
... finally...
Is that Ross?
Yeah, you can hear everything through these stupid walls.
Sounds like he's with someone.
He could be alone. This morning I heard him do push-ups, and then talk to his triceps.
Wait a minute, I think Phoebe's right. You know I hear someone else in there with him.
Ooh... Dr. Geller!
God, you're amazing... I didn't even have to ask you to call me that.
Oh my God, that's Charlie!
She's cheating on Joey with Ross!
Oh that tart... floozy... giant...
I'm not sure about this.
Yeah, you're right. This is none of our business.
No I'm not sure that it's the best way to hear everything. Someone get me a glass!
Oh, I'm not gonna do this, okay? I'm not gonna eavesdrop on my friend.
Ooh... I love Barbados!
Ooh... I can't believe I'm kissing you. I'm kissing Rachel!
I know, I'm her!
Rachel and Joey! It's Rachel and Joey!!!
What?
Get over here!
ooh...
Wow!
Oh my God, I love how thin these walls are!
Thank you.
Hey, you know, before you said that nothing could happen between us? What changed?
Well, I only said that because of Ross, you know. Then I saw him kissing Charlie...
What? Ross and Charlie? Wow! She's really making her way through the group, huh? Ah, who am I to talk?
I can't believe this. Rachel and Joey?
How about the dinosaur twins in the other room? No-one is manning that wall!
I'm on it!
Anything?
I think I hear curtains closing...
We've got shoes being kicked off over here.
Bedsprings, unmistakable!
You do realise that's your brother?
Not until you said it. Somebody switch! Wait a minute... Ross and Charlie, Joey and Rachel, Phoebe and Mike! We're the only people leaving with the same person we came with.
That's not true. I came with Monica and I'm leaving with Weird Al.
Okay, I've had it with the hair jokes. Tomorrow morning, before we leave, I'm going to the salon.
Okay Buckwheat!
You gotta hear this, it's great... It's like free porn!
Weh...*sigh*
uhm... Is everything okay?
Yeah, It's just... I don't think I can do this...
Ooh... Is it because of what might be on the bedspread, because I saw that news report too, with the infra red and the ... I could just...
No, NO! Look, I need to talk to Joey. I mean, you guys just broke up. Before anything more happens between us, I need to know he's okay with it.
I uhm... I completely understand.
Alright, I'm gonna go find them... I just need a... need a before I can... you know. Grandma... grandma... grandma... Okay, I see you later.
Okay...
That's the door. He's gone...
And she's... turning on the TV... and watching... Miss Congeniality!
Honey, if you know it through a wall, you know it too well!
Hey, what are you guys doing?
Oh, we're just... we're sad to go so we're just saying goodbye to the hotel. I love you... Paradise Hotel, Golf resort and Spa...
Yeah, we had a great time, thank you!
Bye!
Okay, uhm... Hey, you guys seen Joey anywhere?
He's probably in his room with his current girlfriend Charlie. That's the situation as we know it...
Well, if you see him could you please tell him I'm looking for him?
You got it!
Thanks! Thank you!
Other wall, people! Other wall!
Rach, you there?
Oh my God, it's Ross. What are we gonna do?
Oh, ju-ju-just stay calm. Just be calm. For all he knows we're just hanging out together. Right? Just be nonchalant. That's not nonchalant!
No idea what it means.
Oh... okay, just hide!
Rach?
Coming! Try under the bed, try under the bed!
There's no room under the bed.
Is everything okay?
Yeah...
Hey.
Hi...
You know where Joey is?
...I really don't...
Can I talk to you for a minute?
Yeah, sure...
I don't believe this... Have you guys been...
Shhh... This is the listening side of the wall.
And then she told me that she and Joey had broken up, and that part of the reason was that she had feelings for me.
Uh-huh... right... yeah...
And you know I wanted to ask Charlie out since the day I met her.
Oh, I know... I know it's been really hard for you.
Anyway, one thing lead to another, and... oh... before you know it, we were kissing. I mean, how angry do you think Joey is gonna be?
That is hard to say, Ross. That is hard to say.
You know, I gotta go find him. He's gotta be here someplace.
You would think!
Joey!
Is he gone?
How are you doing this?
Pssst...
How... wha... Hey! What are you... What is this? Have you guys been listening this entire time?
YE-AH!
Now, what is this?
Ah, what is this? Well, lets see, we kissed for ten minutes and now we're talking to our friends about it, so I guess this is sixth grade!
Oh no... Have you thought about it how complicated this could get? What about Ross?
Well, he's with Charlie now.
Yeah, but he wants to talk to you before anything really happens with her. And as his friend, I mean, don't you think he deserves the same from you?
You're a pain in my ass, Geller!
All right, look you guys... Look, we appreciate all the advice, but this is between Joey and me and I think we can handle it...
Okay, well we'll go back in there, but will you do one thing for us? The people that care about you?
Sure...
Enunciate!
Get out!
Are they right?
Probably, yeah... I mean, maybe we should... hold off until we talk to Ross.
Yeah... Yeah, we can wait, we don't have to do anything tonight.
Yeah, I think that'd be best... So, so I'm gonna... I'm gonna take off...
Although...
I like although!
I mean, you know... Ross and I haven't dated in like... six years...
Six years? Wow... It's almost as long as highschool...
Plus, you know, he is with Charlie now.
Absolutely! He's not thinking about you.
No...
I'm thinking about you...
Yeah...
Let's forget about Ross...
Forgotten.
What's wrong?
Nothing...
Seriously... What is it?
Nothing... It's really... It's nothing... Come here, come here...
What's wrong?
Sorry, I just uhm... I can't seem to get Ross out of my head...
Well, maybe I can help.
Ooh, your lips are so soft... Do that again...
Yeah... we really need to talk to Ross...
Yeah.
Hey!
Hey!
You guys ready to go?
Not quite. Monica's still at the salon, and I'm just finishing packing.
Dude! You're not taking your Bible?
You're not supposed to take that. Besides, it's a New Testament, what are you gonna do with it?
Learn about Jesus...
Hey!
So, did you talk to Joey?
Uh, no... no. I couldn't find him. I'm just gonna talk to him on the plane.
Yeah, sounds like a good idea... Dr. Geller!
Stop it!
PHD.
You're filthy!
Hey, have you guys seen Monica?
Uh, actually I think she went to the salon.
Oh yeah, oh, she went to the salon alright...
Check it out!
Who's day just got better? CHANDLER!
Hey!... aaaaaahhhh!
What do you think?
I think.... I think I can see your scalp.
Don't you just love it?
Ye... Yeah... Yeah... You got shellfish in your head.
It's so... something... You go girlfriend!
You've never said that in your life, have you?
Not once.
I thought so.
And listen to this...
What d'ya know... It's a treat for the eyes and the ears.
Whoo, whoo. Wow, it's uhm... kinda weird that I'm sitting next to Charlie after we broke up.
Yeah, it's almost if Air Barbados doesn't care about your social life.
Look, does someone mind switching to sit with Charlie?
Oh, I uh, I mean, I... dude, I spent the whole conference with Charlie.
I understand...
No, I'll do it.
Wish I could switch with someone. I really don't wanna sit with Allen Iverson over there.
Uhm... You know, once we're in the air and the captain turns off the seatbelt sign... you feel free to roam about my cabin...
You should be careful when checking your overhead bins, 'cause items may shift during...
Aaah... you're not good at this...
You don't have to go home tonight, do you?
No, I think I can come over. It's Saturday, right?
Oh...
What?
Uhm... I can't do anything tonight.
Why not?
I have a date.
You have a... You have a date? With who?
Oh, it's... my girlfriend.
You have... have a girlfriend?
Yeah... Well, when... you and I broke up I started seeing someone.
For how long?
Three months.
Three months? Okay... This is probably none of my business, but uhm, how long do you think you're gonna keep seeing her?
I'll tell her that it's over tonight at dinner. I promise.
Oh, okay... good. You do that. And then when you get home, maybe there'll be a special delivery package waiting for you.
Maybe I'll sign for it. Tear it open. Pull out the packing material...
You know what, we're gonna have sex. Let's just leave it there.
Right, I'm gonna go talk to Joey. I think this is the right time. He's always in a good mood after the flight attendant says "duty free".
Okay... Good luck.
Ross is coming over. I think now would be a really good time to talk to him.
I guess so. I'm just... really nervous.
Okay, well keep in mind that by the time you're done, they'll probably be serving dinner.
Ooh...
Still nervous?
I'm gonna get the lasagna.
Hey Rach...
Yeah!
Do you mind if I sit here for a sec.?
Yeah, yeah sure! Yeah!
Hey!
Hey!
So, I uhm... kinda need to talk to you about Charlie.
Yeah?
Okay, last night after you guys broke up... so sorry to hear about that, by the way... Well, Charlie and I were talking, and..., well...
You kissed.
Wha... What? What would give you that idea?
I saw you.
Yeah, we kissed, but... nothing else... nothing else happened, okay.
Ross, Ross, Ross... It's okay.
What?
It's okay. You know, I totally understand, alright? You guys, make way more sense than her and I ever did, you know. And... I want you to be happy.
Are you serious?
Yeah... Now I have something...
I am speachless... I mean the fact that you would put my happiness first like that. I mean, you're an incredible friend, you know that?
Oh... uh... look... before you...
No, I mean it. You are so loyal man, and selfless, and generous...
I am those things, yeah.
You know what? I know Chandler longer, so I always think of him as my best friend, but now... I may have to rethink some stuff...
Dude!
Hey, if there is ever, anything I can do for you...
I can't think of anything.
Thanks!
Yeah.
So hi!
Hi!
So you eh, you talked to Joey?
Ah, yeah. We had a really good talk.
Oh! That's great!
Yeah!
Oh, so everything's okay?
Oh, no, it's great. It's great. He is... He is an amazing guy.
Ah... Well, obviously I think so too.
Well, I'm so excited about this.
Really? Excited?
Are you kidding? I have had some very dirty dreams about this...
Excuse me! You didn't tell him, did you?
I couldn't. He was saying all these really nice things about me. I didn't want him to get mad and take 'em all back. I'm on a edge on Chandler.
Oh God! Alright, fine. You know what Joey, forget it. When we go back to New York, I will tell him.
Thank you. Yeah, I appreciate that.
Hi, Mike's place.
Hey, it's Mike.
Ooh, that was fast.
Oh, err... no, she's not here yet. You know, I think I'm just gonna take off and break up with her over the phone...
Yeah, you can't do that! Oh, come on Mike, strap on a pair.Why don't you just tell her that we got back together. You know, women appreciate honesty. We also appreciate gentle spanking once in a while. Just F.Y.I.
One more thing... There... might be a picture of Precious on my coffee table.
Her name is Precious? Is she a purebreed or did you pick her up at the pound?
Anyway, I just wanna give you a heads up.
Okay, oh and you know, if she gets upset, just scratch her tummy and give her a liver snout.
Hi, I'm Precious, who are you?
I... I'm Phoebe.
Phoebe? Mike's ex-girlfriend Phoebe, the love of his life? That Phoebe?
Enchante.
Oh, I can't wait for everyone at work to see these... Ow!
You go back to work tomorrow night, right?
Yeah!
So if you want people to see them, then by definition you're not having them taken out... say, at the break of dawn?
Well, if I had them taken out, then I wouldn't be able to do this. You like that, right?
What are you singing?
It's "Bolero" from "10".
It's "Ride of the Valkyries" from "Apocalypse Now"... See, Here's The Thing The corn rose were really a solution to your frizzy hair problem. And now that we're home, we don't have that problem anymore, so if you think about it... I hate them!
You what? You said you liked them.
Did I? Let's refresh. I believe what I said was that I could see your scalp.
Fine, so you don't like them. Everybody else does.
Again, let's journey back... As I recall what Rachel said, was she had never notice the shape of your skull before. And Joey... Well, Joey didn't realise that there was anything different.
You know what? I don't care. I like it like this, and I'm gonna keep it. You're just jealous because your hair can't do this... OUCH!
Hit yourself in the tooth?
And the eye!
Hi... There she is. Hi Emma. Oh my God, I missed you. Oh Emma, I missed you so much. Hey... Did you have a good time with grandma Green? Huh? Did she give you a bottle of anti-depressants again to use as a rattle?
That was one time, Ross, and they were only like 5 milligrams.
Ooh hey, Emma, daddy has some presents for you okay? Okay? I want you to wait right here. Come here sweetie.
Aaah... Ross, actually there's something that I really need to talk to you about.
Okay, shoot!
Okay, uhm... alright, here's the deal.
OH NO!
What? What is it?
Oh, major shampoo explosion!
Uh, look Ross, this really isn't easy.
Oh, it's all over everything. Why? Why me?
Because you took three hundred bottles of shampoo?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You were saying?
Well, yeah... Okay, look it's about me and...
Oh, not another one! Oh my G... And this is moisturiser. It's even harder to clean! Why? Why do bad things happen to good people?
Wow! Well, clearly this is not a good time.
Duh, you think?
Okay, bye. Alright, so Mike's on his way over. See, you thought you guys were meeting here, and he thought you were meeting at the restaurant, so you know... Doesn't really matter who's right or wrong. Point is... I'm gonna take off.
I'm not letting you leave until you tell me what's going on here. I mean, are you guys getting back together or something?
Alright... Susie, can I call you Susie?
My name is Precious.
Yeah, I can't say that. uhm... Susie, I'm gonna be straight with you... Mike and I are back together... and uhm... unfortunately that effectively ends your relationship with him. And he's very sorry about that and wishes you the best of luck in all your endeavours.
I just can't believe this... Why?
Well, I don't...
Oh, why would he do this? I mean, what's wrong with me?
Nothing, there's nothing wrong with you.
I mean, what the hell am I supposed to do now?
Damn it woman, pull yourself together! Have some pride, for the love of God.
Okay, not a fan of the tough love.
I just can't believe that Mike didn't give me any warning.
But he didn't really know, you know. He wasn't planning on coming to Barbados and proposing to me...
He proposed to you? This is the worst birthday ever.
Look, Precious... Mike's not worth this. You're an attractive, intelligent woman and let's face it, Mike's kind of a wang. I mean, he proposed to me while he was still seeing you... He was gonna break-up with you on your birthday? And, I don't like to kiss-and-tell, but he cheated on you a lot this weekend.
Oh, my God, maybe you're right. Maybe I don't need him. I deserve to be treated with respect.
Screw you, Mike. You're a coward and a bastard, and I hope you rot in hell.
You're welcome!
Honey, you've been in there for a long time... Is everything okay?
Not really.
I have a problem.
Really? What happened?
Well, I was dancing around, and singing "No Woman, No Cry" and I got stuck.
You can't move at all?
Oh, well, I can move...
If I untangle you, will you please get rid of the corn rose?
I guess so...
Some of these look a little frayed.
Yeah, I tried to gnaw myself free.
Hey!
Hi!
So, did you err... did you tell Ross?
Well, I tried, but then he had a shampoo related emergency. So I guess now it's your turn again.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no... I think it's better if you tell him, you know. It's easier for a woman. That way, you know, if he gets mad, all you have to do is go... I didn't mean it. I'm so so--ooory.
Yeah, 'cause that's what we do.
Alright, alright, okay, uhm... How 'bout this, how about this? Tomorrow... tomorrow we'll both go and we'll tell him together.
Okay, that sounds fair. It just means that once again we can't...
I know, I know..., but that's okay. I mean, we can control ourselves, we're not animals.
No! Of course we can wait. Alright, so I guess that means good night then?
Yeah! Good night!
Goo--ood night!
Good night!
Seriously, good night!
Stop saying good night.
Okay.
Look what I found in the drawer... And you said I'd never wear this...
Now that I untangled you, how 'bout you doing a little something for me?
Sure, what do you have in mind?
I think you know.
Really? I don't really feel like it.
This is what I want to do.
Okay, I just don't get why you like it so much.
She's an FBI agent, posing as a beauty contestant.
Okay, Ross, I realise that you didn't expect to walk in and see that, but.. Let me explain, okay?
We weren't doing anything!
Rach, he just saw us.
Shhh.
But what you saw, that is the extent of it, okay? One kiss.
No, come on, that is a lie. We also kissed in Barbados.
Dude, chill! Okay, we also kissed in Barbados, but we didn't plan it, okay? And the only reason that that happened was because I saw you kissing Charlie.
Yeah, you started it! I've got to chill.
Look, we probably should have talked to you about this before it ever happened, but..
We feel so terrible about this, Ross.
Yeah, but it did happen, so...
Ross?
Ross? Can we just close the door?
Ross, say something. Anything.
So you two are..?
Yeah.
And have you .. ed?
No, no, no!
No, no, no!
But if I hadn't walked in here, would you..?
Probably.
No, no!
Ross, this is not how we wanted you to find out about this. You have every right to go nuts.
I'm not going nuts. Do you see me go nuts?
No, but you know what I mean.
Hey, hey, hey... If you two are happy, then I'm happy for you. I'm fine!
Really?
Absolutely. I'm fine! Totally fine. I don't know why it's coming out all loud and squeaky, 'cause really, I'm fine. I'm not saying I wasn't a little surprised to see you guys kissing. I mean, at first I was like.. But now that I've had time to absorb it; Lovin' this.
Ross..
It's all working out! Me & Charlie, and you two. You know what we should do?
Calm ourselves?
No. We should all have dinner. Yes, we'll do it tomorrow night. I'll cook!!
Look, don't you think that will be a little weird?
Weird? What? What's weird? The only thing weird would be if someone didn't like Mexican food, because I'm making fajitas!!
I do like fajitas.
God, this adoption stuff is so overwhelming. There's inter-country adoption, dependency adoption.. There are so many ways to go, and this is like the biggest decision of our lives.
There's a hair in my coffee.
Hey guys!
Hey.
Hey, have you seen Frank Jr., 'cause he's meeting me here with the triplets.
You know, it's funny. Every time you say "triplets," I immediately think of three hot blonde 19-year olds.
That's sweet. Drink your hair.
Hey, what's all this stuff?
Oh, they're brochures from different adoption agencies.
Ooh, babies! Oh, this one is so cute, get this one!
That's not really how it works.
Oh, how does it work?
I don't know!
Well, if you're having a hard time, you should talk to my friends, Bill and Colleen. They adopted a kid. I'm sure they'd help you.
Thanks, that would be great. Hey, honey, wouldn't that be great?
Alright, alright, alright. Remember what we talked about. When we're in a public place, there are certain rules.
That's not what we talked about!!
Hey!
Hey.
Good to see you.
Good to see you, too.
Hi Frank.
Hi, how you doin'?
Oh, my goodness, they've all gotten so big!
Which one is which again?
Oh, that's Frank Jr. Jr. pulling the tampons out of the lady's purse. And that's Chandler climbing on Chandler, and that's Leslie throwing bagels at him.
"Willing to adopt triplets?" No!
Ah, can I just say I know we're doing this for Ross, and that's cool, but if it was up to me, this is not what we'd be doing on our first date.
Well, what would we be doing?
I'd take you out for a romantic night. Some champagne, fancy dinner, feel you up on the carriage ride home...
Feel me up?
In a carriage!
Hey, Charlie!
Hey.
Hi, hi. So.. Dreading this?
Oh, you bet.
So, did you bring a little something for Ross?
Actually.. It's stuff you left at my apartment.
Oh. Oh, thanks.
And you know, you can just give me my stuff whenever you want.
Yeah, I didn't throw any of that out..
I thought I heard voices! Hi Charlie! Hi Joey. And.. Oh! You're gonna have to introduce me to your new girlfriend. I'm just kidding, I know Rachel, I know. Come, please come in. Come in.
Okay, well, we brought you some wine.
Oh! That is so thoughtful. She's a keeper. And what did you bring me?
Uh, actually, that's..
Underwear, a toothbrush, and Van Halen CD. I can use all these things!!
Gosh, Ross, you know, you seem a little...
What? Fine? Because I am! Aren't you? Aren't you? Aren't you? You see? Who else is fine?
Okay, listen, hey, Ross. Why don't you try to relax, okay? Maybe have a drink.
You know what? That is a very good idea. I'm gonna go make a pitcher of Margaritas.
Oh, god. So adorable. Look at them sleeping there like angels.
Yeah, I really cherish these moments, 'cause before you know it, they're gonna be awake again.
Well, they may be a handful, but they're so cute.
Yeah.
Oh, god, the last time I babysat them, they did the funniest thing..
I haven't slept in four years!
That's a, that's a long time.
You just don't know how hard it is, Phoebe. There's just so many of them. You know, two I can handle. Two's great. You just hold one in each hand, but what do I do when the third one runs at me with his bike helmet on. I've got no more hands to protect my area! There's three of them, Phoebe, three!
Yeah, I know, Frank. I counted them when they were coming out of my area.
Sometimes I think that.. Oh, no, no, no, I can't say it, it's too horrible. No.
What?
No, I can't.
Oh my god, Frank, are you thinking of leaving? Because I didn't have those triplets so you could just run out on them!
Oh, no! I would never do that. No. I just was thinking that, you know, maybe you could take one.
What?! You can't separate them! That's terrible. Which one?
Thank you so much for seeing us. Phoebe has told us such great things about you guys.
Oh, please, we're happy to help.
We went through the same thing when we were adopting.
So, a lot of malfunctioning wee-wees and hoo-hoos in this room, huh?
I mean, you have a lovely home.
Well, we appreciate anything you can tell us.
Well, actually, I think this might help.
It's pretty much all the information you need.
Oh my god!
Everything is broken down into categories, and then cross-referenced, and then colour-coded to correspond with the forms in the back.
Thank you. I think I just had a tiny orgasm.
I know the process is frustrating, but it's so worth it. Adopting Owen was the best thing that ever happened to us.
That's great. Can I see the book?
You want me to wash my hands first, don't you?
It's.. It's just so pretty and white.
The bathroom is down the hall, to your left.
I would have told him to do it too.
Can I adopt you?
Hey, you must be Owen.
Yeah.
I'm Chandler. Hey, I was in the scouts too.
You were?
Yeah, in fact my father was a den-mother.
Huh?
You know how to use a compass?
I have a badge in it.
You do? That's fantastic!
You wanna see it?
I'd love to, but I gotta get back to talking to your parents. They're telling us all about how they adopted you.
What?!?
What?
I'm adopted?
I got nothing.
The first batch of margaritas was not so great, but the second batch is gooooood.
Well, maybe the next batch, we could all get some.
Oh, guys, this is fun, isn't it? You know? Just the four of us. Just hangin'.
Dude, are you okay? And when are the fajitas gonna be ready?
I'm fine! Hey, I'm great! I'm just.. I'm just proud of us. There's no weirdness, no tension.
No awareness.
We make a great foursome. We should do more stuff together. Ooh! Let's take a trip. Okay, where do you think we - we can go?
My fajitas!!
Look, Charlie, I just want you to know. Ross is just having a little trouble adjusting to the thought of Joey and me. You know, he normally doesn't drink like this.
Oh, you know what? This is nothing. My father is a raging alcoholic.
Oh, I'm sorry, have I made this evening uncomfortable?
Fajitas! Be careful, very hot plate, very hot plate!!
Ross, you don't even have oven mitts on!
That is gonna hurt tomorrow!
Okay, well, this is crazy. Can't seriously be talking about me taking one of your kids, can we?
No, of course we're not.
Insane.
I know.
Alice would never go for it, right?
Oh, I don't know, she's pretty tired, too, I think we've got her onboard.
Well, just you know, for argument's sake, you know, hypothetically. Which one would you be willing to give up?
Huh.
Frank Jr.Jr.?
Oh, you'd be getting a really good one. I mean, you know, he's really funny. Like, the other day he made up this joke.
Uh-huh.
What's green and says "hey, I'm a frog"? A talking frog! Oh, no, you can't have him, he's too funny.
Well, alright, that's fine. What about Leslie?
Oh, no, no. Not Leslie. No, she's, she's the only one that knows how to burp the alphabet.
Alright, so that leaves Chandler.
Oh, no, no, you can't have Chandler, no. No, no. She's my little genius. I got big hopes for her. She's gonna be a doctor or a realtor..
Wow, Frank. I think we just ran out of kids.
Oh, I think you're right. Oh, wow. Phoebe, I don't think I can give one of them up. I mean, you know, they drive me crazy, but they're my babies.
I'm sorry, Frank. I didn't realise things were so bad. You know, I'll help out more. I can - I can babysit any time you want. You name the day, and I'll be there.
How about tomorrow?
Well, that's not good. But you know, I can move some stuff around, and I'll be there. You and Alice just take the whole day together.
You'd do that for us?
Are you kidding? That's what sisters are for. Frank Jr. : Look at them! Aw. I love you so much. Oh crap, don't wake up, don't wake up!
Where are Bill and Colleen?
They're in the kitchen getting something to eat. Can you believe how nice they are?
We have to leave!!
Why? What did you do in the bathroom?
I didn't get to the bathroom. I bumped into Owen on the way, and he didn't know he was adopted. And there's a slight chance I may have told him.
Oh my god, where's my purse? No, you know what? I can replace everything in there. Get that binder, and let's go!
Hey.
Some little snacks for everybody. Oh, you don't have to eat the sour worms. Those are for Owen.
I'll go get him in a second. By the way, you should know we haven't told him he's adopted yet.
But kids are so intuitive. Don't you think on some level he already knows?
I'm adopted?!
See? Intuitive!
What? Where did you hear that?
He told me! And he paid me 50 dollars not to tell.
Which technically now you should give back!
You told him he's adopted?
I'm so sorry, but you should have a sign out there or something. Or at least whisper it to people when they come in the door. "Owen doesn't know he's adopted, and he also thinks that Santa is real."
He isn't?!
We have to get out of here, baby!
Everyone? I would like to make a toast to Rachel and Joey.
Ooy.
And to love. Ah, love. L-O-V-E, love. L is for life. And what is life without love?
Oh my god, are we supposed to answer?
O is for "oh, wow!" The V is for this very surprising turn of events, which I'm still fine with by the way. E is for how extremely normal I find it. That you two are together. And now one day you might get married and have children of your own.
Dude, are you okay?
Totally.
Ross, you don't seem okay.
I'm sorry, it must be the pressure of entertaining. I think everyone would feel better if we had some flan.
Wait, Ross. Ross. I - I have to take off.
No!
I'm sorry, I have a really early class in the morning, but this has been lovely.
Wasn't it? And you thought it would be awkward with Joey and that you never really liked Rachel.
You're on fire! I'll call you in the morning, okay?
Okay.
Alright.
God, Rachel, what Ross just said that is just so..
Oh, that's okay, girls tend not to like me.
Bye.
Okay, I guess it's just flan for three! Hey, hey, that rhymed!
You know what, Ross? I think we're gonna take off too.
Oh, oh. Of course. God, I'm so stupid. You guys are a couple now. I mean, you probably just want to be alone.
No, no, it's just that it's getting late...
Hey, hey, it's fine. It's totally fine. We've got plenty of margaritas. It's all good.
I don't even know what that's for.
You know what? I think I'm gonna stay here and make sure he's okay.
Yeah, that's probably a good idea.
Yeah. I'll see you in the morning.
Uh-huh. Okay. You know what, Joey, I don't think he's ever gonna be okay with this.
It doesn't look good, does it?
Morning. Here you go.
Thanks. Did you stay here all night?
Yeah.
So you took off my pants and shoes?
No, no, no. You actually did that when you were dancing to the Chicago-soundtrack. Look, Ross, about, about Rachel and I. Listen, you don't have to worry about that, okay? Because nothing is gonna happen.
What do you mean?
Well, she and I said from the beginning that we weren't gonna do anything unless you were okay with it. And clearly..
Hey, what are you talking about? I'm fine!
It's okay, Ross, alright? I totally understand. Of course you're not fine. You're.. You're Ross and Rachel.
Except we're not. I mean, we haven't been a couple in like, six years. Oh my god, is that right? Has it been that long?
That's what I hear, yeah.
This is crazy. I mean, six years? And because of me you guys aren't gonna be together? Can I ask you something? Really, what is this thing with you and Rachel?
Come on, I mean, you know me, you know...
Joey.
I'm crazy about her.
And she feels the same way?
I think so.
Well, then, maybe it's time we all moved on.
Yeah, but, Ross, I mean, you're not okay with it.
No, but I wanna be. Hey, I will be. Besides, I'm with Charlie, right? Oh my god, I'm still with Charlie, aren't I? I mean, she didn't see the dance, did she?
No, no, no, no, that was - that was just for me. Are you sure about this?
Yeah, I'm sure.
And we're okay?
Hey, Phoebs.
Hey.
Uhm, we just wanna give you a heads-up. Bill and Colleen hate us.
Owen didn't know he was adopted, and Monica told him.
What?
Still, he had to find out sometime.
Yeah, but how would you like it if someone told the triplets that you gave birth to them?
I'm gonna go tell Emma she was an accident.
So, you and Rachel tonight, huh?
Yeah. It's actually our first official date.
Wow! So tonight may be the night! You're nervous?
Naa, no. This is the part I'm actually good at.
What must it be like not to be crippled by fear and self-loathing.
It's OK!
How can you be so confident?
Well, I... I know exactly what I'm gonna do!
Really? Like you have a routine?
No, no no no no. See. Each woman is different.You have to appreciate their uniqueness.
Really?
No, I do six things! First, I look deep in her eyes. Then, I kiss her. Next I take my hand and I softly graze her thigh.
You mean like this?
NO! Not like that, no no. No, like this.
Oh, I see what you mean, that's quite nice.
More foosball?
...and beer!!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey sweetie!
WOW!
Hey! Stop staring at my wife's legs! No no! Stop staring at your sister's legs!
I'm sorry, it's just... how did you get so tan?
She went on one of those spray-on tan places.
Eh, you got a spray-on tan?
Chandler gets pedicures!
Why, why you do, like with the-the toe separators?
Why...why?
Still, I can't believe that's sprayed on... I mean, it looks really good. I wonder if I should get one!
Sure, then you should get a mini skirt so you can really show it off.
So, do you get colours or just French tips?
There. Here's their card.
Thanks. Hey, I know where this place is! It used to be an X-rated video... florist.
Hey!
Hey Pheebs!
Hey Phoebe!
Oh, you won't believe who moved back to town.
I know, Amanda! Ah! She called me too! She's the worst!
Who's Amanda?
She's this girl who used to live in the building before you did. Then she moved to England and she picked up this fake British accent. On the machine this is her message. "Monica, darling! It's Amanda calling!"
Are you trying to do a British accent?
Chandler gets pedicures!
Just so I know, how many more of those can I expect?
You know what Amanda said to me when she got me on the phone? "Oh, so sorry to catch you on your Mo-Bile!" If-if you don't wanna get me on my mo-Bile, don't call me on my mo-Bile!"
I know, and she's always bragging about all the famous people she's met.
Oh, I know! "Oh...I slept with Billy Joel". All right, who hasn't?
Oh, what are we gonna do! I don't wanna see her!!
Ugh, Let's just cut her out!
What?
Cut her out of our lives! Just ignore her calls and dodge her 'till she gets the point!
Oh, I guess we could try that, but... it seems so harsh! Have you ever done that?
No, had it done to me though. Feels good !
Alright Mr. Geller! Right this way! So, how dark do you wanna be? We have one, two or three.
Well... I like how you look, what are you?
Puerto Rican.
Two, I think a two.
You've got to face the red light. When the red light goes on the spraying is about to start so close your eyes. When the spraying stops, count to five. Pat yourself down to avoid drip marks then turn around so we can get your back. Got it?
Spray, count, pat, then turn, spray, count and pat.
Wow, you catch on quick.
Well, I have a PhD, so...
One Mississipi, two Mississipi, Three Mis... WAIT! WAIT! I'm not-I've not finished counting!!
You sprayed my front twice!
You've never turned?
No, I barely even got to three Mississippi.
Mississippi? I said count to five'!
Mississippilesly? Well, how bad is it?
Ain't that bad yet, but it keeps getting darker for the next four hours.
So, how dark is it gonna get?
You got sprayed with two two' s and...
I'm a four?
Yeah, but you're back's a zero. You're gonna wanna even that out.
Really!
You might wanna get back in there.
Ok!
Wait, wait a minute, there's no light on the back wall! How do I know when it's gonna start? Hello? Ah, oh, ah! Ah! The same thing happened again!
You got two more twos?
I'm an eight!
Thanks for dinner.
I thought you paid. Ha, guess we won't be going back there!
So.
Yeah.
Hey what do you say, we move this onto the likes of the couch?
I say 'cheesy line', but ok.
What's the matter?
I am sorry, I don't know, I am sorry, I don't know why I did that!
Okay.
Ok, so sorry.
I am sorry! Again... I don't know, I don't know what happened, I must be nervous!
I don't get it, Chandler loved it!
Ok, ok, ok. I promise, I promise, I promise, I won't do it again. I really do. I promise. This is gonna be great.
Ok.
Uh, was that good for you?
No, no, don't get it. Let the machine pick up.
Oh, yeah. Could be Rachel asking if someone could baby-sit again.
It could be Amanda!
Oh, you're right! I was just kidding about Rachel. Babysitting is a gas!
Hello Monica. It's Amanda calling again. I am in the neighborhood hoping I can pop by your flat!
You're from Yonkers! Your last name is Buffo-Martisis!
Let's see.. to assure you get this directly, ring me back on my mobile.
Ok, don't hold thy breath!
Hello? Is someone on the line?
Yes, I was looking for Monica.
Hang on, she's right here. Someone's on the phone, for ya.
We weren't picking up, it's Amanda!
I get pedicures!
Hi Amanda! Actually now... it's... is not a good time. Dinner tomorrow night? Ok, Phoebe and I will see you then!
Why, why, why didn't you just say no!
Well, I said 'no' to her coming over now! I couldn't say 'no' twice! I get this uncontrollable need to please people!
Fine, fine! You would not hold up well under torture!
And you would?
I did!
Rach, you sure you wanna do this?
Absolutely! Absolutely. I d... it's just a little weird, it's you, and it's me, it's just gonna take some getting used to.
Ok. Well, how, how can we make it easier?
Ok, let's work from the top down! Just work the bra, Joe!
Ok, yeah, got it.
Okay.
This thing welded shut?!
Okay.
All right, turn around, I got to get a look at this thing.
Oh!
Ow!
Sorry!
Well this is romantic!
I'm sorry! This never happened to me before! I'm an expert at taking off bras! I can do it with one hand! I can do it with my eyes closed! One time I just looked at one, and it popped open! I blame your bra!
It's a standard issue bra clasp!
Then I blame you! Yeah! That's right! You threw me off with all your slapping!
Ok well, well I'm really, I'm sorry about that Joey, but do you think that maybe on some level, you don't want to take off my bra?
NAH! I don't have another level!!
Hold on! There is something different.
I went to that tanning place your wife suggested.
Was that place... The Sun?
Oh! And it gets worse!
Oh My God! You can do a duet of Ebony and Ivory all by yourself!
How could you mess this up? It's so easy? You go into the booth, you count to five and you turn around!!
How do you count to five?
One Two Three...
Damnit!
oooh! Oh oh!
I Know!
oh oh! What is up with Miss Hawaiian Tropic?
How was your date with Joey?
Well, it was good.. until we got back to our apartment, and then we were fooling around and he started to put his hand up my leg and I kept slapping it away!
You didn't like that?
Well, it wasn't just me, alright? He freaked out too! He couldn't even undo my bra!
Wow, really? One time he just looked at my bra and it popped open.
I do not know what's wrong with us, I mean, we have kissed before and that's been great! But this time it was leading somewhere and I was very aware of the fact that it was Joey touching me.
Well, you guys have been friends forever. Remember the first time that you kissed Ross? How weird that was? You couldn't stop laughing? You got through that.
Ok, that's true. That's true, we can do this. You're right, you're right, we can do this. We're just gonna power through!
Hey Chandler can I talk to you for a second .
No need!! Problem solved, we are powering through .
Chandler, stop! It is not going to pop open!
You don't know!
Hey Phoebe!
Hey!
Is Amanda here yet?
No.
Oh good. Good, look I'm so sorry, for screwing up that cutting-her-out plan. But I have a new plan. Chandler agreed to call here in a few minutes with an emergency.
Oh! Well, what kind of emergency that gets us both out of here?
Well, what do you think of Mike and Chandler being in a car accident?
Are you kidding, I love it!
Hi!
Hi!
Hi!
Hello!
It's so nice to see you! Both of you! Look at me. Look how young I look! Oh gosh! We have so much to catch up on! But first things first: touch my abs I don't exercise at all! Oh gosh, so Monica, you're married!
Yeah! Yeah! His name is Chandler and...
Smell my neck! It's not perfume! It's me! It's my natural scent!
Musty!
Oh! Gosh! This is brilliant. Gosh, it's just like old times. I'm so happy you two are friends again!
When were we not friends?
Well, it was 1992, and I remember because that was the year I had sex with Evil Knievel .
Ehm, we were friends in 1992.
No I distinctly remember you were dodging her calls and trying to avoid seeing her.
You were going to cut me out?
Well...kinda.
Oh My God!
Oh! Bugger. Should I not have said that? I feel like a perfect arse!
Yeah well, in America you're just an "ass".
Hello? Chandler, what's wrong? Oh my God, are you alright? Yeah, I'll be right there. I'm so sorry, but Chandler was in a car accident.
Oh my God. Was Mike with him?
Nope!
Hey!
Hey! Got champagne?
Yes ma'am, ready to Power through!
Excellent! Stick it in the ice bucket, the phone is off the hook, and in the interest of powering through ...
Uh!
Ok Sexy, sexy, very sexy, sexy. Alright! Lets do it!
Ok, you're scaring me a little bit.
Oh! Get over it soldier, we've gotta do this! Ok. Aha! You like that huh?
Oh! yeah!
You like that? Let's take this into high gear.
uh uh!
Yeah baby, I'll show you how we do it!
No, no, no! You kneed me in my misters!
What? Oh my God! I'm so sorry. Joey? Are you ok?
Soldier down!
We are not friends with Phoebe anymore.
If she asks, I protested a little, but ok!
Oh Chandler! Thank God you're alive. Monica, can I talk to you outside for a minute?
I have nothing to say to you.
Wow, my flat is twice this size!
Please, Monica? In the hall?
Ooh, that accident must have been terrible. You look positively ghastly.
Well, aren't you a treat.
I can't believe you tried to cut me out. Why Phoebe, why?
It was right after we were living together and you were driving me crazy, okay? You were really controlling and compulsive and shrill.
I'm still all those things!
You're also so generous and kind and scrappy!
I am scrappy.
Exactly! Look, no matter what I tried to do, I couldn't keep you out of my life. Of all the people I have cut out, you were the only one who ever clawed her way back in.
It's because I'm scrappy.
Yeah, you are. And I'm so glad that you fought your way back in, because I don't know what I would do without you.
I won't know what I would do without you.
Well, I guess we should go back in. When you gave me another chance, I guess we should do the same for Amanda.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
Can you believe it. I've never had any professional dance training.
Now, let me explain how this works. You go into the booth, and...
I'm gonna stop you right there, Glenda. Okay? Does it look like this is my first time, huh? Now I want 4 two's... and I want them all on my back.
Okay...
Wait a minute, there's two sets of nozzles, which one is it?
Which... which... which... Which one is it?
OH! SON OF A BITCH!
What is the matter with us?
Well, I know what's the matter with me.
No, I mean with us, you know. I mean, is it supposed to be this... difficult?
I don't know.
That fake British woman is a real bitch, but she sure can dance... Hey!
Hi! Hey, listen, can we ask you a question? When you and Monica first hooked up, was it weird going from friends to... more than that?
Kinda... you know, sneaking around, having to hide from you guys...
No, no, no... No, I mean... se-x-u-ally...
Yeah, was there a part of you that... felt like it was... really wrong?
Actually, no. No, it felt right. You know, it felt like uhm... I can't believe we haven't been doing this the whole time.
I can tell from your expressions that that's the good news you were hoping for... Well, I'm gonna go continue to... spread the joy.
Well, just because it happened that way for them doesn't mean it has to happen that way for us.
Yeah, yeah... Absolutely. I mean, just because something's difficult doesn't mean that you quit.
Right, totally.
Yeah, so we just keep trying and trying until we... do it.
Yeah, and if doesn't work, then we'll be just one of those couples that never have sex.
That's a... pla-an.
Wow... I did not see this coming.
I know.
I don't get it. I mean, I was so sure this was what I wanted.
Hmmm... Me too...
I wonder how Monica and Chandler could do it?
I guess they weren't as good friends as we are.
Aah... I bet you're right.
So...
Yeah.
I love ya.
Love you too... Alright, I'm going to bed.
Yeah, me too.
Ooh, yeah, I'm not going anywhere for a while.
Dude, it's Chandler. Let me in.
Go away! I don't want to see anybody.
I know, I went to the tanning place and the same thing happened to me. You have to let me in.
Really? Did you count Mississipily?
Dude, you're not tanned.
No, I just had to get a picture of this.
I see you later! end.
Hey guys!
Hey!
Honey, I got us that room at the Woodford Inn this weekend.
That place in Vermont? You can take a hint!
Wait, you can't go away this weekend! It's Emma's birthday!
Yeah!
We're having a party.
Well, can't you just have the party when we get back?
No.
No, that day... that won't be her real birthday!
Gee if only she were one and had no idea what the hell a birthday was!
C'mon you guys, this is really important to us.
Well, I'm sorry, but Chandler and I could really use a weekend away. You know, to reconnect... emotionally.
There's this thing I really want us to do. I read about it in Maxim...
Well, can't you just go to Vermont the next day?
Yeah, we want everyone to be there. As much as I hate to delay your doing weird sex stuff to my little sister.
And I mean, you know, you guys... This is a big deal. I mean, how can we have her first birthday party without her aunt and her uncle!
All right, we'll stay. We can just drive up after the party.
Fine, but if we end up not doing this Maxim thing because of this party...
Believe me, that is not why we won't be doing that!
You know Pheebs, when I was little, on my birthday, my daddy would hide a present in every room of the house, and then he would draw a treasure map to help me find 'em all.
Oooh, I love family traditions like that. When uhm... when Ursula and I were kids, on our birthday, our stepdad would sell his blood to buy us food!
Hey guys!
Hi!
Hey, I brought the camera for Emma's video.
Oh, good, good! We had this idea to make a birthday video for Emma and we'll give it to her when she is 18.
Oh, COOL!! Wow, it's like a time capsule!
Yeah!
Oh, just think... she's gonna be watching that video on a TV that hasn't even been invented yet! With friends who right now are just like babies! And they'll be living in a floating city that the humans built to escape the ant people!
That's the hope! So, is Emma awake yet?
Oh no, it's still nap time. But she'll be up soon.
Ah, and where is Joey?
I said it's still nap time.
Hey, there is uncle Joey!
Hey!
Hey, say something to Emma on her 18th birthday!
18, uh?
Joey, NO!
What, what!? it's for her hot friends!
When they see this you'll be 52!
And starting to think about settling down!
Hey Joey, will you please set this up for people to put Emma's presents on?
I'd love to! Yeah!
We were supposed to bring presents?
Yeah! I wrote Emma a song.
Oh, yeah! How was I supposed to know?
Joey, it's a birthday party.
Yeah, but for a one-year-old. What's the point... the other day she laughed for like an hour at a cup. Just a cup with a picture of Elmo on it dressed as a farmer. And he's standing next to this cow and the cow says "El-moo"! Yeah... that's a funny cup!
Hey!
Hey hey! Where's the birthday girl?
Oh, she's still napping.
Oh, sure, she was probably up all night, excited about the party she knows is happening.
Look, I know that you guys really want to get to Vermont and this isn't a really big deal to you, but it really is to us, ok? Emma will never have a first birthday again.
All right... you're right. We're sorry. Now let's wake up Emma and get the fun time started!
No really, she didn't sleep well last night, so we can't wake her up.
Are you freaking kidding me, Green?
HI!
Hey!
So glad you came!
I can't believe Emma is already one!
I remember your first birthday! Ross was jealous of all the attention we were giving you. He pulled on his testicles so hard! We had to take him to the emergency room!
There's something you didn't know about your dad!
Hey Mr. and Mrs. Geller! Let me help you with that.
Thank you!
Oh man, this is great, uh? The three of us together again! You know what would be fun? If we gave this present to Emma from all of us!
Which one are you?
I can't believe Emma is still asleep!
I know, what are we gonna do?
I've got a plan. I've got a plan. I'm going to ram this platter really hard into your ribs. You're gonna scream out and that'll wake her up!
I'm not going to Vermont with this Monica!
Hey Pheebs, you know what? I was thinking... since you wrote a song, maybe I could do something for Emma using my talents!
So you're gonna... hit on her?
No, no, no! My talents as an actor!
Oh!
You know, I could like maybe... I could do a dramatic reading of one of her books!
Or you could stick a fork in an apple!
Hey, I think Emma might like it!
Oh! Emma might like what?
Um, my present!
What did you get her?
Actually we prepared performances.
Separate performances.
But equally real!
Well, this sounds like fun! Well, you know what? Actually? People are getting a little antsy waiting Emma to wake up from her nap, so would you mind performing them once now?
Sure, yeah!
O K.
All right, let's get this party started, huh? Joey and Phoebe are gonna perform a little something for us.
Oh, great!
Are you gonna be embarrassed going up there having nothing prepared?
Hey, I do it every week with three cameras pointed at me and a whole crew waiting!
So, Joey, what are you gonna do for us?
I will be doing a dramatic reading of one of Emma's books.
Oh, ok, which one?
Uh, why, it's a... one of her favorites, uh, "Riding the Storm Out. Coping with post-partum depression" eesh! "Love you forever". Love you forever. By Robert Munsch. Published by Firefly books. Printed in Mexico. A mother held her new baby and very slowly rocked him back and forth, back and forth, back and forth, and while she held him she sang "I'll love you forever, I'll like you for always, as long as I'm living, my baby you'll be". . And while he rocked her, he sang "I'll love you forever, I'll like you for always, as long as I'm living, my baby you'll be".
Wow! That was amazing!
Thank you so much for that gift!
I was not ready for this today!
Amazing... amazing.
Oh, Phoebe, I'm sorry! Phoebe has prepared something as well.
That's right, I've prepared a song for Emma. From my heart to hers. For there's no greater gift, than the gift of music. Emma! Your name poses a dilemma. 'Cause not much else rhymes with Emma! Maybe the actor Richard Crenna, he played the commanding officer in Rambo. Happy birthday Emma!
Is that it?
No, of course not! I also, you know, prepared a reading . "Sex and the single mother. Finding your G-spot.
No, no, no, no, no!
Hello Emma. Happy eighteenth birthday.
Right now that seems so far away, seventeen years.
Yes, you'll be all grown up by then. We'll be... Well your grandfather and I might not be here.
That's true! This message could becoming to you from beyond the grave, Emma!
After all, my parents died very young.
And my cholesterol's off the charts!
Remember, Emma, heart disease kills women too!
Ok, cut! Great. That was... that was just... yeah!
Ross, um, don't forget to get a shot of Emma's cake. It's in a box in the fridge.
Sure.
Oh, you're gonna love this cake. I got it from a bakery in New Jersey, Corino's.
Oh my God, that place has the creamiest frosting! I use to hitchhike there when I was a kid.
Well, anyway, they make these great novelty cakes, in all different shapes, and if you give them a photo, they'll copy it in icing!
Oh, did you do a picture of Emma?
Yes! On a cake shaped like a bunny.
Uh, Rach? Does this bakery by any chance also bake erotic cakes? Say for bachelorette parties?
Ross, what are you talking about? oh! Oh my God! They put my baby's face on a penis!
oh! Now it's a party!
Why you guys this isn't funny, all right? If I wanted this cake to be a disaster I would have baked it myself!
Uh.. is it ok that I still think it looks delicious?
Jack, look at this.
I know what you're thinking Judy, the resemblance is uncanny!
I am this close to tugging on my testicles again.
No, no, this is not what I ordered. Ok? I went all the way to New Jersey so that I could have the perfect cake for my daughter's birthday and I need a bunny cake, right now!
Ask them if it would be faster if we cut the baby's face off the penis, so we can put it on the bunny. . That is a weird sentence!
Oh! Believe you me! I am going to bring this cake back, I don't even want it in my home... Joey, don't touch it!!
I'm so confused!
Yes, yes. I still want my daughters picture, but on a bunny cake. Yellow cake, chocolate frosting with nuts!
To be fair this one does have nuts.
Hey Mon, that was really nice of you to loan Rachel your car so she could go and get the cake.
Oh. So nice of her to pull my hair, 'till I dropped the key!
Well, you know what? While we're waiting, you guys could tape your message to Emma for her 18th birthday, huh? Ok!
Hi Emma! It's the year 2020. Are you still enjoying your nap?
We're Aunt Monica and uncle Chandler, by the way. You may not recognize us, because we haven't spoken to your parents in seventeen years!
We used to be married, but then we missed a weekend away together and things kind of unraveled. Because of you! Happy Birthday.
Ross, Rachel promised it would be over by now. We seriously have to go, if we want to get to Vermont. I called them and the last train leaves in a half hour.
And you know, I have a massage client soon.
You guys, just please.. a little bit longer. I promise, Rachel will be back with the cake any minute. Monica, remember.. the frosting? huh?
Alright, 5 more minutes.
Hello? Oh no! What happened? Ok ok, where are you? . Ok, I'll be right there.
Was that Emma? Is she up?
No, Rachel got pulled over for speeding. She forgot her licence so now I have to bring it to her.
Well, if you're leaving, I'm definitely gonna go.
No! Wait! If anybody gets to go.. it's us We've been complaining the longest!
No, wait ! You guys, no, no, you can't leave! Rachel already feels bad that the cake's messed up. How do you think she's gonna feel when she comes back here and all you guys are gone?
I don't know! You'll tell us on Monday!
Joey! You're in charge, ok? You make sure nobody leaves!
Got it! Hey hey hey! Where do you think you're going?
To the bathroom!
Alright, well the rest of you get comfortable, ok, because we're gonna be here for a li... Wait a minute, there is a window in there!
Oh no! He's not getting away that easy!
What are you doing? Get the hell out of here!
Well, that one did not have Emma's face on it.
No, it did not.
No.
Well, we better get going, it's late. Jack's not allowed to drive at night anymore. He has trouble staying in his lane.
Last winter I went up on a church lawn and drove right through a manger scene. The papers thought it was a hate crime.
Anyway, it was lovely seeing you.
Ok!
Bye... Bye dear.
Nighty-night!
Nighty-night!
Bye, bye.
Joey? How could you just let them leave?
Hey, hey, hey, hey! I'm not gonna mess with Jack, he's a great man, he fought for our country.
No, he didn't! He pretended to be a Quaker to get out of Korea.
Oh! Well that's it! He's the last one to go. I'm locking you guys in.
You do know, I can just turn them the other way around, right?
Oh! I forgot you used to live here!
Hello?
Joey! It's Estelle!
Hey!
So, how did your audition go today?
What audition?
The one I told you about last week?
What? You never said anything about an audition!
Let me start over. I just got a call about an audition. I think you can still make it. It's down at the Astor Theatre and you need to have a monologue prepared.
A monologue? I don't have.. I got it. Aah! so... I'm gonna take off!
Wh.. what? No wait, you don't get to leave! I've got a massage client waiting outside my door any minute!
Yeah, and we've paid for a room, that we're supposed to be in right now!
Well, oh, ok now... Only one of us has to stay with Emma. Ok, and as the person who realized that, I get to go!
No! no! Let's figure out a fair way to decide who's staying.
Oh! I got it! Ok, everyone pick a number from one to ten. Alright? Whoever gets the highest number gets to go first.
Ok, ten.
Okay, Monica picks ten, I call nine! Anyone else?
No, lets just draw straws.
Or.. we could flip a coin, and then multiply the..
I'm begging you stop.
Right.
Ok, how about this: We got wind up toys for Emma for her birthday. We can make them race, and whoever comes in last, stays!
Yeah!! Let's do that!
That sounds more fun than the thing we were going to do in Vermont!
Everybody get your toys!
Ok! I want the dolphin!
Thats a bear.
I'm too excited!
Phoebe, you get the bear, uhm, Joey, you get the robot, and Chandler and I get the dog. Ok, and the race is going to go from here to here. Now the one who comes in last, stays!
Ok, ladies and gentlemen, wind your toys!
Ok, on your mark... Get set... GO!!!
Go! Go!
Come on robot!
What are you barking at?
Wha... How the hell is that gonna help?
I bought you. How did I forget that that's all you do?
Way to go robot!
Good job Alan!
Hey, good race you guys.
Yeah, see you later!
No! No, no... wait! We didn't lose. The rules clearly stated that the last one to cross the finish line was the loser. Well, our dog never crossed the finish line, so technically...
They left.
No, there isn't time to go to the bakery. We're just gonna come home... Everybody left? Alright, well just tell Emma we're gonna be there as soon as we can. Bye...
RACHEL!
OOH! God! Sorry!
I can't believe they gave you a ticket. You're such a good driver.
Emma's awake.
Yeah?
I can't believe this. This is her first birthday. She's awake. We're not even there. Everybody left. We still have this stupid obscene cake.
Hey, maybe I can fix that, you know. Try to turn it into something else.
Oh, why do you even bother? I already ruined her first birthday... And do you know how important these early experiences are Ross? Very! According to the back cover of that book that you gave me.
Rach, she's not going to remember this.
I guess... Oh, I just had such an idea of what this day would be like, you know? Emma laughing and everybody gathered around her cake singing "Happy Birthday". Then we would all go into... HEY GET OUT OF THE ROAD YOU STUPID STUDENT DRIVER!!! They have to learn!
Hey!
What?
It's not bad.
Oh my God! Look what... you made it into a bunny. How did you do that?
Well, I just made these two things uhm... cheeks. And then I split this to make ears.
Well, I'm very impressed.
Some can sing, some can dance. I apparently can turn phallic cakes into woodland creatures.
Now another way to organise your stuffed animals, is by size.
I'm sorry, is this a game for Emma or for Monica?
Game?
Emma, you even know it's your birthday today? You're one! One-year-old, that's little.
Ooh! That's my girl!
That's how old you are.
Did I teach her that? Did I just... impart wisdom?
Ooh, I want one...
Me too...
There's no-one around. Why don't we just take this one?
...and head to Canada!
I was kidding.
I wasn't. Let's get going!
Hey, are Ross and Rachel back?
No, not yet.
Oh good, I didn't miss the party.
What about your massage client?
I just felt so bad, missing this. So I just slipped him a little something, you know. As long as I'm back in five or six hours, it will be alright.
Okay, if Ross and Rachel ask, I've been here the whole time. THE WHOLE TIME!
I've been here the whole time!
Joey, we just saw you come in. You ran past us on the stairs.
I don't care that you left. I'm just glad that you're here. Thanks you guys!
Hey, guys! Come on! You gotta see what Emma just did.
What?
Emma, how old are you? How old are you today?
Wo-ish.
Oh! Emma, that's right! You're that many!
Oh my God! Our daughter's a genius! Rach, this means...
NO, no science camp!
Damnit! I'll put a candle on the cake.
Oh!... Oh and Emma, look at your stuffed animals lined up so neatly!
Thanks!
Okay, here we go! Emma's first birthday cake... Well hey... well, blow out the candle. Come on Emma.
Let's do it, come on!
What's wrong? Are you okay?
Oh yeah, nothing! These are happy tears! This is just what I wanted.
Hey, you made it into a bunny.
What is wrong with me. It looked more delicious when it was a penis.
Okay.
Okay, you ready?
Yeah.
A-a-and... record.
Okay. Hi Emma. Well, your first birthday is over, and it was really...
Go, go, go Alan! Run you, hairy bastard! end.
You know, I'm thinking about letting Emma have her first cookie.
Her first cookie? She has cookies all the time!
I've never given her a cookie. Have you?
No! No... and, for the record, I've also never given her a frosting from a can!
Hey Rach, the adoption agency needs letters of recommendation and we were wondering if you would write one for us.
Of course, I'd be honored!
Thanks!
Thank you!
U-U-Um, I think there's been an oversight.
Joey, we would've asked you, we just thought you wouldn't be interested.
Yeah, it's just we don't think of you as really being so much "with the words".
Whoo-weh hey weh-hey whoo hey!!
Clearly we were wrong.
I gotta a lot of nice stuff to say about you guys, ok? And I know how much you wanna have a baby, you know, and I would love to help you get one.
You know what? Then, Joey, we want you to do it.
Thank you! Alright, let me see how I'm gonna start... "Dear baby adoption decider people..."
So excited about your letter!
Hey!
Hey Phoebe!
Hey!
Wow! Don't you look nice?!
Yes, I do! Today is Mike and my one-year anniversary.
OH! What's it the anniversary of? Your first date, your first kiss, first time you had sex...
YEAH!
So you must be going to somewhere fancy to celebrate?
Uh-uh. Ehm, a Knicks game.
Uhm... Aren't you a little overdressed?
Hey, you know what, I've never had a one-year anniversary before, so no matter where we go, I'm wearing something fancy pants, and... I'm gonna put on my finest jewelry and we're gonna have sex in a public rest room.
You guys do that? Chandler won't even have sex in our bathroom!
That's where people make number two!!
Hey!
Hey...
So, you know... I have a little time. If you... if you want to...
Oh... Ohh... I'd love to but I really have to grade these papers.
Fine, it's fine... I'll just shower by myself...
B, B, B, B, B!
Oh, Ross, you gave a B to a Pottery Barn catalogue.
Well, it had some good ideas, take off your shirt.
Damnit!
Rachel!! Open up!! It's your sister!! I have to talk to you!!
Hi Amy!
You're not Rachel.
Still sharp as a tack!
Um... Charlie, this is Rachel's sister Amy. Amy, this is Charlie.
Hi!
Hi!
Nice to meet you.
H-Hi!! And you are...?
Ross? I... I grew up on your block! We had Thanksgiving together last year... I had a baby with your sister!
N-no... uhm... did I buy a falafel from you yesterday?
Yes, yes, you did.
Hi Rachel! Here's your sister Amy! She thinks I need pec implants!
Amy! Hi! Oh-oh-hoh! Wow! You remember Joey?
Yeah! Hey, sure! The "Days of Our Lives" guy!
That's right, yeah.
You're not good!
Always nice to meet a fan!
So now, what are you doing here?
Well, I have huge news.
Oh sorry, hold on. Let me just check on the baby!
Wait, this is important! Can Ella wait?
Ehm... Her name is Emma.
Why did you change it, Ella was so much prettier!
What do I know? I just sell Middle Eastern food from a cart!
Hey, your English is getting better!!
Oh my God!
I know, she may be the hottest girl I've ever hated.
What... what you working on?
Oh, Monica and Chandler's recommendation. I want it to sound smart but.. I don't know any big words or anything, so...
Why don't you use your Thesaurus?
What did I just say?
Watch. Here, you ehm... You highlight the word you want to change. Go under Tools and the Thesaurus generates... 'gives'... 'gives' a whole list of choices. You can pick the word that sounds smartest.
Oh my God, that's great! I'm smart!! No, no, I'm... "brainy, bright, clever", I love this thing! Look out ladies, Joey Tribbiani's got the whole package!!
God!
So beautiful.
Oh, I know, isn't she?
No, I was talking about your bedding.
All right. What's your news, Amy?
Oh! Um... Well... I'm getting married.
What? Oh my God! To who?
This guy! He has a killer apartment.
A-And??
A-And it's on Fifth. And the elevator opens up right into the living room.
No, what's he like?
Oh! He's ok. Do you remember my old boyfriend Mark?
Yeah.
It's his dad.
Huh... wow, so he's gotta be...
Old? Yeah! But he travels a lot, so he's hardly ever there.
Sweety, I gotta tell ya... it sounds a little bit like you like the apartment more than you like...
Myron. Hmm... I told you he was old!
Oh... sit down, sit down. Oh, honey, you know, I once also almost married somebody that I didn't love. Do you remember Barry?
Humpf, remember him? How we used to make out all the time after you went to sleep.
Sometimes just nodding is ok. Uhm, so but anyway, listen, not marrying Barry was the best decision that I ever, ever made. Honey, you deserve true love. Your soulmate is out there, somewhere. Someone that is your age, that is smart, that is fun and that you care about!
You're right, you're right! I'm gonna do it!
Ok.
I'm gonna marry Myron and keep looking for Mr Right.
Ok, let's keep talking.
Excuse me, anniversary. Excuse me, anniversary. . Uhm, sir, could you move your nachos... they're in my seat. It's my anniversary. Here we are! . Can't believe it's been a whole year!
I know. This has been the best year... THIS HAS BEEN THE BEST YEAR OF MY LIFE!
ME TOO! I NEVER THOUGHT I COULD LOVE SOMEONE THIS MUCH!
I FEEL THE SAME WAY!
YOU'RE SO GENEROUS AND KIND AND YOU'RE AMAZING IN BED IT'S OUR ANNIVERSARY!
Knicks fans, please turn your attention to the big screen on the score board. Someone has a special question to ask.
Oh how lame... oh, it's so tacky, and impersonal.
Really?
Oh, it's the worst way to propose!
Excuse me... .
Hey, finished my recommendation. Here. And I think you'll be very, very happy. It's the longest I ever spent on a computer without looking at porn.
I don't... uh... understand.
Some of the words are a little too sophisticated for ya?
It doesn't make any sense.
Of course it does! It's smart! I used the the-saurus!
On every word?
Yep!
Alright, what was this sentence originally?
Oh, 'They are warm, nice, people with big hearts'.
And that became 'they are humid prepossessing Homo Sapiens with full sized aortic pumps...?
Yeah, yeah and hey, I really mean it, dude.
Hey Joey, I don't think we can use this.
Why not?
Well, because you signed it baby kangaroo Tribbiani . Hey, why don't you stop worrying about sounding smart and just be yourself!
You know what? You don't need a thesaurus, just write from here, your full sized aortic pump.
Amy, hi!
I took your advice, I left Myron.
Oh, good for you!
I know! I'm Erin Brockovich!
Yes you are! Oh, I am so proud of you!
Thank you! So, can I stay with you?
But Erin Brockovich had her own house.
Ah, look who's back! Why do you have bags? RACH, WHY DOES SHE HAVE BAGS?
Well, I'm staying with you guys!
What?
We're gonna be roomies! Come on!
You slept out here?
Yeah... Amy kept kicking me in her sleep yelling 'Myron, get off!'
But uhm, we're getting rid of her, right? Rach, please tell me we're getting rid of her.
Joey, I can't do that!
Oh, come on! Last night I was finishing off a pizza and she said "Uoh oh oh, a moment on the lips, forever on the hips!" I don't need that kind of talk in my house!
Well Joey, uhm look, I know that she's difficult, but I think it's really good that she's here.
'Cause we will appreciate it more when she's gone?
No, it's just... look, you know, when I first moved to the city I was a lot like her! I was spoiled, self-centered and you guys really took care of me.
Yeah, Monica made us!
Well, uhm... whatever, I have really appreciated it, 'cause I don't think I would be the person that I am today if it wasn't for you guys. See, I wanna help Amy the way you guys helped me. And I know it's gonna take patience, but that's ok.
Good morning.
Yeaah.
Amy, that's what I was supposed to wear today, that's why I hung it on the door.
Oh, sweety, you can't pull this off.
Amy, you know what? I was thinking that maybe now it'd be a good time for us to sit down and, you know, talk about your future.
Oh, I can't, honey. I'm gonna go get my eyebrows shaped. I am not happy. Oh... sure you wanna eat that?
I'M CURVY, AND I LIKE IT!
Hi. I just had the worst anniversary ever.
I doubt that! Tell her about us last year.
Oh, well, I bought Chandler a five hundred dollar watch and he wrote me a rap song.
Seriously?
Word!
Well, mine was worse than that.
Well, what happened?
We were at the game, and this guy proposed to his girlfriend on the big screen thing...
Oh, that is so tacky.
Well, that's what I said, but it turns out, Mike was planning on proposing to me that same way last night!
Oh my God, Mike was gonna propose?
Phoebe, that's huge!
Well, do you wanna marry him?
Yeah, I really do! Yes, but, after I dumped on the way he was gonna propose to me, I don't think he's ever gonna ask again! I mean, I said no in Barbados and now this!
She's right! If I were a guy and... Did I just say if I were a guy..?
Maybe you don't need him to propose to you, maybe you can propose to him!
Oh, I don't know, I don't know, isn't that a little desperate?
I proposed to Chandler! Alright, moving on...
Oh, I don't think it was desperate, I think it was amazing!
Thank you.
Well, do you think I should propose?
I think it could be kind of great!
Absolutely! You'll love the feeling! There's nothing like it!
Ok, ok, so how should I do it?
How about at a game, on the big screen?
Uuuh!! How about at a Footlocker?
What? what? He obviously thinks that's a nice way to be proposed to, plus he'd never suspect it!
Yeah, that does make sense. Ok, now, would... would you two like that?
Sounds good to me... but what would a guy think?
Nana is on the phone.
Oh! That's interesting, since she died seven years ago!!
She did? Who got her condo in Boca?
Hello? Oh, it's our nanny! Hi! Oh... God! I hope you feel better! Ok, bye! That's Molly, she's sick. Can you watch Emma today?
No, I can't. I have back-to-back classes. Did Molly say what she had? Because my throat's been hurting?
Menstrual cramps.
I don't think that's what this is.
Can any of you watch Emma?
No, sorry sweety..
No, I've got work and then I'm proposing..
Great, shoot, what are we gonna do?
Well, I can do it.
Well, actually...
Well, can I talk to you for a sec.?
Yeah.
Um, I do not want her baby-sitting our child.
Why not?
Well, for one thing, she keeps calling her Ella!
Wha.. well, Ella's a nice name!
Fine, we'll call the next one Ella.
Wha... the next one?
Okay, um... I don't want her watching our baby.
Ross, I am trying to help her become a better person. This is a huge breakthrough for her! She just offered to do something for another human being!!
I... I don't know..
Ross, I'm telling you, she's giving up getting her eyebrows shaped to do this alright? Do you understand how important that is in our world?
um... listen, I couldn't help but overhear... 'cause I was trying to... Listen, let me do this alright? I really wanna help you guys out, and plus Rachel's been so wonderful to me...
Absolutely.
Oh! Great! So how much does it pay?
Hey Joe! How's the second draft of the letter coming?
Great, I'm finished! In fact, I just dropped it off at the agency.
You dropped it off?
Yeah.
Can we read it? Can you print out another copy?
No can do amigo. No, I didn't use the computer. Felt more personal to hand-write it.
You hand-wrote it?
Yeah, and don't worry. I didn't try to sound smart at all! See ya later!
Oh my God, oh my God, that letter is gonna go in our file! We're never gonna get a kid. No, we're gonna be one of those old couples that collects orchids or has a lot of birds!
It's ok, it's ok. You know what? I'll just call the agency and tell them to throw out the letter.
Okay good.
Hello, this is Chandler Bing. Somebody just dropped off a handwritten recommendation letter, and.. Uh-huh... Uh-huh... okay... thank you. Good-bye. .
Ugh, we're screwed, aren't we? You know what? Just tell me on the way to the bird store.
They loved it.
What?
They thought it was very smart of us to have a child write the recommendation letter.
They thought Joey was a child?
She guessed 8, 9, based on his drawings.
Hi!
Hey, what did you guys do today?
Ella wanted to go out, so we went shopping and got some sushi.
That sounds like fun.
Yeah, not really. Babies are dull.
Hey! Hi, how's my girl?
I'm fine! And, I got you a present for letting me stay with you. Ready?
Yeah!
Ta-daaa!
You pierced her ears!?
Doesn't it make her nose look smaller?
You pierced her ears? How could you do this without telling me?
Well, if I had told you, then it wouldn't have been surprise, now would it?
I think she looks cute. ... but I am wrong!
Oh my God, Oh my God, here comes Ross. He's gonna flip out.
Why, did something happen to his falafel cart?
Ugh.
Hey guys.
Hi Ross.
Hey Emma. Oh, why is she wearing her hat so low? She can barely see. .
Nah, I don't really want her to see.
Why not?
Because there are so many terrible sights in this world.
Like war. Or that thing in Joey's refrigerator. Remember? It was in a milk carton but it looked like meat?
Come here Oh! There she is! Hi!
What?
Nothing.
Hi! What... . Please tell me those are clip-ons.
Oh, they're real!
Did she do this to her? I told you we shouldn't have left Emma with her!
I know, I know, and you were right Ross. You are soo irresponsible I am never letting you baby-sit ever again!
Hey you know what, this kid needs me, okay? She needs to have a cool fun aunt!
I'm a cool, fun aunt!
O-Okay!
Hey! Monica can be cool and fun at organized indoor projects!
I can't believe this. All I wanted to do was help you try to figure out what to do with your life and this is how you repay me?
Well, I don't need you to help me, because I already know what I'm going to do with my life.
Oh yeah? Since when?
Since today... I am going to be a baby stylist.
What?
That's not a thing!
Well, it should be. I'm gonna help babies learn how to accessorize, what colors to wear, what clothes are slimming...
Babies don't care if they're slim.
Enter Amy!
Amy, I ju... I just... I just wanna...
What? What are you gonna do?
No more falafel for you!
Great game, huh?
Uhuh, uhuh...
Why do you keep looking at the screen?
I'm not. I'm praying. Please let the Knicks win... Thank you Thor! Where... where are you going?
Going go to the bathroom.
Well, I think you should wait.
Why?
Well, if you don't... if you don't hold it in, you don't get all the nutrients.
Knicks fans, please turn your attention to the big screen on the scoreboard. Someone has a special question to ask.
Mike Hannigan... will you marry me?
Get a load of this... She's proposing to him. Guess we know who wears the pants in that family.
That's not very enlightened!
Hey, hey! Boo us? Boo you!
Hello? Yeah, this is Joey Tribbiani... Oh, hi! Well, I'm glad you liked my letter... No my mommy and daddy aren't home right now... Okay, bye bye. She was nice!
Joey, get Amy's bags, she is moving out!
Whoo-hoo!
You're kicking me out?
You put holes in my baby's ears!
Yeah well, at least now people will know she is a girl!
I can't believe I ever even tried to help you. You are so beyond help.
You know what? Ever since I got here, you have been nothing but negative.
Excuse me?
You didn't want me to marry the old guy with the great apartment. Then, I tried to help your daughter to de-emphasize her flaws And suddenly I am the bad guy?
Joey, where are those bags?
She has a lot of crap!
You know what? When I moved in here I thought: This is gonna be so great. Just us sisters, back together again like when we were kids, except without that stupid Jill... Oh! Who has gotten fat by the way...
Seriously?
hm-mmm... Mom said she gained like fifteen pounds.
Hips or thighs?
Ass and face.
Oh! Oh my God! I thought she was on Atkins.
She was. Carbs found her... See, this is what I wanted. Two sisters, talking about real stuff.
Oh, I can give you that.
You can?
Yeah. I just, I kept trying to make you a better person, but you're... you're already a pretty perfect version of what you are.
Thank you. I've got to admit, Emma does look cute.
Did you just say Emma?
Ugh, I'm sorry... Ella.
That woman at the game didn't know what she was talking about. Mike, obviously you have balls.
But please, let's just forget the whole thing.
I would love it. Consider it forgotten... But just so you know... however and whenever you decide to propose, I promise I'll say yes. Whether... whether, you know, it is in a basketball game, or in sky writing, or you know, like some lame guy in a cheesy movie who hides it in the cake.
It's in the cake, isn't it?
Where else would lame Mr. No Balls hide it?
What's the matter with me? How do I keep ruining this? I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
No! It's my fault. I keep trying to propose in these stupid ways and all I wanna do is tell you that I love you and I want to spend the rest of my life with you.
I'm gonna do this now.
Oh my God!
Phoebe, I...
Wait! Oh wait! Oh no!
Ready?
Uh-huh!
Phoebe, I love you. There's no-one else in the world I would ask to marry me... three times. But I wanna take care of you, have babies with you, and grow old with you... Phoebe Buffay, will you marry me?
Yes!
I love you!
I love you more!
Not possible! She's gonna be Mrs. No Balls.
So how is the uhm... baby styling business going?
Not that great. It's almost if people don't want to hear that their babies are ugly.
That's shocking!
Oh! It's Ross... Hey Ross! Hello-oo Ross! He's rude!
Hey...
Hey!
Hi!
Pheebs, what's wrong?
Oh, I'm just so exhausted from dragging around this... HUGE engagement ring!
OH!
My God!
Hey!
Congratulations! Wow!!
So, did he get on one knee, did he have a speech prepared, or did he cry? Yeah, big surprise, I like proposals!
Well, it was really sweet, and like the most romantic thing ever.
Well, hey! Well... Here's to Phoebe, who's found the greatest guy in the world! To Phoebe and... I wanna say Mike? To Phoebe and Mike!
Whoo!
Thank you! Oh, and I have something for you!
Mmh-mmh!
It's, yes, my little black book. It's got the numbers of all the guys I've dated.
Oh, Pheebs, baby, that's nice but, you know what, I think I'm ok. Why don't you give it to one of your other single girlfriends?
I would, but you're the last one.
GIVE ME THE BOOK! Pablo Diaz, Brady Smith, huh, "Guy-in-van"?
Oh, my first love!
Oh!
What does the red X next to Bob Greenmore's name mean?
Dead. Oh, it's OK, no, he was old, yeah! And he lived a full life, he was in the first wave at Omaha Beach.
Hey, I'm sorry, I should have given you guys my black book when I got married! Although it wasn't so much a book as a... napkin. With Janice's phone number on it.
Phoebe, isn't Jethro Tull a band?
Oh yes, they are.
Hey honey!
Hi sweetie!
Is Monica not here?
No.
Oh, then I'll tell you. My agency was bidding for a big account and they got it! It's my first national commercial!
Cool!
Yeah, and I don't wanna brag but a lot of the ideas were mine! Hell, you weren't there? All the ideas were mine!!!
That's great! Hey, can you cast me in it?
Oh... I don't know, I really don't think you're right for the part.
What do you mean? I can do anything, I'm a chameleon! Huh? I'm old! I'm tired! Hey, I'm hot I'm cold!! Huh?? Come on! What can't I do?
First of all. Bravo. Uh, but I really don't think you're right for this. The part calls for a stuffy college professor.
I can do that! "Hello, I'm your professor. When I'm not busy thinking of important things or... professing. I like to use..." Oh, what's the product?
Software that facilitates inter-business networking e-solutions?
I'm cold!
Hey!
Hey!
Guess who's a finalist for a huge research grant! I'll give you a hint, he's looking right at you.
Ah, well, unless it's the creepy guy with his hand up his kilt, I'm gonna say congratulations!
Oh, I'm so excited, I mean, apparently I beat out hundreds of other applicants, included five guys I went to graduate school with. Not that I'm keeping score or anything... five!
Wow, that's great! So, tell me about the grant!
Well, ok, it's for 25 thousand dollars. And if I get it, I'll finally be able to complete my field research! And there will be an article about me in the "Paleontology Review"! Yeah! That'll be the first time my name is in there, without people raising serious questions about my work!
Wait. Are you talking about the Dewar grant?
Yeah. Why?
Benjamin Hobart is administering that grant.
Your ex-boyfriend?
Yeah.
So, your ex-boyfriend is gonna determine if your new boyfriend gets this grant? Wow, your new boyfriend is screwed!
No, no, we ended up in great terms. I mean, if anything, I think this could help you. You know what? Why don't we all go out to dinner together, and I can introduce you.
Well, if you think it would help.
Yes, absolutely. I'll call him.
Ok, now, is there anything I can do to... you know, butter him up? Anything he really likes?
Mmh... he does have a pretty serious latex fetish.
We'll see how dinner goes.
Hey!
Hey, you wanna go to see a movie?
Well, I told you I had to spend all the day clearing out stuff, so Mike could move in.
Oh, right.
Yeah.
Oh, well. Now that I'm here I might as well help you with the cleaning and organizing! Just happen to have my label maker!
Oh, it's so hard to get rid of stuff! Did you and Chandler have to make compromises when you first moved in together?
Uh, Chandler did! What does he want you to give up?
A bunch of stuff. And the worst one... he wants me to get rid of Gladys.
Who's Gladys? Oh! What a tragic loss!
Yeah. I really hate to give her up. Oh, I know!! Oh, you should take her!
Well, I-I-I-I... I don't know...
Why, you don't like her?
Well, of course I do. What's not to like! I'll take her in a minute! But, you know, I think that you're giving up too easy, honey. I think that you need to fight for her!
Really? You think?
Absolutely! Yes, you say to him "I'm sorry Mike I can't live without her, she means too much to me!"
Ok, I'll fight for her. Ok! Oh, wait, oh I just realized... if I do that, that means you don't get her.
Damn it, I did not think this through!
Hey you guys.
Hi!
Oh! Any word on casting yet?
Joe, I told you, you're just not right for the part.
What do you mean? Rach, don't I seem like a professor you'd buy some kind of e-crap from?
I'm sorry, this sounds like something I'm never gonna be interested in.
Look, c'mon, please? It's not like I'm asking for some crazy favour. This is what I do for a living. I am a professional actor! Oh, man, I'm two hours late for work! . Look, here's a copy of my reels. It's got all the commercials that I've been in.
Joe...
Just watch it, and if you don't like it, you don't pass it on to your bosses!
Fine!
Thank you.
Work, Joe!
Damn it!
What am I gonna do now?
Just pass it to your boss!
He's not right for the part. So if I suggest him, my bosses are gonna think I'm an idiot! And that's something they should learn on their own!
Just tell Joey that you watched the tape and you liked it, but your bosses didn't. Then that way, you're the good guy and they're the bad guys.
That's good! I liked it, they didn't. Joey, for God's sake, go to work! .
I can't believe I'm about to meet Benjamin Hobart. I've always thought of him as one of the people I'd invite to my fantasy dinner party. Do you think there's any chance he'll bring Christie Brinkley or C3PO?
Sorry, looks like it's just him.
Charlie! My God, you look absolutely stunning!
Well, I... I am having a good hair day.
So good to see you.
Me too.
I'm ok.
I'm sorry... Ross Geller... Benjamin Hobart.
It's an honor to meet you. I can't tell you how long I've been an admirer of your work, I mean, that Nobel prize, whoooo! I mean, I have to tell you that, you're one of the reasons I got into the field.
Oh, well, likewise. Actually, not likewise. I've never heard of you until this morning, but, it's nice to be nice!
Shall we? .
Thank you! . I can't believe that you chose this restaurant! Do you remember the night?
Oh my God, I completely forgot! Oh my God! I can't believe they let us back in this place! .
You weren't there!
No, but, it's, you know, it's just a funny image, you know, the two of you, in this restaurant, with... tzz-zzz, mmm.
Ross, why don't you tell Benji about your proposal, while I go to the ladies room?
So, tell me about it.
Ok well, I would like to do a dig in the painted desert.
M-m.
See, there are still several areas that haven't been fully excavated.
Break up with Charlie!
What?
What?
Did you just say "break up with Charlie"?
Well, yes, and now. Yes I did say it, and no, I didn't not say it.
Kind of inappropriate, don't you think?
I'm sorry. I just haven't seen her for so long! All these feelings are rushing back! I'm starting to realize how much I missed her, and I'm gonna need you to break up with her.
Are you serious?
If you say yes then I'm serious, if you say no then I'm joking!
No!
Joking it is!
Hi! Sorry, I'm late.
Hey, how did it go with Mike, is he gonna let you keep the painting?
No, he really hates it. But he's gonna let me keep my box of human hair! So you got to pick your battles. But the good news is, Gladys is yours!
Wow, what's the bad news!
Who's Gladys?
Oh, she's that work of art I made, you know, with the woman coming out of the frame.
Oh, and Monica gets to keep her? In her house? I am so jealous!
Oh, I didn't know you wanted her too!
Huh!
Well, I mean, sure, of course. But... you already gave that to Monica, so...
You know, I would give her up, for you.
No, I couldn't let you do that.
But I want to.
But I don't want you to.
But I insist!
But I insist harder!
Girls, girls, stop, ok? We'll flip a coin. Heads, she's Rachel's, tails she's Monica's. . Tails! Monica, she's yours!
No, that landed in your food!
No, no, that's ok. You won fair and square. I'm so sad!
Hey Joe!
What's up?
Bad news. I watched the tape and passed it along to my bosses and they weren't interested.
Oh.
I'm sorry man.
But, ehm... you watched the tape?
Yeah! I... I... I liked it! But, ehm... my bosses didn't go for it. Stupid sons of bitches!
You didn't watch the tape.
What!? Of course I did!
Look, it's one thing not to cast me, but to lie to me?
I'm not lying to you, I watched it!
Well, you lied again!
I watched it!
Keep going Pinocchio!
I did!
No you didn't!
I'm telling you, I watched the tape.
Did you watch the tape?
No!
The selection committee has chosen the three of you as our finalists today. The ultimate decision will be based upon the answers you give to the questions I ask here. I'm gonna start with Dr. Li. Dr. Li, you claim the field is too reliant on the Linnaean taxonomic system. How do you propose to correct this problem?
Well, I believe that the answers lie in the osteological evidence. I plan to begin there.
Interesting.
I guess!
Dr. Biely, your proposal includes some field work. Where might that take place?
Primarily in the Pierre Shale region of South Dakota.
Certainly. Very well. And Dr. Geller, when is my birthday?
What? I... I...
Care to venture a guess?
May 12th?
That's not even kinda close! Dr. Li, how many graduate students you'd be needing?
Half a dozen.
I see, and Dr. Biely?
Three for excavation and two for analysis.
Certainly. Dr. Geller, which 1965 Shirelles hit was later covered by a popular British invasion band?
Wha..? I need 6 graduate students.
No! I'm sorry, we were looking for "Baby It's You". Baby It's You.
Wha...? Wait, wait, wait, just a minute. None of my questions have anything to do with Paleontology.
You're right, I apologize. Scratch the last question. Spell "Boscodictiasaur".
um... I've never heard of a "Boscodictiasaur".
Yeah, I just made it up. Spell it.
Ok. B - O - S ...
No, it starts with a silent "M".
Oh come on!!
I can't believe Joey. I hate being called a liar!
But you are a liar.
What did I just say?
You still here?
Yes, and I have to say, I am not just hurt. I am insulted. When I tell somebody I did something...
Ok whoah-hey... Let me just stop you right there, ok? First, you lied, right? Then, you lied about lying, ok? Then you lied about lying about lying, ok? So before you lie about lying about lying about lying about... lying... Stop lying!
Why are you so sure I didn't watch this tape?
You wanna know wh...? You wanna know why?
Well, this is going well.
Here's how I know you didn't watch the tape, ok? If you had seen what was on this tape, believe me, you would have some comments. Alright, now remember, I got paid a lot of money for this and it only aired in Japan.
And that's how I know you didn't watch the tape! .
He really is a chameleon.
Well, Gladys say hello to your new home!
Oh, my!
Wow! Oh, she's so nice and big! Oh, Monica, where are you going to display Gladys oh so proudly?
I haven't really settled on a spot yet!
Well, hey! How about right above the TV? . That way, it will be the first thing that you see when you walk in the door!
Yeah, yeah! And you can get rid of that French poster.
I like that poster!
Really? It doesn't have anything coming out of it. Or maybe there is some place for her in your bedroom?
Oh! There's nothing above your bed!!
Are you still here?
Oh hi! Hello! Uh, have you come to ask me some more paleontology related questions? Uhm... your grandmother's nickname, perhaps? Aunt Margaret's pants size?
I've come here to apologize. I think I may have let my feelings for Charlie interfere with the interview process.
No! Stop!
Anyway, I've decided to offer you the grant.
Really?
Well... there is just one small... stipulation...
I have to break up with Charlie?
Hey, you got one right!
You're crazy.
Crazy, or... romantic?
Crazy!
Ooor...
Get out!
O-oh my God!
What?
Joey, what... is... this...thing... doing here?
I got it from Monica. She sold it to me for a very reasonable price.
Joey, we're not keeping this!
But it's an original Buffay...
Alright, fine. You can keep it. As long as you don't mind that she's haunted.
Hey? what? what? wey! whoo! what? what!?
Well, legend has it Joey, that... she comes alive when you're asleep.
She climbs out of the frame, and then drags her half-a-body across the floor, just looking for legs to steal. And then with her one good hand, she slo-o-owly re-e-a-aches up and turns your doorknob.
GET THAT LEGLESS WITCH OUT OF HERE!
Hey! I sold that to Joey.
Well, why I told him it's haunted. Two can play at this game.
No, too late. You can't give it back!
Yes I can!
No you can't. She's yours!
She's yours!
SHE'S YOURS!
She's yours!
Hey!
She's mine!
She's m-i-i-ne!
She's mine!
She's mine!
You guys! You guys! You don't have to fight over her anymore. Whoever doesn't get Gladys gets Glynnis.
I want Gladys!
She's mine!
She's mine!
She's mine!
She's mine!
Look, I'm sorry I didn't give them your tape. And I promise, next time to submit you whether I think you are right for the part or not.
That's not the point Chandler. The point is that you lied.
I know. You're right. What's it gonna take for you to forgive me?
Oh my God!
Excellent!
Now, what do you say?
Lying is wrong!
And?... AND?
I'm a pretty little girl.
I knew it!
Your ex-boyfriend is insane.
Did you get the grant?
No I didn't, and you want to know why? Because your ex-boyfriend is still in love with you.
What?
Yeah. He wouldn't give me the grant, because I wouldn't give you up.
Benji isn't in love with me. I mean, he broke up with me. And besides, he's a very ethical man.
Really? Is it ethical to ask someone in a grant review, who was the voice of "Underdog"?
I'm sure he was just joking, Ross.
If you don't believe me, let's go talk to him, okay? I'm telling you, he didn't ask me one paleontological question.
Seriously?
Oh, I'm sorry, no. He did ask me one. Uhm... How do you spell Mboscodictiosaur?
Well, if it's like the lake Mbosco in Congo, then M-B-O...
Damnit!
Dr. Geller...? Charlie... What are you... what are you doing here?
I want you to tell her everything. About the deal you tried to make with me, about the crazy questions you... Wally Cox! That's the voice of Underdog!
Like I tried to tell you in the interview Ross, this grant is not based on your knowledge of pretty useless trivia.
No, no, no. Don't do that! I want you to look her in the eyes, and tell her the truth.
Benji?
Alright, it's true. I behaved horribly. But it's only because I still love you. And I would do anything to have you back in my life.
Too little, too late, Benji!
I can't believe this.
I never should have broken up with you. I think about you all the time. I mean, do you ever still think about me?
No!
Yes!
What?
I don't know what to say, Benji. This is all so.... romantic.
or...
Listen, I know, I may be way out of bounds here, but is there any chance you will take me back?
Maybe...
Sweetie, this conversation is starting to make me a little uncomfortable.
Oh God! I am so sorry, but... I mean it's... there's so much history between us, you know...
I'm sorry too...
I love you!
I love you too!
Okay, that's it. WE ARE SEEING OTHER PEOPLE!
Gladys?
Ha ha ha, third time this week. Man, this does not get old.
You're mean!
Oh, don't be such a baby! end.
Hey you guys!
Hey!
Hey, what are you doing?
Oh, figuring out our wedding plans.
That's funny, we were doing the same thing!
Yeah!
It's really crazy! The hall, the dress, the food... I-I had no idea how expensive this stuff was!
Yeah it is really pricey. I mean, I freaked when I first heard the numbers.
So what did you two do about it?
It was pretty simple actually, I came up with a couple of cost-cutting solutions, wrote out a list and Monica told me to go to hell.
There's no way around it Pheebs, you just gonna have to accept the fact that this is gonna cost you a lot of money.
I heard that weddings are like a 40 billion dollar a year industry.
Yeah, and I'm responsible for just like half of that.
But really, it does seem like this money could be put to better use?
Are you serious?
Yeah! Now, how would you feel if we gave all the wedding money to charity and we just got married at City Hall?
I think it would make me wanna marry you even more.
I've got to say you guys, that's an incredible gesture!
Maybe you do that next time you get married!
No, no, no. The next time it's gonna be a Hawaii at sunset. But maybe the time after that!
Hey!
Hey!
What's going on?
Our adoption social worker is coming by today so we are cleaning the apartment.
We?
You know you don't want me to help. You can't have it both ways!
Hey, is this person who decides whether or not you... get a baby?
Kind of. She's coming by to interview us and see where we live.
And it has to go perfectly, because if she doesn't like something about us she can keep us off every adoption list in the state.
Hey, maybe I should stop by! She could be a soap opera fan! It's very impressive when the little people know a celebrity.
Little people?
Celebrity.
Ok, so I think I'm just about done here, unless you have any bad stuff hidden somewhere, like... porn or cigarettes?
What...? NO!
Chandler?
I don't, and I'm offended by the insinuation!
Ok, so there's not a magazine under the couch, or a pack of cigarettes taped to the back of the toilet tank, or a filthy video in the VCR?
I'll admit to the cigarettes and the magazine, but that tape is not mine.
It isn't mine!
Well, I guess we'll never know whose it is!
May I help you?
Yes. We're here to make a rather sizeable donation to the children.
Well, any contribution, large or small, is always appreciated.
Well, I think you're gonna appreciate it the crap out of this one.
Well, this is very generous!
And we don't want any recognition. This is completely anonymous.
Completely anonymous. From two kind strangers.
Mr. X and Phoebe Buffay.
Well if you like, we can include your names in our newsletter.
Not necessary.
Buffay is spelled B-U-F-F-A-Y.
And "X" is spelled uhm... "Mike Hannigan".
Right. Well, on behalf of the children: thank you both very much.
Sure, I so glad we did this. It feels so good!
It does. It feels really good!
Oh, look! And we get these free t-shirts!
Oh, actually, that's the shirt I wore to the gym.
Mhm... it's moist.
Hi!
Hi! Emma will be up in a minute!
Oh, good!
Oh hey Ross... Listen, I heard about you and Charlie. I'm really sorry.
Oh, that's OK. I'm sure there are tons of other beautiful paleontologists out there.
Absolutely.
There was one! She's it! All the rest look like they should live under a bridge!
So, uhm... what are you gonna do today?
Well, I was thinking of taking Emma to the playground!
Oh my God, what!?
Like I said I was thinking of taking Emma to the museum of knives and fire!
Ok, look, Ross. I do not want Emma going to the playground.
Be-caaauuuse...
All right, well, if you must know... I had a traumatic... swing incident... when I was little.
Seriously?
Yes, I was 4 years old and I was on the swing and then all of a sudden my hair got tangled in the chain. And to get me out my mom had to-had to cut a big chunk of my hair! And it was uneven for weeks!
And you made it through that? I wonder who's gonna play you in the movie!
Ok, fine! You can make fun of me. I do not want Emma going there. And I was thinking Claire Danes.
Look, I'm sorry to hear about your tragedy, ok? But the swings are perfectly safe, and besides Emma loves them. You know what, you should come with us and you'll see!
Ross, those things go like 40 miles an hour! Ok? When you're... and there is that moment when you are at the top, when you just don't know if you're gonna return back to earth!
Space is filled with orbiting children. Look, please, just come on, you know, when you'll see the look on Emma's face, I swear you won't regret it.
All right!
Good, you don't want to be one of those mothers who pass on their irrational fears on their children, do you?
Irrational, huh? All right, well, I'll remember that the next time you freak out about a spider in your apartment!
Oh, yeah, that's the same, I am sure there are thirty different species of poisonous swings!
Oh my God, the adoption lady is early!
Ok, ok, here we go.
Ok.
Here we go. Stand up straight. Big smile.
Hello, is this the creepy residence?
We're waiting for the adoption lady, but, hey, I'm glad you're here. I was cleaning this morning and I found this . I don't know if you wanna use it, but...
Awe, this is so sweet of you! But you know what? I won't be needing a veil, I actually won't be wearing a dress at all!
I told you! I am not coming to a naked wedding!
No, no, no, we're not having a big reception, we took the money we were gonna spend on a wedding and we donate them to the children charity.
That's crazy! . I am sorry. I just can't imagine giving up my one wedding day like that!
We, you know, we're different! We don't care about having a huge party. This is really nice for you, but, oh, please, I put this on? And, ow, I look , why, well, radiant. All right, well, who cares, I don't need a pretty veil and a fancy dress.
That's right. You're making a commitment and that's the same, whether you do that at the Plaza or, where are you gonna do it?
City Hall.
Ow! Oh, that sounds nice! I am just there for jury duty. They really spruce that place up!
It's ok, it's ok. I made my decision. What I really want is a great big wedding.
Yay!
But you already gave all your money to charity!
Well, I'll just ask for it back!
I don't think you can do that!
Why not! This is her wedding day, this is way more important than some stupid kids!
That's sweet, honey, but save something for the adoption Lady.
Ok, careful.
Ok.
Careful, watch her hair. WATCH HER HAIR!
Rach, she's got like three hairs!
I know but they're just so beautiful! Oh, my God, I just pulled one out.
I promise you she's safe! No watch how much she loves this.
Ok.
Ready sweety?
Ok.
Here we go!
Ok, careful, ok. Oh, she's smiling! Oh my God, she does like it!
See, I told you!
Awe! Oh my God! Looks, she's a little dare-devil! Oh, let me push, can I push?
Oh, absolutely!
Ok. Oh God. Get the camera, it's in the diaper bag.
Ok! See? Scared of swings, I bet you feel pretty silly Ow!
We're seriously asking for our money back?
It's for our wedding day! Right, now, is this guy gay or straight, because one of us gonna have to start flirting.
Wow! Are you here to make another donation the same day? I don't think that that's ever happened before.
Gay, go.
Oh my God, I love your shirt!
The donation we made earlier, we k..., we w..., we want it back.
Excuse me?
Yeah. See, that money was for a big wedding, that we thought we didn't want, but it turns out we do.
So you're asking us to refund your donation to the children?
Yeah! This feels really good.
I am sorry. I am, but this wedding is just really important to me.
Hey, it's not my business, besides it's probably a good thing. We really would have been spoiling the children, all those food, and warm clothing...
Hey, that's not fair! A person's wedding is important! And especially to me! Ok? I didn't have a graduation party! And I didn't go to Prom. And I spent my sweet sixteen being chased round a tire yard by an escaped mental patient who is his own words wanted to "kill me" or whatever. So I deserve a real celebration and I am not gonna let some sweaty little man make me feel badly about it.
She could have been talking about either one of us.
Hi, I am Laura, I am here for your adoption interview.
Hi, I am Monica and this is Chandler. Please come in.
Thank you!
Would you like something to drink?
Oh, water would be fine.
Ok. Great. I am so glad that you are here. We're really excited about getting this process started.
Oh, because we love kids. Love 'em to death.Well, not actually to death, that's just a figure of speech - we love kids the appropriate amount... as allowed by law.
Your place is just lovely.
Ah, thank you. This building does have a wholesome family feel to it.
You know, I... I feel like I've been here before. Are any other couples in the building adopting?
Is that that couple on the first floor? Because we should get a baby before them. Yeah! That guy tried to sell me drugs.
But other than that... wholesome, wholesome building.
Oh...
What?
I just realized why I remember this place.
Really? What is it?
Oh, it's nothing. I went on a date with a guy who lived in this building and it didn't end very well.
Ohh... that wouldn't by any chance be... Joey Tribbiani?
Yes!
Of course it was!
Yeah, we had a really great night and in the morning he promised he would call me and he didn't.
RAT BASTARD!
So you're not friends with him?
OH GOD NO! Nope, no, no, no. No! No, no. Nope! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. NO! No!
Well, I'm sorry I brought it up. So, are either one of you planning on staying at home with your child...
Hellooo? Anybody in there order a celebrity? OW!
What was that?
Oh, it's just some crazy guy who roams the halls here. He's great with kids though.
Oh, oh Ross, oh my God, are you okay?
SON OF A BITCH! Oh relax! I didn't say the 'F' word!
Ross, see! I told you, those swings are evil! Alright, that is it. That is the last time Emma is getting on one of those things for her entire life.
No! No, no, no, no, okay, it wasn't the swing's fault. It was my fault and kind of that kids fault. Who is still laughing. Nice.
Ross, c'mon, please. Can we just get out of here, before somebody else gets hurt?
No wait, okay, okay, I have an idea. I want you to get on the swing, okay? And you'll see that there's nothing to be afraid of.
I know what this is all about... You've always been jealous of my hair.
Look, I just think you're an adult, okay? And you should get over your silly fears.
Alright fine. I'll do it.
Good.
If you hold a spider.
WHAT? WHERE? WHERE?
IF you hold a spider.
I know.
Guys? Everything ok? It's me, Joe...
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA......AAAaaa-doption!!
What's going on?
Oh, just like I said. That crazy... Bert... roaming the halls.
Guys!?
Keep on roaming Bert! We don't want any crazy today!
What's going on?
WE'LL TALK TO YOU LATER, BERT. EVERYTHNG'S FINE!!
Everything doesn't sound fine!
Is he alright out there by himself?
Oh yeah! He has a caretaker. His older brother... Ernie.
Bert and Ernie!
You can't make this stuff up!
You never told me about that guy on your sweet sixteen. Oh, ugh. I'm sorry about that.
Oh! It ended okay. One of my friends shot him.
Well, hey, at least you're getting a proper wedding. I mean, you really deserve that.
Yeah, I really do. You know, I had nothing growing up. Just like the kids I took the money from.
No! No, no. I see where this is going. Don't make me go back there.
Look, I can't have a wedding with this money now. It's tainted.
Alright, fine. We'll give the money back.
And if that guy at the charity gives us a hard time, my friend hasn't shot anyone in a really long time.
We're back!
Are you here to take more money? Because, I think what you're looking for is an ATM.
No, no, we're here to give the money back.
Yeah, because you know what, it's... it's all about the children.
Although... it's also about the wedding... Ugh, alright... here. No... Oh God... Oh!
If I haven't said so already sir, congratulations!
Ok, look! Enough! Alright? I'm stepping in. I'm putting my foot down! As your future husband I'm going to make this decision for us. Now... what do you think we should do?
You know what? It's not your decision anymore.
What?
On behalf of the Children of New York, I reject your money.
But... but... but we're giving you this!
Yeah... And I'm giving it back to you... Come on! Consider it a contribution.
Well, this is very generous!
Please, take the check, go have a great wedding and a wonderful life together.
Well, I mean... It sounds good to me. And that way we can save up, come back in a few years and make an even bigger donation.
Absolutely! And when you do, make sure you ask for Brian.
Oh, is that you?
No!
Hello...? Oh hi... Oh my God...! Really...? I can't wait to tell Chandler... Ok, goodbye.
Wrong number?
It was Laura... She gave us a great report and we are officially on the waiting list.
That's great!
Now we just have to wait for a call and... and someone tells us there's a baby waiting for us. Oh...
Hello...? Have you seen Joey's bat?
Ok... I got a spider. There were two, I picked the bigger one.
Ok...
Ok...
This feels perfectly normal. Ok, get on the swing!
Ok... O-k...
Ok...
whoo... ok... wow... ok... OH!
See?
A-alright! I can do this.
There you go! Good for you! And you know what, I'm actually getting used to this little guy. I don't really even feel him in here anymore.
That's because he's on your neck.
Well... Whaa... aaah... aaahhh...
ROSS! end.
Hey guys!
Hi!
Hey!
We need to talk to you about something.
Yeah. We don't feel like we can host Thanksgiving this year.
What?
Hey!
Are you kidding?
Well, it's just with uhm, work and the stress of adoption, we just don't feel like we have the energy. Plus, we don't think it's fair that every year the burden falls on us.
That doesn't sound like you... That's Monica talking!
No, no! We made this decision together.
She's putting words in your mouth!
Don't you put words in people's mouths, you put turkey in people's mouths!
I can't believe this! This is Emma's first Thanksgiving!
No, it's not!
It's not? When was she born?
Well, personally I think it's great you're giving yourself a break.
Thank you, Pheebs!
Sure. It's just as well... I mean, last year wasn't very good. I think she's losing her touch.
What? You are way off, lady!
Am I? Really? Am I? Well, why don't you cook Thanksgiving dinner and prove me wrong! Well, think about it, think about it, you'll be trying to top than you did last year. You'd be in competition... with yourself.
That's my favourite kind! Okay, we are doing this!
Don't let yourself get manipulated this way!
Hey, stay out of this, Chandler! This is between me... and ME!
We are supposed to make these decisions together! Did you not watch the Doctor Phil I taped for you?
Hey!
Hi! Happy Thanksgiving!
Oh, yeah, happy needless-turkey-murder day.
You guys, I ordered some chocolate pies from that bakery on Bleecker. Could you pick them up for me?
You're not making the pies yourself?
No, no, no, I don't make chocolate pies. When I was younger I-I enter in this pie-eating contest. I ate so many that just the thought of them made me sick.
Did you at least win the contest?
2 minutes, 12 pies and a part of one tin! Okay, I see you guys at 4.
Can't wait!
This dinner is gonna be so great! In your face, last year "me"!
Hey Rach.
Yeah.
What's Emma doing today?
Well, let's see... uh... I know that she has a meeting with her lawyer and then she has to make a very big poop. Why?
Well, I wanna enter her in a baby beauty pageant.
Oh my God! That's the creepiest thing I've ever heard!
Okay, but, well, before you say no, my friend Susanne is entering her kid and compared to Emma she's a real dog!
Oh! Phoebe, all babies are beautiful!
Oh... okay.
Phoebe, just the idea of pitting one baby against another, I mean, you know, and judging who's cuter just for a trophy...
And a thousand dollars.
...is something I'm very interested in! Oh please, do not tell Ross. He still believes that what's in the inside is important...
Okay, oh, and Emma needs a cowgirl outfit for the competition.
Where am I gonna get a cowgirl outfit on Thanksgiving?
Well, I was thinking...
Oh, take the clothes of Joey's Cabbage Patch Kid.
Yeah!
Did someone drop the baton again?
Why come all the way from Kansas to do that?
I don't get older. I just get better!
You know what just occurred to me? This could be our last Thanksgiving just the two of us. I mean, we could be getting a baby soon!
You don't know that.
Somebody is gonna pick us.
Yeah, but we haven't heard a thing from the adoption agency and it has been weeks!
I'm telling ya! It's gonna happen. Next year it's gonna be you, me and the little Hemingway Bing. What, he's my favourite author!
Name one of his books.
"The Firm"?
Ok, let's see... uhm, okay, the turkey is in the oven, the stuffing is ready...
You know, you always cook this meal all by yourself. Let me help this year.
Oh, Chandler, that's sweet. But you don't have to do everything Doctor Phil tells you to do.
I'm serious, let me do something, just not the turkey or the stuffing, nothing "high profile".
Ok, let's see... Oh, the cranberry sauce, it is easy to make and no-one really cares about it.
Tell me more.
Okay, I'm gonna go check on something across the hall. You start by washing these Not with soap!!
You obviously haven't tasted my Palmolive potatoes!
Hey! Hey, guess what Joey has!
Three tickets to today's Rangers game!!
Dude, I wanted him to guess.
Oh.
Oh my God!
Yeah, they're great seats too!
Guess where they are?
Center ice.
Did I do something to you?
Hmm, the game's at one.
So?
Dinner is at four, we'll never gonna make it back.
So we'll leave before it's over, we'll be back in time.
You say that now, but it could take us a long time to get back home. Plus Joey could get lost and and they could have to page us to go pick him up.
Dude, two times that happened!
Look, Monica has been working hard all day, she didn't wanna host this thing in the first place, we shouldn't go!
He's right, man.
Right, I guess. Alright, so see you at four.
Okay. And get ready to taste my very special cranberries. Or should I say... chanberries!
That's some gentle comedy, dude.
We're still going at the game, right?
Yeah!
Yeah.
This is contestant number sixteen, Rebecca...
Hey.
Oh Phoebe, listen. Well, I think we gotta go. This place is really freaking me out. I've been watching this guy over there, I don't think he came with a kid!
We can't leave now! There was this one baby, Haley, who was favourite to win and she got croup, so she had to stay home! This competition just blew wide open, folks!
Phoebe, I think... It's just too weird, I just saw a one year old running around with pantyhose on!
Oh, I know, we should have been more prepared. It's okay. Now, the way I see it, our real competition now is Cameron. Oh my God, they just took her sweater off. Look at those arms! Hello Michelin Man.
Oh, Phoebe! Come on! You know what, it's already three o'clock and they haven't even gotten to Emma's group yet. We gotta go, we got dinner!
But Emma's got what it takes, she could go all the way!
Phoebe, you have to calm down.
Okay. Rachel, the hottest babies in the Tri-State Area are in this room right now! I overheard one of the judges say that not one of them holds a candle to Emma!
Really?
Yeah!
You heard them say that?
Yeah!
All right, okay. Alright, let's give to these babies something to cry about!
Good! Oh yay! Let's get down to business! Emma needs some makeup!
No, what?
Well, she's gonna look all washed out next to the other contestants!
No Phoebe, I am not letting you put makeup on my baby!
Why not!
Because I already did!
Oh, Bob, get off the guy!
Oh! What a game, huh?
I know, yeah.
I can't believe Chandler is missing this!
Yeah. I am sorry he's not here too, but I got to say, I am really enjoying Nacho Chair.
Yeah, I'd probably enjoy it more if you didn't keep batting my hand away.
Ohhhh! These seats are great!
I know, I know! When I was here for Holidays on Ice I was sitting so far away Michelle Kwan couldn't read my banner!
Wow, hey, we'd better get going. If we don't leave right now, we'll be late for dinner.
Oh, but it's a kind game! So we're a little late, you know, the girls will be there, let's stay just for one more goal.
I don't know...
One more fight!
Okay.
Okay.
Where is everybody? They're forty-five minutes late!
I can't believe they are not here! I slave and I slave for what? They've ruined cranberry day!
How late are we?
Forty-five minutes.
Wow.
Here!
Okay. Rachel and Phoebe are already there, okay? So they probably started without us. We could just slip in and no-one needs to know where we were!
You may want to lose the foam finger!
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. You just want to put it on your hand!
Hey!
Oh!
You are not at Thanksgiving?
No...
No, we're late!
What are you doing here!
We're late too!
We figured we could be late because you guys were gonna be on time.
Don't point that thing at me, Tribbiani!
So, nobody's here? Monica's gonna kill us!
Yeah, where were you!
Yeah, yeah, what's with the trophy!
Uh, we were at the Spelling Bee!
And I won!
You won an adult Thanksgiving day spelling bee.
Yes! Y-E-S. Yes!
Let me see this... Grand Supreme Little Darling, New York Division.
Yeah. That's me!
You entered Emma into a Beauty Pageant?
And it looks like she put makeup on her!
Wait a second, wait a second, where have I seen that cowgirl outfit before...
I can't believe this, she's our daughter! That you would treat her like some kind of showdog is inexcusable!
She won a thousand dollars!
So this is an annual thing?
Oh! That's Alicia Mae Emory's outfit!
You guys, there are people in there who are not getting any happier!
Yeah. What are we gonna do?
Well, I don't know, you guys figure it out, I got to put Emma down for a nap.
All right. Hey Rach, while you're in there, throw something on Alicia Mae.
Alright, what are we gonna say?
Ooh, we'll say that we were mugged! You can't get mad at someone who's been mugged!
Oh, good, that's good, but you don't look like you were mugged!
No. Here.
HEY!
Do you hear something?
They're out there!
Ohhh! Let me see! Oh God, I can't believe this! They're an hour late and they're just staying out there, talking!
Everything is so distorted! Looks like Joey has a giant hand! Which says "Rangers" on it. They went to the game!
Oooh! They are in for a world of pain!
Ross' shirt is torn.
Oh! They're late and they're sloppy!
Alright, Emma is napping... what happened to your shirt?
I got mugged. And they stole my pocket.
We're just... we're trying to figure out an excuse. Hey! Ooh! How about this: We can say that Monica told us 5 o'clock, not 4 o'clock. That way we're right on time! OR... or, we can plant PCP in the apartment and call the cops on her.
That would be a good way to get rid of all the PCP we have lying around.
You know what, we just say that she said it was 5 o'clock. We'll just act casual. We're not late, we're right on time.
We know you're out there.
Who do you think its from?
Oh, God. This is bad. This is so bad.
Well, let's just go in there and face them.
Well, I'm not going in first. I bet that vein on Monica's forehead is popping like crazy.
I hate that thing, it's like a... bolt of lightning.
Oh, hey, I have an idea. Why don't we play rock-paper-scissors, and whoever loses goes in first. Ready? .
Ah-haah! I win!!
What is that?
That's fire. Beats everything.
Oh, really? Does it beat water balloon? .
Ooh! Well played, Phoebe Buffay, well played.
Alright, enough, enough, come on. Let's just all go in at the same time.
Alright, okay.
It's locked.
Wha...? Oh sure, now they lock it, but when they're having sex on the couch, its like: "Come on in, my butt is surprisingly hairy".
Alright, come on... Alright, you guys. We're so sorry we're late. Please let us in, so we can have dinner together.
No! Everything's cold. The turkey's dried out and the... the stuffing is all soggy.
Yeah, and there's a bowl of cranberry sauce that... what happens to cranberry sauce?
Nothing. It's fine.
Oh thank God!
Come on you guys, we're sorry, alri...? Our subway broke down.
That's a lie, you went to the game, I can see Joey's hand.
FOR THE LOVE OF GOD TAKE IT OFF!!
You guys, come on, it doesn't matter why we're late. We're all here now, please let us in so we can have some of your delicious turkey.
I had a dream once about a fax machine that did that.
That's all the turkey you're gonna get.
How are we gonna decide who gets this?
WATER BALLOON!
What are we gonna do? I'm starving.
Oh, I just remembered. We do have something to eat. Monica put something in our oven this morning.
Oh yeah!
Hey, you touch that and you will be sorry.
Guys, I'd listen to her. The vein is bigger than I've ever seen it.
Huh... OH MY GOD IT'S BRUSSELS SPROUTS.
That's worse than no food.
HA-HA! All you got was Monica's stinky Brussels sprouts!
Stinky?!
Please let me stay on this side of the door.
Oh, I know... I still have my old key! We can just unlock the door.
Well, I don't know if that's such a good idea. They clearly don't want to be with us.
You know what? I don't want to be with them either, but it's Thanksgiving and we should not want to be together, together.
Just get in there and make a face to face apology, you know? Look them in the eye. I know I can get them to forgive us.
I don't know...
I'm telling ya... I can do it.
Yeah, he can do it!
Oh!
Oh! It all looks so beautiful: the turkey, the stuffing...
The cranberries...?
Oh! Enough! A monkey could have made 'em!
Hey listen guys, we feel really terrible.
He's doing that weird eye contact thing. Don't look at him, don't look at him!
Come on you guys, we want you to know we're very very sorry. Right guys?
I feel terrible.
So, so sorry.
Now let's not ruin this day. You worked so hard. Let's move past this and try to have a nice meal all together, huh?
The floating heads do make a good point.
Yeah, they do seem to feel pretty bad.
So bad.
So bad.
So bad.
Okay, okay. You two go get the dessert. And I'll let you in.
Dessert?
Yeah, I asked you and Phoebe to pick up the pies. You did remember, right?
Pies, oh, we thought you said priiiize . Here! .
Grand Supreme Little Darling?
Congratulatioooons!
Oh my God! YOU FORGOT THE PIES? Well, I cannot believe this. You force me to make dinner, then you're an hour late and you forget the one little thing that I asked you to do.
Really girls, not cool.
Well, you manheads aren't any better. You lied about going to the game. You knew it would make you late, and you still went anyway.
Hey! I'm getting a little tired of this okay? We said we're sorry. It's Thanksgiving for Pete's sakes! A day of forgiveness!
It's a day to be thankful.
Don't make me come up there!
It's too late for apologies.
Fine! Let's just go. I don't need your stupid dinner.
That would be a lot more convincing if you weren't drooling.
Ewww, is that what that is?
Sorry!
Come on you guys, let's just do our own Thanksgiving.
Yeah! I'll cook!
Yeah! Let's go out.
Hey!
Yeah! You three have a nice Thanksgiving.
The three of us?
Yeah! You, Chan, and the vein!
Ha!
Oh-oh! I'm stuck!
Joey, that is not gonna work.
No seriously... I'm really wedged in here.
I'll pull you through.
Okay.
aaw-ahhh-aaahhh STOP! STOP! I'm worried about damaging my head.
A little late for that.
Alright, hurry up, you gotta do something.
Alright, well, this does not change anything. Okay, we need to get something to grease the sides of his face.
Uhm, we've got turkey grease.
Bring it.
I just wanna say that I'm sorry I referred to the vein as a seperate person...
Here you go!
Oh, that smells good!
Okay.
Okay, try it.
It isn't working.
Alright, we're gonna have to unscrew the chain.
Well hurry, I can't feel my ears!
Can you ever feel your ears?
Interesting...
Chandler, where are your tools?
Oh, I left them on my bulldozer... I don't have tools!
I do, but Rachel borrowed them.
I lent them to Ross.
I gave them to Joey.
I left them at the park.
Oh!
I'm finding it really hard not to mess with him.
I've already stuffed a bunch of Brussel sprouts down his pants.
Nice!
Okay, I have to get that. Now when I get back, I want you and your friends to be gone. Thanksgiving is over. The Vein has spoken.
It's really starting to hurt.
Okay, look, I'm gonna pull on the door and you guys push as hard as you can. Maybe we can get enough room to wiggle him out, okay? Okay, so PUSH!
Just a sec., we're kind in the middle of something here.
Ooh! Stop putting things down my pants!
Come on guys, PUSH!
Yeah! Come on!
PUSH! PUSH! PUSH!
My cranberries!
Man, I've got food all over me.
Argh! I can't believe what you did. Monica's gonna kill you!
Look! Look! Look what the... Look what... Look what the floating heads did!
I don't care.
What's going on?
That was the adoption agency...
And?
WE'RE GETTING A BABY!
Are you serious?
There's a pregnant woman in Ohio, and she picked us!
I'm so happy for you!
This Thanksgiving kicks last Thanksgiving's ass!
To Monica and Chandler... and that knocked up girl in Ohio.
I'm just so happy you guys are finally getting a kid.
I know. Have you considered pageanting?
I can't believe they called, and we're actually getting a baby.
Oh, I know how you feel...
Really?
Sure. I went through the exact same thing with Alicia Mae Emory... The waiting, the wandering... Then one day... I get that call from Toys "R" Us... She was in stock!
That is the exact same thing.
Hi!
Hey!
Hey!
We're just here to say goodbye, we're off to Ohio.
Oh, right! Your adoption interview!
Yep, we're gonna meet the lady who could be carrying our baby.
I can't believe it. When you guys come back, you're gonna have a baby! That is so weird!
And so incorrect!
She's only a couple of months pregnant. She liked our application but who knows if she's gonna like us.
Come on, she's gonna love you guys!
Uhm, thank you, but we're really trying not to get our hopes up.
And a lot could still get in our way.
Yeah. I mean, this girl could decide against adoption or she could like another couple better..
What are you gonna name the baby?
I can develop a condition in which I talk and talk and no one hears a word.
But just think, ok? What if everything goes right? What if this woman does pick you guys?
Oh my God. She's gonna pick us!
So we're standing firm on the 'not getting our hopes up'?
You know, I know that things could still go wrong but if they don't? If this works out, we're gonna have a baby Chandler, a baby!
Yes, but...
Oh my God, it's gonna WORK! We're gonna make it work! I'm gonna be a mummy and you're gonna be a daddy! All right, I'll see you suckers. I'm gonna get me... A BABY!
Oh, screw it, I'm gonna be a daddy!!
Hey, who's Phoebe with?
I'm gonna say someone I'm gonna have sex with. Hey!
Hey!
So... who's your friend?
Oh, that's Sarah. No, no. Don't you get any ideas, ok? No, I'm not setting you up with any more of my friends!
OW, why, why, why?
Because you'll date her once, sleep with her and then forget she exists!
Oh, name one friend of yours that I did that with.
Mandy.
Mandy, uh? Uh... really hot blonde, big boobs?
No.
I know why I don't remember her, huh?
Do you think I'm someone else?
Ok, I may not have treated your friends well in the past, but I have grown up a lot, really. Honest, Rach?
Well, believe it or not, it's true. When Joey and I were together, he was wonderful. He was thoughtful and mature. And for the one week that we went out, he didn't sleep with anybody else!
Growth!
Fine, I'll give you her number.
Ok, thank you. And I promise you I will not forget this one. Mandy.
SARAH!
Saraaah.
Hey!
Hi!
Hey you guys, I need some fashion advice.
Oh!
How does this look?
Well, it's a little low... pick up a little... a little bit more... a little bit more... There you go! Now throw it away!
C'mon! This looks good!
Ross, please, trust me. I buy 30 fashion magazines a month. Now, I don't know who's running for president or who that... NATO guy is, but I do know that you have to get as far away as you can from that hat.
Damnit! I have this date tomorrow night and I have to look cool!
Well, you know, if you want fashion help, Rachel and I are going shopping tomorrow. You're more than welcome to come with us, right?
Really? That would be great. I mean, I have to do something, she kinda teased me about how I dress.
I can see why, nice shirt!
You're wearing the same shirt.
Stupid Gap on every corner!
Please, make yourself comfortable and I will back in a moment with Erica.
Ok, thank you. Uh, well this is it. Are you OK?
Yeah. Just weird, you know. It's like: "Hi, I'm Chandler. May I have the human growing inside you?"
Uh, we're gonna be great.
You're gonna be great.
Well... obviously!
Monica, Chandler. I'd like you to meet Erica.
Hi. It is so, so nice to meet you.
Hi...
Thank you so much for agreeing to see us.
Hi.
I'll let you get acquainted.
Ok.
So, it's Monica and Chandler. I only know you as file 0W33815-D.
That's what our friends call us.
Gosh, you know, you're just such an amazing couple. It's... kind of intimidating.
I don't know about that.
You're kidding me? I mean, it's enough that you are a doctor. But on top of it, you're married to a reverend?
I don't think that's exactly...
Let her finish, doctor.
Hey!
Hey.
Oh, my friend Sarah had a great time last night.
Well...
Yeah! So you're gonna call this one back?
Nope.
What are you talking about? Sarah's great!
Oh, really? You know what your great friend did? We're out to dinner, ok? We're getting along, having a really nice time. I was thinking she was really cool. And then, out of nowhere...
That's it? That's why you won't go out with her again? So, she took some fries, big deal!
Hey, hey, look! It's not about a few fries... it's about what the fries represent.
What?
ALL FOOD!
I'm sorry, I can't believe I set you up with such a MONSTER!
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Look. I take a girl out, she can order whatever she wants! The more, the better! All right? Just don't order a Garden salad and then eat my food! That's a good way to lose some fingers!
Oh.
Hi.
Thank God you're here. Listen to this!
what?
Joey and my friend were out last night and having dinner and she reaches over and takes a few of his fries...
Oh! Oh, no!
What? You know about the plate thing?
Oh, yeah. Joey doesn't share food. I mean, just last week we were having breakfast and he had a couple of grapes on his plate and ...
You wouldn't let her have a grape?
Oh no! Not me! Emma!
JOEY DOESN'T SHARE FOOD!
Well, I still think that it's a stupid reason not to call someone again. You are calling her! And if you need to, just get an extra plate of fries for the table!
I like that! A sharing buffer! Yeah! I'll order some extra fries! Maybe a plate of onion rings. Yeah. And a shrimp cocktail. And some buffalo wings. Maybe an individual pizza, uh? And some mozzarella sticks. What were we talking about?
This place is awesome!
You know, we should just go, I'm not gonna find anything here! This stuff is ridiculous!
Ah, this place is great!
Wow!
Rach, come on, I'm not gonna wear any of this! Nothing silver. . Ok? Nothing with hair! And nothing with padlocks on it! .
Ross, look, I know that some of this stuff is out there, but I mean, come on, look at this, look at this sweater! . I mean, this is just beautiful!
Wow, this is really soft . Three hundred and fifty dollars?
Yeah, down from seven hundred, you are saving like two hundred bucks!
Both logic and math are taking a serious hit today. Phoebe : Hey, check this out! It's totally you!
Wow!
Yeah!
Actually this looks like pretty good! Yeah! Boys will be boys?
What? They will be!
All right, that's it, I'm getting out of here.
No, no, no, no! Ross, wait! Come on! You know, there's other stuff. Here's a nice shirt, look at these nice pants...
Uh, actually these might look pretty good on me.
Yes, they will! You know what you should do? Just go take a walk, all right? I know your size and I'm... I'm gonna pick up some really good stuff for you.
Really?
Yes! And I know what looks sexy on guys. Please, just wear what I suggest, and she's gonna go nuts for you.
So, you're saying, uh, if I wear these pants I might be getting into hers?
Why do men keep talking to me like this?
So, the fact that I am a doctor, and my wife's a reverend, that's important to you?
Yeah, I read some great applications, but then I thought "who better then a minister to raise a child!"
Amen.
Plus I thought the baby would be in good hands with a doctor!
Uh, good hands. Healing hands.
Reverend, can I ask? Does the bible say anything about adoption?
It says "Do it!". And behold she did adopt onto them a baby. And it was good.
Wow.
Yeah, wow.
I was wondering you both have such serious jobs. Would you have time to take care of a baby and your flock?
Oh, you know, my flock is good, I mean, yeah, my flock pretty much takes care of themselves at this point. Good flock. Flock, flock, flock.
Being a doctor must take up a lot of time.
No-ot for me it doesn't.
So, how's everything going in here?
We're great, I think I may have asked all my questions.
Do you have any question for Erica?
Yeah, actually. So, you read a file that you liked and you gave the agency the serial number and they contacted us?
Yes, our system assures total anonimity. We're very proud of it.
You should be. You're really on top of stuff..
Well, then if there's nothing else, then the two of us should talk.
Actually, I don't think we have to.
We don't?
Yeah, when I read about you two, I was pretty sure I wanted you, but I just thought we should meet face to face. . I've made my decision. I choose them.
Oh my God, this is great! This is so great! . Did you hear that?
Yeah, I did.
Hey, thank you. Thank you so much. . You are SO going to Heaven!
We got some really great stuff!
Yeah, yeah but I am not sure about some of the bra's I got.
Oh! Really? Do you wanna try some of them on for me?
Oh! okay. Wait, are we in Joey's imagination?
Oh no! I took one of Ross' bags by mistake, and one of mine is missing.
oh, well, Ross probably has it, you can get it from him later.
So? What do you think?
I think were not wearing the same shirt anymore!!
Yeah! Yeah! Rachel picked it out for me. She told me to trust her and you know what? I'm glad I did! I turned quite a few heads on my way over here.
Dude, I really don't think you should be wearing that.
Oh, I see, somebody is afraid of a little competition with the ladies?
Looks like someone IS the ladies!!
You're just jealous because you couldn't pull this off. Yeah, now if you'll excuse me I have a date. See? ALL eyes on ME!
We are NOT signing those papers.
Why not?
It's wrong. They made a mistake. They think we're somebody else.
God works in mysterious ways.
You have gotta stop!
But she liked us.
She likes Doctor Chandler and Reverend Monica.
Well, if you think about it, I am kind of like a Reverend. I mean, as a chef, I serve God, by feeing the hungry and poor.
Your Veal Chop is $34,95!
C'mon Chandler, I think we have been given an opportunity. I mean, the mistake has already been made. They are writing up the paper right now.
But we are not the one she chose! How can you feel okay about this?
Because... We may not be who she thinks we are but no-one will ever love that baby more than us.
I know..
I mean, who knows how long it's gonna take for someone else to give us a baby? What if, what if no one ever picks us?
oh, honey..
Please.. please, we are so close.
Monica, I want a baby too, but this woman is giving away her child. She deserves to know who it's going to.
okay, right.
So, we'll tell the truth and who knows, maybe she'll like us for us.
Maybe she will. Uh! Why couldn't I have been a Reverend?
You're Jewish.
Technicality!
A garden salad for the lady.
Oh, that looks great! Good ordering!
Seafood platter for the gentleman and extra fries. Enjoy!
Mmmh, those fries look delicious.
oh, I didn't know you liked French fries. Help yourself! What's mine is yours.
Oh wow, are those stuffed clams?
Uuuh.. yes, they are my stuffed clams.
How about those fries though, huh?
They are delicious.
You are beautiful, you know that?
Oh, that is so sweet..
Oh okay..
NOW look what you did!!
What? what is the matter with you?
I don't like it when people take food off of my plate, okay?
But you just said "What's mine is yours"?
WELL, I DIDN'T MEAN IT!
Fine, I'm sorry, I didn't think it was that big a deal.
I'm sorry, I'm overreacting. Okay, It's just when it comes to food, I have certain rules, okay, I mean There are things you do..and you now, things.. that you don't do .
Wow, this place looks great.
Oh! You are gonna love it! and I'm so glad, we're finally doing this.
Me too!
Here So this was fun!
I really am sorry about, you know..before. I just want to make sure you know that I really do like you.
Sure Just not as much as clams.
Well, stuffed clams.
Chocolate Torte for the lady, cheesecake for the gentleman.
Uh, excuse me sir, there seems to be some sort of red crap on my cheesecake.
Yes, that's Raspberry coule.
So stupid, ordering cheesecake, trying to be healthy.
Oh my God!
Oh, all right, I'll just have what she's having instead.
Oh, I'm sorry sir, that was our last piece.
Mmmm! Mmm!
Oh, no! This is work. I should call in. Can you excuse me?
Oh yeah, sure. No problem.
What are you doing? I thought you don't share food.
Sure I do. Coule?
No. If I can't have your clams, you can't have my dessert. This is a two way street.
Really?
Really! Now this all better be here when I come back.
Yeah, of course. I can control myself.
Stop staring at me!
Why, just a tiny little...
Oh-oh! TIME LAPSE.
I'm not even sorry.
Hi!
Hey.
Hey.
So, these are the preliminary forms for an open adoption. There's a lot to go over, but I'll explain everything as we go through it.
I-Is... Is that a picture?
Yeah. It's a sonogram they took of the baby last week. I thought you might want to see it.
Look, doctor! Look, before we sign anything we really have to talk... We're not who you think we are.
I don't understand.
The agency must have made some mistake. My wife is not a reverend and I'm not a doctor.
What?
That's impossible.
I could perform an operation on you and prove it if you'd like.
I'll go check your file. Excuse me.
So who are you?
Well, our names really are Monica and Chandler. We're from New York.
Yeah, but the important thing to know about us, is how much we would care for this little baby.
So you lied to me before?
Well, we... "bore false witness"... See I could be a reverend.
I can't believe this.
But we were hoping that since we told you the truth that you still might consider...
Giving you my baby? You think I'd give you my child after this?
Well, you don't have to decide right now, but if you could just look at our file...
I don't want to look at your file! This is over.
Erica wait!
I've nothing to say to you.
You have every reason to be upset. We did lie. But only because we've been waiting and trying to have a baby for so long. Now we don't know how long it's gonna be before we can get another chance again.
Why don't you ask the reverend to pray on it?
Erica, please. Just consider us. Ask them to see our file. Our last name's Bing. My wife's a chef and I'm in advertising.
Oh yeah. I actually liked you guys. But it doesn't matter, because what you did was wrong.
But you did like us. And you should. My wife's an incredible woman. She's loving and devoted and caring. And don't tell her I said this but the woman's always right... I love my wife more than anything in this world. And I... It kills me that I can't give her a baby... I really want a kid. And when that day finally comes, I'll learn how to be a good dad. But my wife... she's already there. She's a mother... without a baby... Please?
You still want that baby?
God bless you Chandler Bing!
Turns out this sweater is made for a woman.
So, why are you still wearing it?
Because it's soft... Hey, so how was your date?
Ooh... Not so good.
Well, looks like it's just the two of us tonight, huh old buddy?
Yeah, and you know what? We could do a lot worse.
JOEY DOESN'T SHARE FOOD! end.
Mmh... this cake is amazing!
My God, get a room!
I would get a room with this cake. I think I could show this cake a good time!
If you had to, what would you give up, food or sex?
Sex!
Seriously, answer faster!
Oh, I'm sorry honey, you know, but when she said "sex" I wasn't thinking about "sex with you"!
It's like a giant hug.
Ross, how about you. What would you give up, sex or food?
Food.
Ok, how about... uhm... sex or dinosaurs?
Oh my God. It's like Sophie's Choice.
Oh God. What about you, Joe? What would you give up, sex or food?
Uhm... oh... I don't know, it's too hard.
No, you gotta pick one!
Oh... food. No, sex. Food! Sex! Food! Se-I don't know! Good God, I don't know, I want girls on bread!
You gotta see these latest pictures of Emma.
Oh, how cute!
Yeah.
Oh, she looks just like a little doll!
Oh, no, no. That is a doll.
Oh, thank God, 'cause that thing's really creepy! Look, there's Chandler.
Oh. Who is the blonde, she's pretty.
OH! He's having an affair.
He's not having an affair!
You know, I'm always right about these things.
No, you're not! Last week you thought Ross was trying to kill you!
Well, I'm sorry but it's hard to believe that anyone would tell a story that dull just to tell it! See, there's something going on with them. Look, he's getting into the car with her!
Oh, that doesn't mean anything.
Oh yeah? Well, let's see. Ok, duck down.
Hello.
Oh, hi Chandler. It's Phoebe. Uhm... I know that Monica is working today so... ...I was wondering if you want to come to the movies with me and Rachel.
Oh, uhm... I have to work too. Yeah, I'm stuck at the office all day.
Oh, well, it's a shame that you-that you miss the movie 'cause we were gonna see, you know, either "Liar, Liar" or "Betrayal", or... "An Affair To Remember".
Those are all really old!
Ok, then maybe it'll be, uhm...
"Dude, Where's My Car?"
What?
They're in a caaar...
Okay, we-we'll talk to you later. Okay, bye.
Geez!
Ok. Quick. We gotta find a cab and follow them.
Oh, yeah, ok. Let me just grab my night vision goggles and my stun gun.
I got them!
Hi!
Hey! You smell like perfume and cigarettes.
I was in the car with Nancy all day.
Nancy doesn't smoke!
Well, at least the perfume is not mine, be thankful for that!
So? What do you think of the house?
It's perfect. It's everything we've been looking for.
Isn't it? Then what about the amazing wainscotting and the crown molding and the dormer windows in the attic?
And the wiggle wharms and the zip zorps? What were the things you said?
Don't you love the huge yard?
And the fireplace in the bedroom.
And Nancy said that it's really under price, because the guy lost his job and has to move in with his parents!
This is bringing out a lovely color in you!
So? Do you think we should get it?
I don't know. What do you think?
I think we should.
I do too.
This is huge!
I know.
How bad you wanna smoke, right now.
I don't know what you mean, giant talking cigarette! Oh, by the way, Phoebe called just as I was getting into Nancy's car, so if she asks you, I was at work all day.
Gotcha. When do we tell them about this?
We don't. Not until it's a hundred percent. I mean, why upset everybody over nothing.
Okay. Right. Oh my God that is gonna be so hard.
I know. Gooooood luck with it.
I just can't see Chandler cheating!
I'm telling you guys, we followed them out to a house in Westchester, the went in for like forty-five minutes and then they came out looking pretty happy!
Chandler? Forty-five minutes? Well, something is not right. I just can't believe he would do this to Monica!
I know, and with the baby coming?
So, should we tell her?
I don't know. Phoebe, if one of us saw Mike with another woman would you want us to tell you?
Why? Who'd you seen him with?
No one, I'm just saying if...
TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW!
I know nothing! Mike's a great guy, it was hypothetical!
All right. . He is a good guy. You're right, he wouldn't cheat.
Believe me, if I did see with someone, there's no way I...
WHO DID YOU SEE HIM WITH?
Oh, look at her, so happy!
If only there were a smaller one to clean this one!
Hey, is uhm... is Chandler here?
No, he's picking up dinner, why, what's up?
Well, look, whatever happens, we're here for you and we love you.
All right...
We think Chandler might be having an affair.
What?
Phoebe and I saw Chandler with a blonde woman today outside on the street and then we followed them to a house in Westchester.
They went in together. So sorry.
Oh my God! Oh my God that's awful! What did you think of the house?
What?
Monica, you understand what we are saying, right?
Yeah, sure... uhm, I'm devastated, obviously... Did you think the neighborhood was homey?
Hey!
You son of a bitch!
Is it me, or have the greetings gone downhill around here?
Phoebe and Rachel saw you with Nancy today and... em... they think you're having an affair.
Who's Nancy?
What's going on?
Ok, alright, you guys, you'd better sit down, this is pretty big.
Yeah I'm not having an affair. Nancy is our realtor.
I knew he couldn't be with a woman for 45 minutes!!
Why do you have a realtor?
Uhm, she has been showing us houses outside of the city.
What?
Are you serious?
When we found out that we're gonna get this baby, Chandler and I started talking and we decided that we didn't want to raise a kid in the city.
So you're gonna move?
Oh my God.
Shouldn't we all vote on stuff like this?!
What is wrong with raising a kid in the city? I'm doing it, Ross is doing it, Sarah Jessica Parker is doing it!
And that's great for you guys, but we want a lawn and a swingset...
...and a street where our kids can ride their bikes and maybe an ice-cream truck can go by.
So you wanna buy a house in the 50's?
Have you thought about what you would be giving up? You can't move out of the city, what if you want Chinese food at 5am? Or a fake Rolex that breaks as soon as it rains or an Asian hooker sent right to your door?
You know what, if you wanna look for a house, that's okay.
No, no, it's not, don't listen to him! I'm gonna thump you!
It's ok, because they have to get it out of their system, okay , but you're going to realize, this is the only place, you wanna be.
Actually, we already found a house we love.
What?
And about an hour ago, we made an offer.
Bet you wish I was having an affair now, huh? TIME LAPSE.
You put an offer on a house?
It's so sweet. It really is. It has this big yard that leads down to this stream and then there's these old maple trees...
Wha..? Again with the nature, what are you? Beavers?
I know this is really hard and we're really sorry.
Is this because I come over here without knocking and eat your food? Because I can stop doing that, I really, really think I can!
You know that's not the reason Joe.
We think if you saw it, you'd understand. I mean you guys were there. It is beautiful, isn't it?
Yeah it is.
What the hell are you doin'?
Well, it is, all right? When we were out there today, all I kept thinking was: I can't believe Chandler is screwing this woman, but MAN this would be a nice place to live!
Yeah, but so is this.
Yeah, I mean, if you moved there, you have to leave here. I mean, how can you leave this place?
C'mon Daddy, listen to me! All of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I don't want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying that I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!
You can see where he'd have trouble.
Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.
Well, I guess we've established who's staying here with Monica...
That money is mine, Green!
You're fly is open, Geller!
You guys, you know what I just realized? 'Joker' is 'poker' with a 'J.' Coincidence?
Hey, that's...'joincidence' with a 'C'!
Eww, look. Ugly Naked Guy lit a bunch of candles.
Ow, that had to hurt!
Hey, it's your Thanksgiving too, y'know, instead of watching football, you could help.
We will.
Okay, Rachel, you wanna put the marshmallows in concentric circles.
No Mon, you want to put them in concentric circles. I want to do this.
Every year.
It's stuck!!!
Easy. Step. How did it get on?
I put it on to scare Chandler!
Oh my God! Monica's gonna totally freak out!
It smells really bad in here.
Well, of course it smells really bad. You have your head inside a turkey's ass!
Hey, did you get the turkey bast-Oh my God! Oh my God! Who is that?
It's Joey.
I got it! How about, if we win, they have to get rid of the rooster?
Oooohh that's interesting.
If you win, we give up the birds.
Dah!!
But if we win, we get your apartment.
Oooooh!
Deal! TIME LAPSE.
What was Monica's nickname when she was a field hockey goalie?
Big fat goalie.
Correct. Rachel claims this is her favorite movie...
Dangerous Liaisons.
Correct. Her actual favorite movie is...
Weekend at Bernie's.
Monica categorizes her towels. How many categories are there?
Everyday use.
Fancy.
Guest.
Fancy guest.
Two seconds...
Uhh, 11!
11, unbelievable, 11 is correct.
Chandler was how old when he first touched a girl's breast?
14?
No, 19.
Thanks man.
Joey had an imaginary childhood friend. His name was?
Maurice.
Correct, his profession was?
Space cowboy!
Correct! What is Chandler Bing's job?
Ow...Oh Gosh!
10 seconds, you need this or you lose the game.
It's umm, it has something to do with transponding.
Oh-oh-oh, he's a transponce-transpondster!
That's not even a word!
NOOOOOOOOO!!!!! TIME LAPSE.
Y'know what, you are mean boys, who are just being mean!
Hey, don't get mad at us! No one forced you to raise the stakes!
That is not true. She did! She forced me!
Hey, we would still be living here if hadn't gotten the question wrong!
Well it stupid, unfair question!
Don't blame the questions!
Would you all stop yelling in our apartment! You are ruining moving day for us!
Chandler!!! Chandler!!! Chandler, I saw what you were doing through the window! Chandler, I saw what you were doing to my sister! Now get out here!
Wow! Listen, we had a good run. You know, what was it? Four? Five months? I mean, that's more than most people have in a lifetime! So, good-bye, take care, bye-bye then!
Hey Ross. What's up bro?
What the hell are doing?!!
Hey, what's-what's going on?!
Well, I think, I think Ross knows about me and Monica.
Dude! He's right there!
I thought you were my best friend, this is my sister! My best friend and my sister! I-I cannot believe this!
Look, we're not just messing around! I love her. Okay, I'm in love with her.
I'm so sorry that you had to find out this way. I'm sorry, but iit-t's true, I love him too.
My best friend and my sister! I cannot believe this.
Well, this is the last box of your clothes. I'm just gonna label it, "What were you thinking?"
Funny, because I was just gonna go across the hall and write that on Chandler.
Ok, you guys, I don't mean to make things worse, but umm, I don't want to live with Rachel anymore.
What?!
You're just so mean to each other! And I don't want to end up like that with Rachel. I still like you!
Well, Phoebe that's fine because I'm not moving.
Whoa-whoa-whoa, Phoebe you gotta take her! Y'know, I-I-I said some really bad stuff about her, but y'know Rachel has some good qualities that make her a good roommate. She gets tons of catalogs and umm, she'll fold down the pages of the things she thinks that I'd like.
What else?
When I take a shower, she leaves me little notes on the mirror.
Yeah, I do. I-I do, do that.
That's nice. I like having things to read in the bathroom.
When I fall asleep on the couch after reading, she covers me over with a blanket.
Well y'know, I don't want you to be cold.
And when I told her that I was gonna be moving in with Chandler, she was really supportive. You were so great. You made it so easy. And now you have to leave. And I have to live with a boy!! TIME LAPSE.
Hey.
She really left.
I know.
Thank you.
No problem roomie.
Can I ask you a question?
Sure!
What the hell is that dog doing here?!
Little toast here. I know this isn't exactly the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.
That's so sweet.
And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas.
And a crappy New Year.
Here, here!
You can't move. You just... you just can't.
Rachel's right. This is where you guys belong.
Yeah, you don't wanna live in Westchester. That's like the worst of the Chesters.
You know, sometimes when I'm alone in my apartment, I look over here and you guys... are just having dinner or... watching TV or something, but... it makes me feel better. And now when I look over, who am I gonna see? The Gottliebs, the Yangs? They don't make me feel so good.
Yeah. So don't move, okay? Just stay here and... maybe close your blinds at night.
Hello? It's Nancy, they responded to our offer.
And?
Okay, thanks... They passed. They said they wouldn't go a penny under the asking price.
We can't afford that.
I know.
Well, there you go.
I'm really sorry you guys.
Yeah. I'm sorry too. I'm even more sorry that that phone call didn't come before I told you about looking through the window.
Yeah, we're gonna let you be alone.
You're gonna be okay?
Yeah, we'll be okay.
Love you guys.
You know, I'm really sorry I wasn't more supportive before.
That's okay, we understand.
And about this Nancy thing... If you're not sleeping with her, should I?
I know there'll be other houses, but it's just so... I love that one so much.
Yeah... Well, it's a good thing we got it then.
What?
We got the house.
Oh my God!
I just didn't want to tell you in front of them.
Oh my God! My God! We've got the house !?
We're getting the house. We're getting the house.
And a baby...
We're growing up.
We sure are.
So who's gonna tell them?
Not it!
Not it! Damn it!
Rachel, this is yours.
Aah! Why? What are these for?
You'll see.
All right, everybody open them!
Ooh! Oh wow this is so beautiful.
Oh! These are the ones I was looking at in the store.
I know.
I love this.
A meatball Sub? Thanks!
Seriously you guys, what's going on? What are these for?
Well, I didn't know how to tell you before, but... We got the house.
Enjoy!
What did they say?
Hey guys!
Hey, let me tell them!
Sure.
Joey is gonna be a celebrity guest on a game show!
Great!
Really? Which one?
Ohh! Fish, seaweed, a sunken ship.
Things you find in the ocean, You're gonna be on "Pyramid"!!
Oh, that was our favourite game show ever!
Except for "Match game"...
Or "Win, Lose or Draw".
What did I marry into?
Would you guys want to come down tomorrow and watch me tape the show?
Oh, I can't. We're throwing Phoebe a bachelorette party.
Yeah, sorry boys, this ride's closing.
Oh, and Chandler and I have this stupid college alumni thing. I can't believe you get to meet Donny Osmond.
Seriously?
Yeah-uh!
Ross and I always wanted to be Donny and Marie.
You guys just keep getting cooler and cooler!
Yeah, we used to perform for our family and friends.
Oh God, that's right. I blocked that out.
"I'm a little bit country"...
"...and I'm a little bit rock 'n' roll"!
I'm leaving you.
So weird to see all these people again... Oh my God, look, there's Geoffrey Cleric.
Who?
He was roommates with John Rosoff. He went out with Andrea Tamburino. She dumped him for Michael Skloff.
Did I go to this school?
Hey, there's Missy Goldberg. You gotta remember her.
Sure, nice.
Dude. You're married to my sister.
You're right, by saying "nice" I'm virtually licking her.
Hey, I hear she's single again, d'you think I should ask her out?
Are you asking permission to break the pact?
Yes please.
Hey. Hey, check out the flyers for the band. I made 'em on a Macintosh in the computer room!
Awesome, the name really stands out.
Thanks to a little something called "Helvetica Bold 24 point"!
Man, we're gonna rock that Asian student union!
Hey guys!
Hey!
Hey, Missy...
You know, our band is playing on Friday.
Yeah, yeah. You should come check us out. We're called "Way! No Way!".
No way!
Way!
Right. I'll be there.
Fresh!
Boss!
Mint!
She's gone.
I know it. You know, I'm totally gonna ask her out.
Dude, I was gonna ask her out.
I said it first, bro.
Well, I thought it first, Holmes.
Look, if you did...
Woha! Wait... What are we doing? What we have is too important to mess it up over some girl. I mean, we can get laid anytime we want.
Totally. I had sex in High school...
Me too. I'm good at it.
All right, I'd say we make a pact. Neither of us will go out with Missy Goldberg.
You got it.
All right, so that's Missy Goldberg, Phoebe Cates and Molly Ringwald, who neither of us can go out with.
Those are the pacts!
Oh, and Sheena Easton. But we probably couldn't get her anyway.
Oh, oh... maybe not you!
Well, I officially give you permission to break the pact.
Thank you. All right, here I go. Hey, remember how scary it used to be going up to girls in college?
Your hands are shaking.
I know, and I can't stop sweating.
Five! Four! Three! Applause!
Yeah! Welcome, it is Soap Opera week here on Pyramid, let's meet our contestants. First, Gene Lester is a database specialist, he's gonna be playing with "Days of Our Life's" star Joey Tribbiani!
I know it could be intimidating for regular people to be around celebrities but... relax, I'm just like you! Only better looking and richer.
...should be playing with the star of "General Hospital" Leslie Charleson. Welcome everybody. Good luck to all of you. Let's play Pyramid. All right? Now... we flipped a coin before the show, Gene, you won the toss, so you're gonna start. Which category would you like?
I'll take "You crossed the line".
You crossed the line. Joey, describe for Gene these things that have lines. Give me 20 seconds on the clock, please. Ready, go!
Uhm... ok. It's a store, like a supermarket. Oh! I see-I see what I did. Yeah, ok, ok, uhm... I'm writing in my...
Diary.
Noo, more like a notebook... Damn it! Oh, if I'm building an house, the plan isn't called the 'shmoo-print'... Can't say that either? Woha... hey... In high school, I once had sex with a girl right in the middle of the...
Cafeteria.
Yeah! But that is not what they're looking for. OOOH!
Thank you so much for this.
Oh, d'you like it?
Oh my God, it's all so elegant! When's the dirty stuff starting?
What?
You know, the strippers, and the guys dancing, and you know, pee-pee's flying about.
Pheebs, I... there isn't gonna be any flying about! We actually thought we were a little too mature for stuff like that.
Oh, ok. I see what you're doing, that's fine. This is all there is, just tea, uh, ok. Hmmmm... raunchy!
Seriously Pheebs, it's not gonna be that kind of a party.
Really? So this is... this is my big send off in the married life? Rachel this is the only bachelorette party I'm ever gonna have! I've got a big wad of ones in my purse! Really? I mean, really? It's just tea?
Nooo! Phoebe, of course there is more! I mean, I'll just go and talk to Monica and get an ETA on the pee-pee's!
Now Gene I must remind you, you need all six of these to stay in the game, all right? Describe for Joey things you find in your refrigerator.
Ahaha, he might as well just give us the points.
Give me twenty seconds on the clock. Ready? Go!
You put this in your coffee.
A spoon. Your hands. Your face!
It's white!
Paper, snow, a ghost!
It's heavier then milk!
A rock, a dog, the earth.
Pass!
You put this on a sandwich.
Salami, anchovies, jam!
It's white!
Paper, snow, a ghost!
It's made from eggs!
Chickens?
Pass!
Oh!
You put this on a hamburger!
Ketchup!
Yes!
Relish!
Stop!
Oh.
Oh, time's up! Joey! You were, uh, almost on a roll there...
Yeah...
Uh, Gene, you're gonna have a chance to go to the winner circle in the second half. But right now Henrietta you are going to the winner circle to try your luck for ten thousand dollars, right after this, don't go away.
And we're out!
Oh, so we didn't win, but it's fun to play the game, right?
Hey! I got a kid starting college. I've to get surgery on my knee, you just lost me ten grand!
Oh, wow! I'm so sorry, ok? I promise, we'll do better next time!
Well, I will, because I won't be playing with you.
Hey, you know, some of those are pretty hard! Like why would there be a ghost in my fridge? . Yeah!
So, Saturday night!
I'd love to!
Great!
So how come it took you so long to ask me out?
Oh, well, uh, this is gonna sound kinda silly, but, do you remember my roommate Chandler Bing?
Sure, he was in your "band"?
It's been sixteen years but the air quotes still hurt.
Sorry.
That's ok. Uh, anyway, well he and I both really liked you a lot, uhm, but we didn't want anything to jeopardize our friendship, so we kinda made a pact, that neither of us could ask you out!
Really?
Yeah, why?
Well, Chandler and I used to make out! A lot!
You did?
Yeah. We'd go to the science lab after hours!
AND ON MY TURF?
Hey, where is this guy, it's been over an hour!
Well, he's coming from Jersey, he said he would get here as fast as he could!
Who is it?
It's the police!
Uh! The police!
Oh!
That's right, it's officer Goodbody.
What's the matter, officer? Has someone been bad?
Whoo, that's a lot of stairs!
Ooh, boy. You should warn people there's no elevator! I should not have had that Mexican food for lunch.
Are you gonna be ok, officer, uhm,...
Goodbody!
...If-you-say-so.
So where's the young lady who I'm supposed to take downtown!
Oh, God!
All right, somebody show me where to plug in my box, and we'll get this party started! Whaaaa... Here? All right.
Rachel?
Yeah?
Are you kidding?
All right, look, we did not know that you wanted a stripper so we went to the phonebook and we got the first name we could find!
How old is your phonebook?
Oh my God, this man is gonna get naked in my apartment!
Oh God no, I don't wanna see him take his clothes off!
Are you talking about me?
Oh, no! I mean, obviously we want to see you take your clothes off! You big piece of eye candy!
Ok, ok, ladies! Can I have your attention, please? Did someone call for the long arm of the law? I should warn you, I have a concealed weapon! I hope you're familiar with the States penal code, ok, ok, enough teasing. Now for some pleasing!
Whoa, whoa, whoa . She cringed!
This is how I look when I'm turned on!
You were talking about me before! Look, I don't need this! I'm outta here! Where's my hat? Look, I've been in this business for a long time!
Shocking!
Now if you just pay me my three hundred dollars, I'll be on my way!
Three hundred dollars, are you kidding?
No, that's ok, let's me just get my check book!
No, you're not gonna pay him, he didn't do anything!
Didn't do anything? I took a bus all the way from Hoboken. I climbed ... I dunno... like a billion stairs... It's not like I can take them two at a time!
I don't care. We're not paying you 300 dollars for this.
Well, look - it's not my fault if you're too uptight to appreciate the male form in all it's glory.
Oh yeah, okay. I'm uptight. Yeah, that's why I don't want to watch a middle aged guy dance around in what I can only assume is a child halloween costume!
I may have borrowed this from my nephew, but let me assure you, what's underneath ... is all man.
I'm sorry, did you say all man or old man?
Oh, you're mean!
Uh, look, officer... uhm Sir...
Damnit. OH! Big surprise! The hunk of beef has feelings!
Ok Henrietta, you've picked Jack and Jill went up the hill.
My friend Rachel has a kid. I totally know nursery rhymes!
Joey describe these things associated with the United States congress. Give me 20 seconds on the clock please. Ready? Go!
Oh, .. uh... uh... pass. Pass. Pass. Okay, the little thing that hangs down at the back of your throat.
Uvula!
Oh, then pass.
O-kay... Henrietta, you didn't get all the points you needed, so that means Gene, you are going to the winners circle to try for ten thousand dollars! And you're gonna be going there with Joey Tribbiani.
You made out with Missy Goldberg. How could you do that, after you promised me?
Excuse me. . That didn't make us sound gay at all!
You broke the pact!
Ross, that was 16 years ago!
That doesn't matter! We're talking about the foundation of our friendship.
I believe the foundation of our friendship was unfortunate hair. All right, look, if we're really gonna do this... it's not like you never broke one of the pacts.
I didn't.
Oh really?
No.
Oh really!?
NO!
ADRIENNE TURNER!!
Yes?
Hey! Hey Adrienne.
I never did anything with Adrienne Turner.
Oh please, and you knew how much I liked her.
I don't know what... you're talking about.
Really?
Remember that big party? Freshman year? A week before Christmas vacation? I do. You had some visitors.
I can't believe we are at a real college party! I have to pee so bad!
This is so awesome! College guys are so cute!
Hey, you've got a boyfriend!
I know. But if some guy who looks like Corey Haim wants to kiss me tonight, I'm sooo gonna let them!
Look, there's Chandler. You knew, that stupid friend of Ross'. Said I'm fat. You know I've already lost 4 pounds!
It... You can so totally tell.
I KNOW!
Well lets see. Maybe he knows where Ross is. Hey, how's it going .
Aren't you...?
Yeah, Rachel. And this is Ross' sister, Monica. We met at Thanksgiving. .
Right. So how're you doing?
Bitchin'
Hi Monica.
Hi Chandler. It's really nice to see you NOT.
O-kay. I'll see if I can find Ross.
Oh my God Rach. Bean bag chairs.
Oh.
Do NOT let me sit in one of those. We'll be here for days.
Listen Adrienne, you can't tell Chandler about this.
Oh believe me, Ross, I won't be telling anybody about this.
Cool!
I didn't know you knew about that.
Well, I did and it hurt. That's when I wrote the song: "Betrayal In The Common Room".
Man... I... I'm sorry.
Look it was a lo-o-ong time ago.
So, eh. I made out with Adrienne and you made out with Missy. Well I guess we're even.
Hmm mmmhm..
We are even, right?
Just one more thing. I was so pissed at you that night that I wanted to get back at you. So I thought, who does Ross like the more than anybody?
What did you do to my mom?
Not her!
I am sooo drunk.
That's weird. I've had the same number of beers as you and I don't feel anything at all.
Soo... you girls having fun?
For your information, ass munch, I've lost four pounds. Maybe even five with all the dancing.
SOMEBODY ORDER A PIZZA?
Oh THATS ME!
I am soo not going to do good on my SATs tomorrow.
Well maybe if you go to school here next year we can totally hang out.
Oh yeah. There is a plan! Why don't I just start taking my smart pills now?
Well, maybe you can get in on a beauty scholarship.
Oh, what a line.
So where are you applying to?
Oh well, You know, I think it's kinda really important that I go somewhere where there's sun, so I'm sort of... Hey!
I'm in college and I'm in a band.
Yeah okay.
What's the matter? You never saw a 50 year old stripper cry before?
You know, it's fine. We'll pay you.
No, no, you're right. Who am I kidding? I should have hung up that breakaway jockstrap years ago. What am I gonna do? I mean, this has been my life for thirty two years. Taking my clothes off in front of people is all I know.
No, wait. No there's gotta be something else that you can do. I mean, what skills do you have?
I don't know... I can make my pecs dance... I can pick up a dollar bill with my butt cheeks... I can go to that special place inside me where I feel no shame.
So maybe something in an office.
Or you could teach stripping. You know, share your gift, pass the torch.
You know, actually that's not a bad idea. I can do it out of my apartment. I don't think my mom would mind.
There you go. Okay, do you think you're gonna be okay?
Yeah, yeah, yeah... This is so weird. I mean, you never know when it's gonna be your last dance. And I didn't even get a chance to finish it.
Finish it!
What?
Your last dance. Do it for us.
Really?
Really?
Yeah, yeah. He deserves to do the thing he loves one last time.
Okay, all right... Get ready ladies!
Oh this is so ho-o-ot!
Oh no, no, no, don't stop!
Have to...
Well, welcome to the Winner Circle. Joey and Gene, you guys ready?
Yeah...
Sure.
Okay. Give me sixty seconds on the clock please... Ready, GO!
Oak, maple, elm, birch...
I-I-I don't know. Types of trees?
Uhm... Buenos dias, enchilada, por favor...
Oh, I'm so sorry. I don't know any Spanish words.
A match, a candle...
Things that go "tssst" when you put them out.
A torch, a bonfire... uhm, your pee...
Things that burn.
"I'd like to go for a walk", uhm "scratch my belly".
Dude, dude! I think you're losing it.
Uhm, "I have fur", "I like to bark".
Oh, oh, oh... What a dog says.
Pepperoni...
Pizza toppings, next!
Cindy Crawford, Christie Brinkley, Heidi Klum, Claudia Schiffer...
Oh, oh, oh...
Christie Turlington, Kate Moss...
Girls Chandler could never get?
Supermodels!
Where?
Hey, where's Rachel?
She and Phoebe took the stripper to the hospital.
Did you know Chandler kissed Rachel?
What? When was this?
Nineteen Eighty Seven. The weekend you guys visited me at school.
Oh my God! That's wild!
Yeah, but it was like a million years ago, so it doesn't matter.
Well, it matters to me.
Why?
Because... the night you kissed Rachel was the night I kissed Rachel for the very first time.
You kissed her that night too?
Two guys in one night? Wow, I thought she became a slut after she got her nose fixed.
Seriously, where did this happen?
Okay, after you told me she was passed out in our room, I went in there to make sure she was all right. She was lying on my bed, all buried in peoples coats. Well, I went to kiss her on the forehead, you know. But it was so dark, I accidentally got her lips. I started to pull away, but then I felt her start to kiss me back. It was only for a second, but... it was amazing. And now, now I find out that you kissed her first.
Oh wait... What bed did you say she was on?
Mine.
I'm pretty sure I put her on my bed.
No, she was definitely on my bed.
Why would I kiss a girl, and then put her on your bed?
Well, then who was on my bed?
OH! Oh, oh!
NO! No, no!
YES!
You were under the pile of coats?
I was the pile of coats!
OH MY GOD!
You were my Midnight Mystery Kisser?
You were my first kiss with Rachel?
You were my first kiss ever?
What did I marry into?
Oh, crap!
Oh, hey Joey.
Uh, hey.
Listen, I need to ask you something. Ok, you know how my step dad's in prison.
Yeah.
Yeah. Well, uhm... listen he was supposed to get a weekend furlough, so he'd come to the wedding tomorrow, but he just called and... uhm... well, apparently stabbing Iceman in the exercise yard just couldn't wait till Monday.
So he can't come?
No, and so there's no one to walk me down the aisle and... well, I would just really love it if you would do it.
Seriously?
Yeah, you've... you know, sort of been like a dad to me. I mean, you've always, you know, looked out for me and shared your wisdom...
I am pretty wisdomous.
So... what do you say?
Are you kidding? Phoebe, I would be honored.
Oh, thank you. I hope... I hope you know how much you mean to me.
Listen, I hope... that you know... I don't want you to see your father cry, GO TO YOUR ROOM!
Oh.
Oh no, no, no, let your dad get this.
Oh, it's my wedding planner. She's driving me crazy! Hello... Hey, ok, stop screaming! Ok? So, halibut. All right, so salmon, either way. I don't-I don't... it doesn't matter to me!
Well, it matters to me!
Well, I don't care, so you pick!
Did you just hung up on me? All right, look, I need you at the rehearsal dinner tonight at 1800 hours.
Uh-uh. Ok. What time is that.
You don't know military time?
Why, I must have been in missile training the day they taught that.
Just subtract twelve.
Ok, so... 1800 minus twelve is... one thousand, seven hundred and...
Six o'clock!
Ok.
Ok. Hold on. Geller here! No! I said it has to be there by 4 o'clock. Goodbye. Oh, how hard it is to make an ice sculpture?
Ice sculpture? That sounds really fancy! I told you I just want a simple wedding.
Please... honey, leave the details to me. Now I wanna make this day as special for you as I can. Now, ok, I was thinking that the harpist should wear white.
What harpist? My friend Marjorie is playing the steel drums.
Ooh... she backed out.
She did? Why?
I made her. Steel drums don't really say "elegant wedding". Nor does Marjorie's overwhelming scent.
Hey! She will shower when Tibet is free.
Hey!
Hey!
You look great. I'm so glad we're having this rehearsal dinner, you know, I so rarely get to practice my meals before I eat them.
Okay, what did we say was your one gift to us?
No stupid jokes. I thought that was for the actual wedding.
Rehearse it!
Hi!
Thanks for coming you guys.
Oh, hey, oh... I... I was-I was going for a hand shake.
Is that why your hand is pressed against my crotch?
That is why!
Yeah.
So Rach.
Yeah.
Where is Emma?
Oh, Monica made me send her to my mother's. Apparently babies and weddings don't mix.
Are you still crying about your damn baby? Pheebs, you gotta keep the line moving, remember, 20 seconds per person. Your see these clowns all the time!
Hey, you're Mike's parents, right?
Yes, we are.
Ah, our little ones are growing up fast, uh?
How's that?
You know, on the one hand you're happy for them, but on the other hand it's hard to let go.
Who in God's name are you?
Hey, I'm not that fond of you either, ok buddy? But I'm just trying to be nice for the kids!
You know what I just realized? We have no idea what we're doing in the wedding tomorrow.
Yeah, I thought we'd be groomsmen, but wouldn't they have asked us by now? When did they ask you to be their bridesmaid?
Uh... November?
I wanna say it's not looking good.
Hey Pheebs...
What's up?
Uhm... you haven't told these guys what they're doing in the wedding yet.
Heh.
Uhm... well, they're not in the wedding.
What?
Well, this is really awkward Oh, and I can leave!
I'm sorry you guys but, you know, Mike's got his brother and his friends from school so... you know, you were-you were... if it helps you, you were next in line, you just-you just missed the cut.
Oh, man!
This is like figure skating team all over again. I mean synchronized swimming. I mean- I mean the balance beam. Help me!
FOOTBALL!
Thank you.
Pheebs, spit that out, that has pork in it.
Oh! I though the pot stickers were supposed to be vegetarian!
Yeah, I changed them. I-I sent you a fax about it!
I don't have a fax machine.
Ah, well then there are gonna be a few surprises!
I can't believe we're gonna be the only people that aren't in this wedding.
I know, I hate being left out of things.
And it's a wedding! It'd be weird if I'm not in it...
Hey guys, how is it going?
Fine. We're just sitting here. Alone. Doing nothing. It's our rehearsal for tomorrow.
Yeah look, about tomorrow, I... I've got a question for ya. I just found out that one of my groomsmen had had an emergency and can't make it.
What happened?
Who cares, AND?
...and I was wondering if... you know, maybe one of you guys...
I'll do it!
M-Me-me-me!
You both wanna do it? Uhm... there's only room for one.
Pick me, I look great in a tux and I will not steal focus.
No, Mike, no, no. You wanna pick me, I mean... watch! Huh?
You know, I really don't feel very comfortable making this decision. You know, Phoebe knows you better, I'm gonna let her choose.
Well, if Phoebe's choosing, then say hello to Mike's next groomsman.
Oh, I will. But I will need a mirror... as he is me!
Please, you're going down!
You are going downer!
Is that what they say on the Figure Skating Team?
I wouldn't know, I didn't make it!
So, you know I'm filling in for Phoebe's step dad, tomorrow, right?
Yeah, yeah. Hey, thanks for doing that.
Oh, hey, my pleasure. So what are your intentions with my Phoebe?
I intend to marry her.
Oh, a wiseacre. . No, no, no, I understand you plan to support your wife by playing the piano? Isn't that kind of unstable?
No more so than acting.
Strike two!
You're right. She probably will support me. Hey, unless we move in with you, dad?
Strike three! You only get one more, Mike!
So, what did you decide?
I decided to pee.
Mike didn't tell you? You have to chose one of us to be in your wedding. One of his groomsmen fell out.
Oh no, no. I can't choose between you two! I love you both so much!
Just not enough to put us in the original wedding party.
Oh, I don't wanna choose! It's . Oh okay, wait. Rach! Listen I have a very special bridesmaid task for you today.
Goody, what is it!
Well, there's a spot open for only one groomsman and you have to choose between Ross and Chandler. So good luck with that.
What, what, what, no, I don't wanna do that.
All right, I guess I'll have to find a new bridesmaid.
I'll do it!
Ok, it's 2100 hours. Time for your toast.
Do I have a minute to go to the bathroom?
You had a bathroom break at 2030. Pee on your own time, Mike! . Now, in regard to the toast, okay, you wanna keep them short, nothing kills a rehearsal dinner like long speeches. Okay. You just get in, do your thing and get out!
Is that what you say to Chandler?
It's 2101 and I am not amused. . Ok, the bride and groom have a few words they'd like to say.
Ok. Hello everyone and thank you all for being here tonight. So tomorrow's the big event and some of you might not know, but Mike and I didn't get off to the best start. . My friend Joey and I decided to fix each other up with friends so I, I... oh I... hum... I gave it a lot of thought and I fixed him up with my friend Mary Ellen who couldn't be here tonight because... it's not important... she is in rehab. Anyway, so, ok, Joey said that he was fixing me up with his friend Mike, only he didn't have a friend Mike so he just brought, uhm, my Mike and, and but despite, you know... it got... it got good. Ok, I wanna take a moment to mention my mother, who couldn't be here...
oh God.
And... moment's over! So, ok, uh, I can forget that. I can forget that and uhm... Oh this is funny! Oh, but you need to know that to... that, to... Oh, ok, well, uhm, I . Ok, ok, I, ok, I.... MONICA I CAN'T DO IT LIKE THIS! THIS IS MY WEDDING! OKAY, I DON'T WANT THIS OR THIS OR THIS OK? I JUST WANTED A SIMPLE WEDDING! WHERE MY FIANCEE CAN GO TO THE BATHROOM ANYTIME HE WANTS! You know what? You're done.
What?
YOU'RE FIRED! Cheers!
Hey!
Happy wedding day!
Oh, happy my wedding day to you!
Ok-dokey, Joey, listen. This is gonna be bridesmaid central, all right? We're gonna have hair and make-up going on in the bathroom and oh, I had to move a couple of things in the fridge to make room for the corsages.
Oh, man! I wouldn't have had breakfast if I knew there was going to be corsages!
Hi. About last night... I know you are under a lot of stress and even though the things you said hurt me a little bit... My point is, uh, well, I'm willing to take my job back.
Oh, well that's ok. I think you and I will do much better if you're just... here as a bridesmaid.
Oh, is that so? Ok. If that's really what you want, then here... I give you the headset. Well, I don't really want to give you the headset. Well I guess if you're taking over, you should probably return these messages.
Wow, this is a lot!
Uh-huh, but I'm sure you can handle this. I mean, I have won awards for my organizational skills, but, uh, I'm sure you'll do fine.
You won awards?
Mm-mh. I printed them out on my computer.
Hey!
Hi.
Where's Rach?
She's in her room, why?
I have to talk to her about this groomsman situation, ok? I'm not gonna watch Chandler up there while I'm sitting in the seats like some chump! . Oh! My God! You're breathtaking!
What d'you want?
You haven't by any chance chosen a groomsman yet, have you?
Oh, Ross, c'mon, please! Don't make this harder than it already is!
I'm not! I'm making it easier! Pick me!
Well, Chandler said that it's really important to him too!
Listen, listen. Whoever you pick is gonna walk down the aisle with you! Now, I promise I won't say a word, but if you pick Chandler he's gonna be whispering stupid jokes in your ear the whole time!
Oh, you are the lesser of two evils!
YES, YES!
Sven I don't understand what you're saying! What is wrong with the flowers? Lorkins? What the hell are lorkins?
I know. .
Hey.
Listen, Mike, if you were Swedish and you were saying the word "lorkins" what flowers would that be?
Orchids?
Right there! That's why I'm marrying you!
Hello Michael.
Joseph.
May I have a word with you, please?
This is... great...
Have a seat. Last night, I tried to welcome you into my family... and instead, you disrespect me... I cannot allow this.
Are you rehearsing for some really bad mafia movie?
More back talk. And yes, I may be borrowing a few lines from my recent unsuccessful audition for "Family Honor 2: Thissa Time Itsa Personal."
Joey, I kinda have a lot to do today, what do you want?
I want you to take this seriously! Phoebe is very very important to me, ok? And I wanna make sure that you are gonna take care of her.
Joe, I love Phoebe. She's the single most important thing in my life. I'd die before I let anything happen to her.
That's what I wanted to hear! Because she's family, ok, and now you're gonna be family, and there is nothing more important in the whole world, than family.
That must have been one lousy movie.
That was ME!
Hi.
Hey, can I talk to you about this groomsman thing? If you pick Ross, he'll walk you down the isle just fine. But if you choose me, you'll be getting some comedy!
Even so, I think I'm gonna pick Ross.
Let me tell you why you need to pick me. See, when I was a kid, I was always left out of everything, you know, and it really made me feel... insecure. You know, I was always picked last in gym. Even behind that big fat exchange student who didn't even know the rules to baseball. I mean, this guy would strike out and then run to third. Anyway, If I'm the only one left out of this wedding, I just know that all those feelings are gonna come rushing back.
All right fine, I pick you.
Y-Y-YEEESSS! Make "groom" for Chandler.
Oh my...
No! We're gonna do it my way. Because your way is stupid! Alright I gotta go, I have another call, Reverend. Hello?
I'm glad we had this little talk.
Yes. Yeah and thanks for all the wedding night advice. That didn't make me uncomfortable at all! Alright, so I'll see everybody tonight?
Okay.
Bye.
Uhm, did you guys know that there is a giant ice sculpture in the hall?
Oh my God, what's it doing here?
Ugh, I guess it got sent to the billing address as opposed to the shipping address. Uh! What a pickle.
Oh my God, everything is such a mess. Why is this happening to me?
How bad do you want to stick your tongue on that?
How's it going?
Good. I'm just getting some coffee. So I'm alert for the wedding.
That's what I was doing too.
Well, you have fun tonight.
You too.
Oh, I will.
Me too.
Wait a minute, I know why I'm being such an ass, why are you?
I'm not supposed to tell you.
I'm not supposed to tell you!
You told us both we could be in the wedding?
Well, in my defense, you were not supposed to tell each other.
Rachel, only one of us can do it, you have to choose. You and me together again.
Rach, Rach, knock knock.
Who's there?
I'll tell you at the wedding.
Uh.
Hey, I forgot my scarf.
You know what, I can't do this. I don't know which one of you guys to pick.
Oh, you haven't picked yet. Oh good, 'cause I had an idea. I thought it would be fun if the third groomsman was my family dog. Chappy.
What? A dog? No! Rachel gets to choose.
Wow, this is a tough one. I think I'm gonna have to go with the dog.
Alright, wait, so what you're saying is that the chef is at the Hamilton Club, but the food is not and the drinks are there, but the bartender is not? Are you, are you FREAKING KIDDING ME!?
How's it going?
Help me.
What?
I want you to be Crazy Bitch again.
Really?
Please?
You really want me to come back?
More than I wanna get married.
Ok people, we are back in business! Oh God, we've missed you soo much! Ok, go and get your hair and make-up done, and I'll take care of everything.
Hey, what are you guys gonna do?
About what?
The blizzard. I just saw on the news, it's like the worst snow storm in 20 years! They already closed all the bridges and tunnels.
Ooh! But the band and the photographer are coming all the way in from New Jersey!
I don't think they are.
Haha! Looks like you're not going to be in the wedding either. So sorry Pheebs.
Well, the club lost it's power.
Yeah according to the news, most of the city did.
Since when do you watch the news?
Uh, for your information, since they hired a very hot weather girl.
I can't believe you guys aren't going to be able to get married today.
I know.
Wow, you know, it's so beautiful out there. You always wanted to get married outside. Why don't you guys just do it on the street?
What?
Well, look, it's hardly snowing anymore. I mean you couldn't ask for a more romantic setting. This could be the simple wedding you've always wanted!
What do you think?
I think I wanna get married to you today.
Me too! Monica, do you think we could do it?
AFFIRMATIVE!
OK LET'S GET THESE CHAIRS OUT HERE! Gunther, hit the Christmas lights. Okay, who left the ice sculpture ON THE STEAM GRATE?
Michael!
Hey! You made it. Great! Chappy! Hi! Hi! Mom, I know getting married in the street isn't something you approve of...
No... It's lovely. The lights and the snow. I could look at them forever.
I crushed a pill and put it in her drink... Come on, sweetheart.
You know, Chappy's too small to handle all this snow. Someone's gonna have to walk him down the aisle.
So technically, would this person be in the wedding?
I guess.
I'll do it!
No, but Chandler, hello... Aren't you scared of dogs?
I'm not scared. I'll just take little Chappy and... HE CAN SENSE MY FEAR. MY THROAT IS EXPOSED.
Well, I guess I'm in the wedding then. Ha haaa... He stinks!
Level 1 alert. I repeat, level 1. This is not a drill. Okay we've got a situation. The minister just called. He's snowed in. He can't make it.
Oh, no!
Oh hey, don't worry. I'm still ordained from your wedding.
Really?
Yeah, you'd think I'd give up being a minister and start paying to ride the subway? Huhuh...
Uhm, ministers don't ride the subway for free.
I had to read the Bible pretty carefully, but... yeah we do.
Okay, if Joey does the ceremony, then we have to find someone else to walk Phoebe down the isle.
I'll do it.
I'll...
Na ha ha... Ne he he... Ah ah...
Okay, Mike and Joey, get in position. Chandler, come with me.
Okay, Joey's doing the ceremony and Chandler's giving you away.
Oh, okay. Hi new dad.
So, you're ready to do this?
Uhuh, uhuh... Oh my God! This is really happening.
Oh Phoebe, I'm so happy for you honey.
Oh, thank you.
I love you. Oh, wait, wait, wait! No hugs. The dresses... Oh what the hell.
I love you guys.
I love you.
Okay. It's zero hour. All teams execute on my count. Let's get this bad boy on the road.
Is it okay that I want you to wear that head set in bed tonight?
I have you scheduled for nudity at 2300 hours.
Oh yeah!
Okay Marjorie, hit it.
Geez Ross, you could have showered.
It's the dog.
Groomsman, groomsman, why are you just standing there, where is your bridesmaid? We've got a broken arrow. Bridesmaid down! Oh, that's me.
Ready?
Okay.
Okay.
Oh wait, oh no. Wait.
Wow! Aren't you gonna be cold?
I don't care... I'll be my something blue.
You look beautiful.
Thank you.
My God! Aren't you freezing?
Na-ah.
Friends, family, dog... Thank you all for being here to witness this blessed event. The cold has now spread to my special place... so I'm gonna do the short version of this. Phoebe and Mike are perfect for each other. And I know I speak for every one here... when I wish them a lifetime of happiness. Who has the rings?
Okay...
When I was growing up, I didn't have a normal mom and dad, or a regular family like everybody else, and I always knew that something was missing. But now I'm standing here today, knowing that I have everything I'm ever gonna need... You are my family.
Phoebe you're so beautiful. You're so kind, you're so generous. You're so wonderfully weird. Every day with you is an adventure, and I can't believe how lucky I am, and I can't wait to share my life with you forever.
Oh wait, oh I forgot... and uhm... I love you... and you have nice eyes.
I love you too.
Uh Joey...
Yeah?
Chappy's heart rate has slowed way down.
Oh, okay. Phoebe, do you take this man to be your husband?
I do.
Mike, do you take this woman to be your wife?
I do.
I now pronounce you... husband and wife.
I got married! Could someone get me a coat, I'm freaking freezing.
That really was an incredible wedding.
It was, yeah. I kind of don't want it to end. Hey, you wanna come in for a drink and a bite of corsage?
I'd love to, but it's 2300 hours and I'm about to have the most organized sex anyone's ever had.
Nice. Oh hey, what about Ross?
I don't know. Maybe he hooked up with that hot girl he was talking to.
Come on Chappy, do your business. MAKE! MA-AKE! I did not sign on for this.
Hi.
Hey! Hi!
How was the honeymoon? Phoebe; Oh, incredible! Oh! Champagne, candle-lit dinners, moonlight walks on the beach, it was sooo ro-man-tic!
Oh!
So, where's Mike?
Oh, he's at the doctor, he didn't poop the whole time we were there!
Well anyway, I'm glad you're back, I really need your help.
Oh, why? What's up?
I have an audition for this play and for some of it I have to speak French. Which, according to my resume, I'm fluent in.
Joey, you shouldn't lie on your resume.
Yeah, you really shouldn't. By the way, how was that year-long dig in Cairo?
It was ok...
I did not know you spoke French.
Oui, bien sur je parle Francais! Qu'est-ce que tu penses alors?
Oh... you're so sexy!
Well, so, will you help me? I really wanna be in this play.
Sure! Tout le plaisir est pour moi, mon ami.
Seriously stop it, or I'm gonna jump on ya.
Hey.
Hey.
Why are you wearing my apron?
I'm making cookies for Erica. And oh, by the way, we have to leave for the airport soon, her plane comes in about an hour.
Oh, hey, when she gets here, is it ok if I introduce you two as "my wife" and "the woman who's carrying my child"? No? Divorce?
Hey.
Hey.
You guys know where Rachel is?
No, we haven't seen her since this morning.
So unbelievable. She was supposed to meet me half an hour ago with Emma.
Hey!
Hey!
These are for Erica!
What? She's gonna eat all those cookies?
Well, I want he baby to come out all cute and fat!
So, why is Erica coming to visit?
Well, because we want to get to know her better and she's never been to New York so she wants to see all the tourists' spots... you know, Statue of Liberty, Empire State Building...
Oh, those places! There's always so many people, their being corralled like cattle, and... you know, there's always some idiot who goes "Mooooo"!
Well, if it annoys you so much, then why do you do it?
Oh, hi! Hi! Thanks for showing you up thirty minutes late!
Ross...
No, no, no, I'm sure you have a great excuse, wh-was it a hair appointment, a mani-pedi or was there a sale at Barney's?
My father had an heart attack... ...while I was at Barney's.
Oh my God.
Honey.
I'm so sorry...
Is-is he ok?
Yeah, they said he's gonna be fine, but he's still heavily sedated.
Ok, ok. I'm gonna come out to Long Island with you, I mean, you can't be alone right now.
No, come on, I'm totally ok. I don't need you to come! I can totally handle this on my own.
Still-still, let me come... for me.
Ok. If you really need to.
I bet someone could use one of Monica's freshly baked cookies.
Oh, I really could.
Oh!
Ohh...
All right, it seems pretty simple. Your first line is "My name is Claude", so, just repeat after me. "Je m'appelle Claude".
Je de coup Clow.
Well, just... let's try it again.
Ok.
Je m'appelle Claude.
Je depli mblue.
Uh. It's not... quite what I'm saying.
Really? It sounds exactly the same to me.
It does, really?
Yeah.
All right, let just try it again. Really listen.
Got it.
Je m'appelle Claude.
Je te flouppe Fli.
Oh, mon Dieu!
Oh, de fuff!
Hey you guys.
Hi!
Hey.
I want you to meet someone really special. Phoebe, this is Erica. And this is the baby!
Oh!
Joey. Erica, baby!
Hi.
Everyone. Erica, baby!
Monica. Calm, self.
Thank you. It's really nice to meet you guys, I can't believe I'm here!
Welcome to New York City! Or should I say "ghe deu flooff New York City"?
Why would you say that?
Ok. What are you gonna be doing today?
I wanna see everything! Times Square, Coney Island, Rockefeller Center...
Oh, you know what you should do? You should walk all the way at the top of Statue of Liberty.
Oh yeah, let's do that!
Great! This baby'd better to be really good.
Oh, uhm, excuse me, I'm here to see my father. My name is Rachel Green.
And I'm Doctor Ross Geller.
Ross, please, this is a hospital, ok? That actually means something here.
Can somebody please go in?
Absolutely.
Rach, I think I'm gonna wait out here, because my throat is feeling a little scratchy, I don't want to infect him.
Ross, please, don't be so scared of him!
I'm not scared of him, I'm really sick!
He's under sedation, so he's pretty much out.
I'm feeling better.
Oh! Oh! Oh my God! Ohhh, ohhh, wow, that ear and nose hair trimmer I got him was just money down the drain, huh?
Miss Green, your father's doctor is on the phone if you'd like to speak to him.
Oh, great, Are you gonna be ok?
He's unconscious, I think we'll be just fine!
Ok.
Did the TV wake you?
No, when you put your feet up in my bed, you tugged on my catheter.
Ouchy.
What are you doing here, Geller?
Well, I came with Rachel, who should be back any second! So what's new?
Ooh, I have a little heart attack.
Right, is it painful?
What, the heart attack or sitting here talking to you? Ross Let's see if we can get that Rachel back here.
So what's new with you, uh, knocked up any more of my daughters lately?
Nope, just the one. RACH!
Je m'appelle Claude.
Je do call blue!
Noooo! Ok, maybe if we just break it down. Ok, let's try at one syllable at a time. Ok? So repeat after me. "je".
je.
m'ap.
mah.
pelle.
pel.
Great, ok faster! "je"
je.
m'ap.
mah.
pelle.
pel.
Je m'appelle!
Me pooh pooh!
Ok, it's too hard, I can't teach you!
What are you doing?
I, I have to go before I put your head through a wall.
Don't move! Don't go! I need you! My audition is tomorrow! Shah blue blah! Me lah peeh! Ombrah! . Pooh.
Hey!
Hi!
I was gonna make us some dinner but all I found in your dad's fridge was bacon and heavy cream. I think we solved the mystery of the heart attack.
Uh. Did you call your parents?
Oh, yeah. Emma's doing great.
Oh good.
Wow.
What?
Just can't believe I'm in Rachel Green's room.
What do you mean? You've been in my room before!
Yeah, sure, right! Like I've ever been in Rachel Green's room.
Ok I gotta tell ya, it's really weird when you use my whole name.
Sorry. . You ok?
Yeah.
You had a rough day, uh?
Yeah, just so weird seeing him like that, you know? I mean he is a doctor, you don't expect doctors to get sick!
But we do! It's gonna be ok, Rach!
Ow. I don't want him to wake up alone! I should go to the hospital!
What? No, no! Hey, hey, hey look...
What?
They gave him a lot of medication, ok? He wouldn't even know if you were there. Look, we'll go see him first thing in the morning, ok?
Really, I shouldn't feel guilty?
No, God! Hey, Rach, you've been an amazing daughter, ok? Right now you just need to get some rest.
Ok, maybe you're right.
Good night.
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Would you stay here with me for a little while?
Sure!
Ok. Thank you for coming with me today.
Oh, of course...
Rachel Green is very happy you're in her room!
Me too. Come here.
I just don't want to be alone tonight.
Ok, well, uh, I can maybe grab a sleeping bag, or... Oh, oh. . No, Rach! I'm sorry, I just don't think this, this, this is a good idea.
Wait, we won't know that until we do it, will we?
No, look, uh. You are upset about your father and you're feeling vulnerable and I just don't feel it would be right, I'd feel like I'd be, you know, taking advantage of you.
Taking advantage? I'm giving you the advantage, enjoy!
Look, I'm sure it would be great, but I-I think one of us has to be thinking clearly, so, I'm gonna go!
Wow. Ok.
I'll see you in the morning .
Mhm-mh!
Haven't had sex in four months, I should get a medal for that!
Thanks so much for taking me to all those places. I had a great time.
Oh, I'm glad. Listen, I want to apologize about Chandler, though. I just did not see this coming.
New York is awesome!
What is with you?
Yeah, I've been to these places before, but I've never really seen them, you know.
Yeah, you miss alot, when you're moo-ing.
Thanks so much for showing me around.
Oh! It was our pleasure. We are so much enjoying getting to know you.
Well, if there is anything else you wanna know...
Oh, uhm, okay, uhm, do you mind if we ask you some questions about the father?
Oh, sure. Yeah, well, he was my high school boyfriend. Captain of the football team, really cute and he got a scholarship and went off to college.
That's great.
Yeah... it's almost definitely him.
How's that now?
Well, there is a chance it's another guy. I mean, I have only ever been with two guys, but they sorta overlapped.
So, what does the other guy do? Does he go to college too?
No, he's in prison.
Was he falsely accused of something?
No... he killed his father with a shovel. But other than that, he's a great guy.
I'll bet his dad doesn't think so.
Are you awake?
Of course I'm awake. Assume from now on that I'm always awake!
Alright, we don't know that it's him. I mean, it could be the football guy.
Honey, it's us. Of course it's the shovel-killer.
Alright, lets say that it is him, would we not want the baby? No! Would we treat him any differently?
I'd keep an eye on him! We have to find out which one the father is.
How?
I dunno, aren't there tests for these things, right?
Yeah, but maybe we're just over-reacting.
Pff, easy for you to say, he's a father killer. He probably loves him mommy. He's probably got a tattoo that says "mom" on his shovel-wielding arm!
We will now count from one to five. Un, deux, trois, quatre, cinq.
Huh, un, blu, bla, flu, flenk!
Good job.
Thank you.
Hey Joey.
Hey!
Listen, I feel really badly about yesterday and I thought about it a lot and, and I know, I was too impatient. SO lets try it again.
Oh, no, that's okay, I don't need your help. I worked on it myself and I gotta say, I am pretty good!
Really, can I hear some of it.
Sure, sure. Ok, "Bleu de la bleu, de la blu bla bleu" See?
Well, you're not, You're not... you're not... again, you're not SPEAKING FRENCH!
Oh well I think I am, yeah and I think I'm definitely gonna get the part.
How could you possibly think that?
For one thing, the guy on the tape said I was doing a good job!
Hey Rach, can you grab me a cup of coffee?
Sure.
You've been quiet all morning. Is everything okay?
Hmm-hmm.
You sure you're alright?
Yep.
O-kay. Well, I'm gonna go grab us some breakfast.
FYI..
There it is...
In the future, when a girl asks for some ill-advised sympathy sex... just do it.
Wait, wait, You're mad at me about last night? I was just trying to do the right thing.
Really? Well, it seems to me if you'd done the right thing, I would not have woken up today feeling stupid and embarrassed, I would have woken up feeling comforted and satisfied!
Well...
Oh stop that!
I can't believe this. I was just being a good guy. I treated you with respect and understanding.
Oh, that is so hot. She walks around him to the other side)
Hey, I was looking out for you.
Oh, really, well Ross, you know what? I am a big girl. I don't need someone telling me what is best for me.
I gotta say, I have not had sex a lot of times before, this is the worst ever.
Oh, really, really? Well, it wasn't very good for me either.
Hey you know what? You know what? To avoid this little thing in the future, let's just say, you and me, never having sex again.
What?
That's right, sex is off the table. I am never having sex with you again. Dr. Green, are you feeling better?
Hey! How was lunch?
We had a good time. By the way, I wanted to ask you something. It would really mean a lot to me, if the baby was a boy, that you name him after my father, Jiminy Billy Bob.
Oh, really?
No! You we're right, that was fun! I'm gonna go finish packing.
O-okay. So, is she gonna take the test?
Nope, she doesn't have to, I found out who the father is.
Oh God. It's shovely-Joe, isn't it?
No it's not.
How do you know?
Well, it turns out that Erica didn't pay much attention in Sex Ed class, because the thing she did with that prison guy... it'd be pretty hard to make a baby that way.
Oh God! What was it? The thing that we hardly ever do or the thing we never do?
The thing we never do.
Shovely Joe!
Whenever you're ready Joey.
Right. Dja bu bu Claude. Uh, c'est la pu les la lu blah bloo.
I'm sorry, what's going on?
Dude, come on! French it u-up!
Joey, do you speak French?
Toutes la smore! Bu blu-ay bloo blah ooh! Pfoof!
You know what. I think this audition is over.
Uh, excuse me. Uh, I am Regine Philange. I was passing by when I heard this man speaking the regional dialect of my French town of Estee Lauder.
You really think this man is speaking French?
Sa-sa-saw!
Ecoutez, je vais vous dire la verite. C'est mon petit frere. Il est un peu retarde.
Alors, si vous pouviez jouer le jeu avec lui...
Good job, little buddy. That was some really good French. But I think we're gonna go with someone else for the part.
Ah. All right. But my French was good?
It was great.
Oh-hoh! Ha-hah! See!
Merci. Au revoir.
Yeah-hah. Toute-de-le-fruit.
Emma's down for the night.
Oh, good.
So uh... I guess I wanna take off.
Okay... Hey listen, just before you go I-I again, I just wanna say "thank you" for coming with me.
Oh, no problem.
And also, you know I uh, I was thinking about what you said, you know, about the whole sex thing and... it's probably not a great idea to go down that road again.
Thank you. I'm glad you agree.
It's a shame though, I mean, when we did it, it was pretty good.
Yeah... Yeah, that's true.
Hey uhm, do you remember that one really great time...?
Oh, ye-ah!
You know it was you're uhm... birthday...
...Valentine's day...
Oh yeah!
Well, I guess that's all in the past, now.
Hmmm-mmmm.
Not even one more time?
Not even once.
No matter how much we want it.
Even if we want it really bad.
That's what we decided.
Uhm, right!
...It's kinda hard though!
Yeah.
You know, when two people have a connection, you know, that's... just seems like such a... waste.
...I hate waste.
...Ross?
Yes?
Just so you know... With us... it's never off the table.
Damn it. It's never off the table.
Okay, can you really tapdance?
No.
It's off the resume.
Archery?
No.
Horseback riding?
Would fall off a lot.
You can drink a gallon of milk in 10 seconds?
That I can do.
Come on! You can drink a gallon of milk in 10 seconds?
All right, watch me! Okay, you time me. Ready?
Ready... GO!
You did it!
Thank you guys for having us over.
Oh! Yeah, this is fun, couples night.
Yeah, I don't know why we hang out with married couples more often.
Well, because every time we do, you make jokes about swinging and scare them away.
You mean that Portuguese couple? Yeah, like you wouldn't have done it.
Hey, you guys... I have great news.
Ross, we're kind of in the middle of diner here.
Oh, well, er, I already ate, but sure...! Guess what happened at work today...
A dinosaur died a million years ago?
Try sixty-five million years ago, and then try sssshhhhhh.... My tenure review board met today and I hear it's looking really good.
Wow!
Yeah. Do you have any idea what this means in academic circles, uh? I am gonna get laid.
Hi you guys.
Hey.
Ooh, Italian!
No one wanted seconds, right?
No, no. I-I'm good.
Hey you guys... You're never gonna believe it. This headhunter called me. I have a meeting tomorrow with Gucci. Gucci wants me.
I'm up for tenure.
Congratulations!
You too! What are the odds?
Ooh!
Guess what? I finally got that seed out of my teeth.
I don't know who I'm happiest for...
I do, he's been working on that all day!
Hey Mon? Was it weird changing your name to Geller-Bing?
No, no. It felt nice to acknowledge this.
Where did you go to do it?
Uhm the... the ministry... of names... bureau...
YOU NEVER DID IT!
I'm sorry. It's just the idea of being an official Bing.
Hey! I will have you know that... aah, who am I kidding. Let's call the kid Geller and let Bing die with me.
Here you go.
Thanks! Honey, would you want me to take your name?
Oh, it's just... It's up to you. It's your name. You've got to live with it.
All right, let's see, call me mrs Hannigan.
Mrs Hannigan?
What? Can't you see I'm in the middle of something? Ooh, I like it.
Hey guys.
Hey Joe! We've got a couple of things we've got to check out at the new house. You want to come with us?
No, thank you.
All right. I know you're not happy about us moving, but you're the only one who hasn't seen the house.
Yeah, come with us. You'll see how close it is to the city.
But no, it's not close. You said it was in escrow? I couldn't even find it on the map.
Joey, please come. It would mean so much to us.
You know what? You are my friends, I wanna be supportive, I will come with you. SHOTGUN!
Damn it.
See you guys later.
Okay!
I'll pick you up at eleven. So glad you're coming.
Good for you. That was really mature.
What? No, the only reason I'm going to their stupid new house, is so I can point out everything that's wrong with it, so they don't move. I'm gonna make them stay here.
You're a strange kind of grown-up.
Joey, you can't make someone do something they don't want to do. Believe me, there's something I've been trying to get Mike to do in bed and there's... he's just...
Woo-wo-hey-hey-hey... Can we not talk about that right now?
All right, prude... Look, Monica and Chandler really love this house. You are not gonna talk them into staying here.
Hey, hey... I can convince people to do anything, you know. I bet I can even get Mike to do that "thing". What is it?
I AM NOT GONNA HELP YOU DO THAT! Goodbye!
Hi, I'm here to see mr Campbell... with Gucci. The reservation is probably under Gucci. It's spelled like Gukki, which could be confusing.
Mr Campbell's not here yet. Let me show you to his table.
Oh my God! That's my boss. You have to seat us somewhere else.
I'm sorry. That's always mr Campbell's table.
But my... but my boss cannot see me. I'm interviewing for another job.
I know. With Gukki.
Sssshhhh!
Rachel?
Hi... I'm on a date...
That's great!
Yeah, it is. Yeah, you know, it's tough. Single mom, career... You gotta get out there.
Well, you got uhm... good energy.
Oh.
Rachel?
Yes, hi!
James Campbell...
Hi! Excuse us.
Please...
Okay. Oh, yeah... Oh he's cute!
So... your resume is quite impressive.
Wha... My resume? I wouldn't... I wouldn't call my online dating profile a resume.
Dating profile? I-I-I'm talking about the work resume.
Whatever happened to just singing for no reason? Huh?
Maybe people... found it weird.... So, why do you want to leave Ralph Lauren?
What? I-I don't.
You don't?
No, I-I-I love it there.
Well, if you don't want to leave, why are we having this lunch?
What?
That's Hugo Boss?
This place is so depressing. If I had to work here I'd kill myself. But you obviously haven't.
How can I help you?
I need to change my name, please. See, I need to change it because I'm-I'm hiding from the law. You're fun.
You need to fill out this form.
Okay, well, I just don't, I don't know how it works exactly. See, my name is Buffay and my husband's name is Hannigan, so is it supposed to be Buffay-Hannigan or Hannigan-Buffay?
It can be anything you want.
Well, not anything, I mean...
Yeah... anything.
Oh, this could take a while.
Get out of my line.
Okay.
Hey!
Hey Pheebs.
Oh, not anymore. I changed it today.
Oh, I'm sorry, mrs Hannigan.
Wrong again! Apparently you can change it to anything you want. So I thought, all right, here's an opportunity to be creative. So meet Princess Consuela Banana Hammock.
That's what we were gonna name the baby.
Phoebe!
Uh! Princess Consuela.
You seriously changed your name to that?
Uh-huh!
Okay, so from now on we have to call you Princess Consuela?
Uhm, no. I'm gonna have my friends call me Valerie.
Hey, how'd the interview go?
Oh! It's not good.
You know, I always feel that way after an interview. I'll bet it went better than you think.
Well, I didn't get the job at Gucci and I got fired from Ralph Lauren.
That is a bad interview.
What are you, what are you talking about? How did this happen?
Well, my boss was at the same restaurant where I was having my interview and he heard everything. So later he calls me to his office and he tells me that he's gonna have to let me go, because I'm not a team player. And I said "Wait a minute! Yes I am." and I had to sit there for 45 minutes while he proved that that in fact... was true.
Oh God. I'm so sorry.
Hey! Wha-hoo! What's this? Well it's a, it's a bottle of champagne. Why is this here?
Ross...
I guess it's here because I GOT TENURE!
Congratulations!
This is the single greatest day of my professional career. Gunther, six glasses!
Six? You want me to join you?
Oh, I thought Joey was here. Five is good. Well, I'm gonna have a loogie in my coffee tomorrow.
Ooh! Israeli champagne. And it's vanilla!
I got tenure. I didn't win the lottery... Hey Rach, so uh... how did your thing go?
Oh it... good! Yeah, but I'm not gonna hear from that for a couple of days.
Oh, you know what? You're gonna get it. I-I-I-I can feel it.
Can you?
Ah, all right. Here's to Ross!
And-and to years of hard work finally paying off.
And to knowing that your career doesn't mean everything.
But also knowing it means a lot.
But more importantly to full well-rounded lives.
...that center around work.
To Ross!
Ross!
You know what the best part about this is? I can never be fired.
Oh God!
No seriously. I have job security for life. You know, I never have to worry. Oh, look at you. Look how happy you are for me.
No, it's not that. I got fired today. And I didn't get the other job.
Rach, I'm so sorry.
Oh!
Great. I feel like an idiot.
No, it's okay, you didn't know.
Oh... Little heads-up would have been nice.
Thank you for letting us see the house again.
And thank you for explaining to us what escrow means... I've already forgotten what you said, but thank you.
Take as long as you want. Just let me know when you're through.
Ah, so glad you decided to come.
Me too. Yeah, this place is great. I'm so happy for you guys. Although, you know, I hope you like fungus.
What?
Fungus! Yeah. Place is full of it.
No it's not. We had an inspection and they didn't find anything.
Okay. Then I guess I have dry eyes and a scratchy throat for no reason.
Maybe because it's you hung your head out of the window like a dog the whole ride here.
Maybe. So this is the living room huh? Ooh, it's pretty dark.
No it's not!
Are you kiddin'? I think I just saw a bat in the corner!
When your head was hanging out the window, it didn't hit a mailbox, did it?
Maybe. Well, I just think you guys can do better than this house, you know? Or any other house for that matter.
Oh Joey, look, we know you're having a hard time with this, but we really, we love it here.
FINE, ok, if you love this house so much, then you should just live here, okay? I just hope you get used to that weird humming sound. Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm...
Joey, we know that's you.
no... hmmmmm... it's not... hmmmmmmmmmm.
Hey.
Welcome back!
Ah! I missed you.
Oh, me too!
So, what's new?
Well, I'm no longer Phoebe Buffay.
That's great! You changed you name?
Yes I did! Meet: Princess Consuela Banana Hammock!
You're kidding right?
Nope.
You really did that?
Yep.
Yeah, but you can't do that.
Why? It's fun, it's different, no-one else has a name like it.
Alright, then I'm gonna change my name.
Great, okay, what are you gonna change it to?
Crap Bag.
Mike Crap Bag?
No, no Mike, just Crap Bag. First name Crap, last name Bag.
You're not serious, right?
Yeah, I'm serious. It's fun, it's different and no-one else has a name like that!
Uhu, uhu, well, then, great. If you love it, I love it.
I do love it, and I love your name. I love Princess Consuela.
And I love Crap.
Ow!
Who are you?
Oh, hi, I'm Joey. My stupid friends are buying this house. Who are you?
I'm Mackenzie. My stupid parents are selling this house.
Oh.
I hate my parents.
I hate my friends. Alright, look. There's gotta be a way that we can stop this from happening.
Like what?
Uhm... oh! Okay. You come with me, and you tell them that the house is haunted!
What are you? Eight?
Woah, uh! Okay, let's hear your great idea.
I don't have any great ideas. I am eight.
Ahh! There's gotta be a way. I mean, you know, if Monica and Chandler move out here and now Phoebe is married to Mike. That just leaves me and Ross and Rach, you know what I mean?
I really don't.
What am I gonna do, I feel like I'm losing my friends.
My parents say I'm gonna make new friends.
Oh, yeah, sure, easy for you, you're young. Me, I'm set in my ways.
This is what my mom was talking about. Whiners are wieners. Look, you want your friends to be happy, right?
Yeah, yeah, I guess.
Well, if moving here is gonna make them happy, don't you want them to do it?
Yeah, maybe.
Then you gotta let them go.
I hate to admit it, but you're probably right. How did you get to be so smart?
I read a lot.
Just when I thought we could be friends.
Hey Rach, I just heard. I'm so sorry.
Oh, thank you...
You still don't know my name, do you?
Well, now I don't have to.
Ross, what is taking you so long?
I'm sorry, it's almost as if this wasn't built for a quick getaway!
Rachel?
Mark? Oh my God!
How've you been?
I'm fantastic. You remember Ross?
Sure, sure. What's with the chair.
Uh, you know, you can't always get a seat on the subway, so...
Clever. So how are you?
Oh, well, you're not catching me on my best day.
Yeah, a box full of your desk stuff doesn't exactly say big promotion.
No, but it's good, you know, I'm gonna take some time off and do some charity work.
Are you sure, because we may have something at Louis Vuitton.
Well, screw charity work. What've you got?
Why don't we have dinner tonight and talk about it?
Great! I'll call ya!
Nice to see you.
Yeah! yeah, I got tenure!
Oh my God!
See? I told you something good would come along. And he seemed really nice. I've met him before?
Ross! That's Mark. From Bloomingdales? You were insanely jealous of him.
That is Mark?
Yes.
I hate that guy.
Oh.
No, no, NO, you cannot go to dinner with him.
What? You don't want me to get a job?
Oh yeah, I'm sure he's gonna give you a job. Maybe make you his SEXretary.
Ugh.
I'm serious. I just don't trust that guy, okay?
Ross, you know what? Okay, let's talk about it later, there comes security.
Oh, I love this street. The trees, the big front yards, the actual picket fences.
Man, those two dogs are going at it!
Hey!
Hey.
Hey, where have you been?
Oh, just er... you know, looking around. But you know what? This house... is great.
Really? What changed your mind?
Oh well, the little girl who lives here made me feel a lot better about the whole thing.
Joey, there was a little girl who lived here, but she died like 30 years ago.
What?
Ha! I'm just messing with you.
That's not funny! You know I'm afraid of little girl ghosts!
Joey, now that you're okay with the house, do you wanna go see your room?
What? I get my own room?
You don't think we'd buy a house and not have a Joey room do you?
Oh my God! Oh! Hey, can I have an aquarium? And a sex swing?
No!
Why not? I'll keep the tank clean.
After you, miss Banana Hammock.
Thank you, mister Bag.
Oh hey, how are you?
Oh hi Rita! Good! Oh, Rita's a massage client.
Oh! Why don't you introduce me?
Er, Rita, this is my husband.
Oh!
Yeah.
Why don't you tell her my name?
Okay, I will. This is my husband Crap Bag.
Crap Bag?
If you need an easy way to remember it, just think of a bag of crap.
Okay. Excuse me...
Yeah... Ogh... Okay, fine. You made your point. Can you please just be Mike Hannigan again?
Only if you'll be Phoebe Buffay.
How about uhm... How about Buffay-Hannigan?
Really?
Yeah. I'm Phoebe Buffay-Hannigan Banana Hammock.
Do you even know what a banana hammock is?
It's a funny word.
It's a Speedo.
...Oh crap!
Hey, is Rachel here?
No.
She's still at dinner?
I guess. Why? Who's she with?
That guy Mark. From Bloomingdale's... She thinks he's just being nice to her. But I know he really wants to sleep with her.
It's seven years ago. My time machine works!
We ran into him on the street today and he said he might have a job for her. But I know he just wants to get into her pants.
So what if he wants to sleep with her? I mean, she's single and he's cute.
Excuse me?
Oh please! Yesterday on the subway? You couldn't stop staring at that woman with the big breasts the whole time.
For your information, I was staring at her baby. We're about to be parents.
Oh, sorry!
Hi you guys!
Hey, so uhm... How was dinner?
Oh, it was great. Mark is so sweet.
Oh yeah? Yeah? I wonder why? What could that smarmy letch possibly want?
Oh Ross, come on. He's happily married. His wife just had twins.
Should we send something?
How did the job stuff go?
He offered me one.
That's great!
Congratulations!
I know, it's amazing. It's amazing. It's so much better than what I had at Ralph Lauren. The money is great...
Can we, can we just stop for a second? Who said something better would come along, huh? You didn't believe me. I told you everything was gonna work out. You know what? This calls for a bottle of Israels finest.
The job is in Paris.
I mean, this soap opera is a great gig, but... am I missing opportunities? You know, I've always thought of myself as a serious actor. I mean, should I be trying to do more independent movies?
I don't know... You know what? I'm gonna put you on with my bear. Hold on.
Hey bear, I need some career advice.
How did the job stuff go?
He offered me one.
You know what? This calls for a bottle of Israels finest.
The job is in Paris. FADE OUT.
Oh, God! Please, somebody say something.
So if you take this job you'll be moving to Paris?
Or facing a bitch of a commute.
I know, it's huge, and it's scary, and it's... really far, far away from you guys, but this is such an incredible opportunity for me. And I've already talked to them about our situation with Emma, and they said they'll do whatever we need to make us feel comfortable.
Okay.
I mean, I'll fly back and forth, they'll fly you out... Anything we want.
My boss said I might be getting a new lamp in my cubicle.
All right, we'll work it out.
Thank you! Thank you!
Yeah, yeah! You sure this is what you want?
I think it is.
Ooh, what's going on?
I got a really incredible job offer.
Hey, great! All right!
Good for you!
It's in Paris.
What? No, no, no! No, no... no... no, no... No, too much is changing, okay? First, Phoebe getting married Congratulations! ... and then these two move into a stupid house in the stupid suburbs...
Hey, this afternoon you said you'd be supportive...
Well, it comes and goes. I wouldn't trust it.
Look, you guys... this is really, really important to me. And it means a lot if you could try to get on board.
Of course we can. Congratulations. Yay! Joey...
No, no, no. My hugs are reserved for people STAYING IN AMERICA.
Joey, it would mean so...
Hey! No! Get your France-going-arms away from me.
Joey...
You okay with this?
Well, it makes me feel sad, but...
Talking to Ross.
I see.
Well, Rachel moving to another country? Not being able to see her every day. How can I be okay with this?
I know, but what are we gonna do? She really needs this job.
Do you think if the Ralph Lauren people offered her her old job back, she would take it?
How is that gonna happen?
Is this the best way to use one of your three magic wishes?
I don't know. I could talk to her boss. Yeah! I met him at that Christmas party. We really hit it off.
You mean the guy who kept calling you Ron?
I didn't say we were brothers.
Hey Phoebe. Hey, tell me what you think. All right. The house next door to the one that we're buying in Westchester? Just went on the market. I wanna take a look at it, but Chandler doesn't.
We close escrow tomorrow, so seeing another house can only confuse us, and we're easily confused. We're not very bright.
But what if it is better than ours? Should we at least look?
What do you think Pheebs?
Well, I think that shirt makes you look like you should work at a Baskin Robbins... Anyway... Hey, isn't Joey's agent Estelle Leonard?
Yeah.
She died.
You're kidding!
That's terrible!
Yeah, last Saturday. Wow! She was the first black man to fly solo across the Atlantic. Oh, wait a minute, I read the wrong one.
Oh yeah?
Yeah, she was just an agent.
Joey's gonna be *so* upset.
I know. *He* always wanted to be the first black man to cross the Atlantic.
Well, we cannot tell Joey about this. He's already flipping out about everything that's changing. This will push him over the edge.
Seriously, you don't think we should tell him?
Well, not for a little while. Let's just give him a few days to get used to everything else.
What if he reads it in the paper?
Unless Snoopy says it to Charlie Brown, I think we're okay.
May I help you?
Yeah, I'm a friend of Rachel Green's. Uhm, actually we met at the Christmas party about two years ago.
Oh right, uhm, Don?
Close. Ron.
Uh... What can I do for you?
Uhm, well... I'm here to see if you'll give Rachel her job back.
Ah, did she ask you to come here and do this?
Oh, no. At first I have to get you to agree. Then we'll see if she wants to come back.
Wow, that is tempting.
Look, she loved her job here. And let's face it: you're not gonna find anyone who did it as well as she did it. Isn't that true?
She is good!
Huh, I took a shot there.
But I'm sorry. There's nothing I can do... Ah, it's not true, there is... nothing I want to do.
I see... Thanks very much. Is this your son?
Yeah, his name is Ross. What?
Oh, nothing, it's just, it's close to Ron. Does he.. Does little Ross like dinosaurs by any chance?
Yeah, they're all he talks about, why?
How would he like to come with me to the Museum of Natural History after everyone else has left, just the two of us, and he can touch anything he wants. . I just heard it as you must have heard it and that's not good. Let me start again. I'm a paleontologist, you'll be there with us and the touching refers only to bones... fossils!
You can really arrange that?
You let Rachel come back, and it's done.
Well, I guess having Rachel back wouldn't be the worst thing in the world.
Yeah! Yes! Thank you! This is great. Thank you so much. And I swear, your kid is going to have the time of his life.
That's great. I worry about little Ross. He's always reading, he's collecting rocks and he's obsessed with dinosaurs.
He'll be fine.
Hey Phoebe.
Hey. Everything ok?
I'm just mad at my agent.
Estelle? Why?
There's a part in a TV movie that I would be perfect for and I didn't even be put up for it! She'd better have a good reason.
I'm guessing she does.
Well I'm wanna hear it, because she keeps doing this.
Well, no, no, wait, wait, wait. All right, I gotta go. Just listen. Promise me, that you will wait a minute before you call her.
Ok. Why?
Because a promise between friends means never having to give a reason.
I love that saying! .
Hello?
Joey, it's Estelle.
I was just gonna call you! That's weird.
It's a little coincidental, but believable. . Listen, I'm sure you're wondering why I didn't get you an audition for that TV movie.
Yeah, actually I am!
I guess I dropped the ball there. Whoopsie!
That's it? You know, it seems all you do lately is drop the ball.
Don't take that tone with me. Who you think you are? Alan Lemond, the first black man to fly solo across the Atlantic?
No, no, look. All I'm saying is that you're my agent, ok? And you're not getting me into any auditions and I'm tired of it.
What are you saying?
I'm saying that... . This isn't working for me anymore, ok? Estelle, you're fired. Goodbye. .
Man, tough week for Estelle!
Hi.
Hi.
Emma left her stuffed t-rex at my house. You know she can't sleep without it.
Oh, well, she's asleep now. Stop forcing that thing on her.
Ok.
Oh, you're not gonna believe what happened to me today! Ralph Lauren called, and gave me my job back!
Nooo!
Yee. I mean, it was so weirdest thing. They fired me and then out of nowhere they just hire me back! I mean, that place must have been falling apart without me.
So, you're not going to Paris.
No, I'm still going.
Wh... wh...what?
When the Louis Vuitton people found out that Ralph Lauren wanted me back, the offered me more money! Isn't that great?
Yeeeah!
Hi. We're buying the house next door, and we were wondering if we could just take a look around.
Oh, sure. I'm showing it to someone else right now, but please, look around.
Thanks.
It feels like we're cheating on our house. And if we're gonna cheat, shouldn't it be with like a hot, younger house, that does stuff that our house won't do?
Ours is so much better! This living room is smaller, the dining room looks like a cave! What a hole!
So? What do you think?
Love it!
Well, we already have one offer on it, and I think the lady upstairs is goning to make another one.
They could be our neighbors, what are they like?
Oh, the woman upstairs is very nice. She and her husband have two kids, he's on Wall Street and she...
Oh my God! .
Sure.
Hey Joey, want come with me to... are you ok?
Yeah, I just... I just feel bad about firing Estelle. This is got to be killing her.
No, that wouldn't kill her. Ordinary embolism might.
I don't know. She's got to be taking it hard, I was like her only client. Except for this guy who eats paper. And I'm guessing he eats more money than he makes. Look, I know she's not a great agent, but she did stick with me for ten years. I'm gonna call her and hire her again.
No, no, no! Don't call her! You wait for her to call you.
Why?
Because patience is the road to understanding which ... is the key... to a happy heart.
You blow me away.
All right, so promise you're gonna wait for her to call you?
I promise. And that means, never having to give a reason.
What a small world!
And yet I never run into Beyonce!
You two know each other?
Oh, we go way back. Before Monica made an honest man out of him, Chandler used to be my little love muffin! . So? Are you guys thinking of getting this house too? Ooh! Are we gonna have a bidding war? I'd better warn you, I'm a toughie.
Don't, don't!
No, actually, we're buying the house next door.
Why!?
I don't know why.
Ooh, that decides it then. I was on the fence. But knowing that you two would be our neighbors? Ah! now we have to get it! Ellen, we're going to talk numbers.
This can not be happening!
Okay, the realtor said another couple made an offer. Maybe the Janice's won't get it! Maybe the other couple will.
The only way that that is going to happen, is if the other couple are the Hitlers.
Okay, Okay, All right. What if we got both houses? Huh? We can turn this house into a guest house.
That is a great idea! And by the way, I don't mean to sound distasteful, but when did you start crapping money!?
Okay, you come up with an idea.
Alright alright, we still have three hours till escrow closes on our house. We can still get out.
But we love our house.
Will we love it so much with her next door? And she's gonna be louder out here too. Just the crickets and "Oh My God"!
Okay, but if we don't get this house, she's stil gonna show up wherever we go! I mean, at least if she's here, it eliminates the element of suprise. I mean, never again will you have to hear the three words that make your balls jump back up inside your body.
Well, we have to do something. We can't have her living next door. Oh, that does it too.
Who is it?
It's me. Ron. Look, I um, I now Rachel turned you down but I think there is a way you might be able to get her to come back.
This may surprise you, but re-hiring fired employees, is not my main job.
Just hear me out. How would you feel about offering her a raise?
Not good, Ron.
Perhaps I can persuade you. What if you can give your son this genuine pterodactyl egg replica.
Wow, that's pretty cool.
Huh? So? We have a deal?
Okay, you got it.
Yes! yes!
This is gonna make me very popular.
Oh, Believe me, the ladies, they love it!
I meant with my son.
Good, 'cause the ladies, not so much.
Joey, this is Al T. Booker, the guy who eats paper. I'm sure you've heard that Estelle passed away. I wanted to let you know there's a memorial for her at the Westside chapel, tomorrow at ten. Hope you can make it.
Oh my God. Hello?
Joey, it's Estelle.
Estelle?
Yeah, I wanted to call and tell you that there's no hard feelings for firing me.
Ok-ay. I just, I can't believe you're calling me?
Well, I didn't think I should just drop by...
No, no, no! Don't drop by, don't drop by!
Anyway, you did what you had to do. I'm okay.
Can I ask you something? Uhm, what's it like there?
It's alright. Look kiddo, I gotta go. Good luck with the career. You're gonna be huge.
Thanks for everything Estelle. Bye. "out of area". Boy, I'll say.
Well... I just talked to Sid, we are definitely putting in an offer on the house... a-a-and I'll bet we get it.
The Hitlers will be so disappointed.
All right, I got to run. Tell Monica I say goodbye. And... I'll see you later, neighbor.
Wait! I just want you to know that... I'm so happy you're going to be here.
Oh, me too...
Because... that way... we can pick up where we left off.
Huh?
I never stopped loving you.
Oh... my...
Yeah, yeah, yeah! I want you... I need you... I must have you Janice Litman Goralnik Neihosenstein.
Chandler, what are you talking about?
Now that you live next door, we can be together every day. Sid and Monica never have to know a thing.
I don't know what to say... I mean, you know, obviously we have this... heat between us.
Obviously.
But I love my husband. And I know you love your wife. Now, I don't think we should get this house now.
Don't say that. Don't tangle the dream and take it away.
Chandler, one of us has got to be strong.
I understand.
Although, maybe just... one last moment of weakness... Goodbye Chandler Bing.
They're never coming down now.
Hi!
Hey!
You are never going to believe what happened to me today.
What?
Ralph Lauren called again and they offered me more money.
They did?
Yeah. It was the weirdest thing. Zelner called me and he said we'll do everything we can to get you back. And that I should thank some Ron... I don't even know what department that guy's in.
So, what are you gonna do?
Well, I took it.
That's great! So you're staying in New York!
YAY! WHOO! YAY!
You're excited, right?
Ye-ah. Yeah! You know, the money's great. It's certainly the easier choice...
Right!
Yeah, you know, was I looking forward to going to Paris? Sure. You know, was I excited about working in the fashion capital of the world? Ooh, absolutely... Oh...! Yeah, but you know, this is... it's fine. I'm fine going back to a job where I've pretty much gotten everything out of that I possibly can...
Uhm, I hadn't no you... I had no idea you were so excited about Paris. Uhm, I mean, you said you were scared.
Well yeah, but I mean, it was good scared though, you know? Like when I-moved-to-New-York scared. Or uhm, when I-found-out-I-was-gonna-have-Emma scared... But this is... fine. This is gonna be good.
You should go.
What?
It's what you want. You should go.
You really think so?
I really do.
But I already told Zelner that I would come back...
I'm sure he'll understand.
All right. ALL RIGHT! I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna go to Paris.
Yeah...
Yeah! I'm going to Paris. Thank you, Ross!
Yeah, yeah, oh!
Oh! Oh, I'm so happy.
Then I'm happy too.
Thank you all for coming. We're here today to pay respects to a wonderful agent and a beautiful woman... ..inside. As Estelle's only two clients we would like to say a few words. Dude, where's my speech? That is entertaining. Al Zebooker everybody.
All right, all right, all right, let's play one more time, ok? And remember, if I win you do not move to Paris.
Ok! Can't believe I'm risking this again, but you're on! All right Joe, you remember the rules! Heads I win, tails you lose.
Just flip!
Ha, tails!
Damnit!
Hey!
Hey!
So we thought we'd throw you little going away party around seven.
Oh, that sounds good!
Hey, Rach, you're leaving tomorrow, shouldn't you be packing?
It's all done!
Oh, yeah, right! And after I took a shower this morning I just threw my towel on the floor! Oh God, it hurts to even joke about it.
I know... Honey, seriously, I did it all. The luggage that I'm taking is in the bedroom, this is Emma's Paris stuff, these are the boxes that I'm having shipped, and that's the sandwich that I made for the plane...
Ok, so you've done some good work! What about your carry-ons?
Oh, well. Everything that I need is in here and my travel documents are on the counter organized in the order that I will be needing them.
Oh my God! I have nothing left to teach you!
Where's your passport?
It should be right next to my plane ticket.
Well, it's not.
What? Maybe I put it in here . Oh, oh, it's not in there! Oh, no! I must have packed it in one of these boxes!
Here, let me help you.
Shoot. Oh, I can't believe I did this!
At what point did it stop being funny that I took her passport? OPENING SEQUENCE.
Oh, wow, can you believe you're like three weeks away?
I know.
You don't mind me touching your belly, do you?
No, I don't mind you touching my belly, but right now your hand is kind of blocking the part where the baby is gonna come out.
Hey!
Hi.
Hey Erica, welcome back to town! Wow, look how big you've gotten.
That's because I'm pregnant!
Right, no, I understand.
Oh, ok. I'm just always afraid that people think I'm just fat with big breasts.
No, no, I knew .
Okay, well, stop staring at them.
She brought them up! I didn't realize you were coming back so soon!
Hey, well, in a couple of weeks I won't be able to travel.
Yeah, and I wanted her to get to know the doctors and get settled into the hotel.
Hotel? Why isn't she staying with you guys?
Because we're moving in a couple of days and it just didn't make sense.
Plus hotels are fun! My room has this little fridge full of free snacks!
Erica, those things aren't free. In fact they have one of the highest mark-ups of any consumer product...
Ross! She's giving us her baby. She can eat you if she wants.
I'll be right back.
Oh man, I can't believe you guys are leaving this place.
Oh, I know. I know. Hey, you know, you can take it if you want! The lease is still in Nana's name.
No, no. This will always be your place. It would be too sad. Plus, how much a month does it cost to feed Joey?
Yeah, it takes two incomes.
Hey, is Chandler here? We talked about catching a movie.
Oh, no. He doesn't have time for that. But if you want, you can go help him and Joey pack up the guest room.
Mhm, packing - sexy cheerleader comedy.
Mhm, helpful brother - creepy loner at teen movie.
What are you guys doing?
Try it, I can't feel a thing!
Are, are you kidding? This is packing?
We're taking a break!
From?
Jumping on the bed?
All right, Rachel's party is in a couple of hours and there's a lot to do. Now, Ross, you got Geller blood, you're in charge of these yahoos!
You got it! . All right, she's right, we gotta get serious. Let's put styrofoam peanuts down his pants and kick him!
No, no, no, guys. She's right. We should get to work. I'll take stuff out of the closet, Joey you pack 'em and Ross you re-pack whatever Joey packs.
You guys hear a ringing?
What the hell is this?
Hey! Handcuffs! And fur line, nice! I didn't know you guys had it in ya!
Chandler, you don't have a sister so you can't understand how much this bums me out.
I didn't know Monica had these!
Mhm, maybe she used them with another boyfriend. Maybe Richard!
Why would she use them with Richard and not me? I can be kinky! I once did a naked dance for her... with scarves!
Bumming hard, guys, bumming hard.
Hey!
Hey! Where's Mike?
Oh, he has a gig. I kinda like being married to a rock star, you know. My husband has a gig.
Yeah? Yeah, where is it?
Oh, he's playing organ for a children's roller-skating party.
Rock on! Phoebe : Wow, this is quite a spread! What is all this stuff?
Well, I thought this would be a great opportunity to use up all the food that I don't want to move to the new house with me! So, enjoy: smoke oyster casserole with a breakfast cereal crust, kidney beans in their own juices, and for dessert, a questionable orange.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey, where's Rach?
Oh, she's putting Emma down, she'll be over in a second.
Great.
Now it just hit her that she's leaving and she's kind of emotional so no one say anything to set her off, ok?
Yeah.
Hey Rach, hey you.
Here she is!
Hi you guys!
What did I just say?
No, no, no. It's ok. I'm gonna be fine.
Come here, I'll make you a drink.
Oh, man! I can't believe she's actually leaving. How am I gonna say goodbye to Rachel?
I know, she's been such a big part of my life. And it feels like when Melrose Place got cancelled. I mean... oh, forget it. I miss Melrose Place!
You know, I had a chance to stop her too!
Yeah?
Who loses fifty seven coin tosses in a row? Head she wins, tails I lose. Wait a minute...
Yes, Joe?
I forgot to pick up my dry cleaning!
You doing ok?
Well, I've been better.
Uh-hmm.
You guys are gonna come and visit me, right?
Yes! You know, in six months the Statute of Limitations runs out and I can travel internationally again!
I'm gonna miss you so much.
I know.
You know what? Uhm, I have some goodbye stuff that I wanted to say to each of you and I was gonna save it until the end of the night, but come here .
Hey, what do you think they're doing in there?
Huh, if I had to guess I'd say Rachel is putting on the bubble wrap and Phoebe is doing the punching.
Oh, Pheebs, I don't even know where to start.
Ok well, before you do, I know we weren't supposed to get you going away presents, but I do have something for you.
Oh, oh. . What is this?
It's a cotton swab with a bit of my saliva on it, so that if they perfect the cloning process while you are over there, you can use the DNA to create your own Pheebs!
I'm gonna throw this away, but thank you so much for the gesture!
Chandler? I was just in our bedroom and I found these on my pillow.
Oh, yes. I decided to leave these out for you in case Richard stops by and you wanna engage on a little light bondage and moustache play!
What are you talking about? These aren't mine.
Oh yeah, right! Good luck getting another scarf dance from me!
That would be a terrible punishment. But, I'm serious, I've never seen these before.
Really? Then what are they doing in our guestroom?
Rachel used to live in that room.
Rachel... with handcuffs! Interesting!
Joey's bare ass!
. Well played.
I love you Phoebe.
I love you too. Please don't... Don't turn into... you know... French bitch!
All right. Well, if I gonna do this, I'd better keep going.
Ok.
Ok. Monica?
Yeah?
Can you come here with me for a minute?
Sure.
Are you wearing waterproof mascara?
No.
Oh, you're so screwed.
Hey. What was that all about?
She's gonna say goodbye to each of us individually.
Are you kidding? Oh my God...
Yeah, I know, it's gonna be even worse for you... God... Ross, get ready to do some serious crying.
Oh, man, I'm not going to be able to handle this. Now I know how my students feel at the end of each year. And why they act out by giving me such bad evaluations.
Mon... Okay... I've gotta... just say what it is I'm gonna say... None of the amazing things that have happened to me in the last ten years, would have happened if it wasn't for you. No-one has been more like a sister to me...
I know what you mean. You're like a sister to me too.
I wouldn't know what I'm gonna do without you...
You're the best friend I ever had.
What?
I... I... I...
That is so sweet.
Oh no, she took down Monica... And I'm the crier in the family. Oh God! I could be next. Maybe she won't talk with me if it looks like we're deep in converstation. Oh, so that thing you said about the thing. It really made me think about that other thing.
Uh, Rach?
Well it's okay. Chandler is talking to her.
I really made you think about that thing uh?
Uh, Rach... I think I have something that belongs to you.
Oh, I'm sure gonna miss pretending to laugh at your weird jokes that I don't get.
No, no, no... They're really yours. We... found them in your old room.
Well, these aren't mine. Maybe Monica used to use them with...
Don't say Richard! Well, if they're not Monica's and they're not yours, then whose are they?
Well, I think you're forgetting the kinkiest former resident of that room.
Pheebs!
Yeah!
I think these are yours.
These are not mine... Look how flimsy they are, come on! Good God! You try to hang a guy from a waterpipe with these, they'll snap like a piece of licorice.
Can I talk to you alone for a minute?
Sure. You don't really handcuff guys to waterpipes do you?
Where do you think Mike really is?
Oh honey...
Let me just say something... Because once we get into this, I'm gonna get all uncomfortable and probably make some stupid joke... I just want to say that I... I love you... And, I'm gonna miss you. And I'm so sad that you're leaving.
Oh, you know what? Let's not say anything else. I love you.
Ooh, not so tight... I'm sorry, just give me one more chance.
Okay. Oh...
Oh!
I'm sor... Just go. Just go. I can't, I can't.
So, I guess you're next. You're ready?
I don't think so.
Oh, you're definately not. I haven't cried like that in years.
You cried yesterday at the six o'clock news.
That old woman was being scammed by her mechanic.
God! I can't believe she saved me for last. Why are they taking so long?
I don't know. But, God, Joey seems to be handling it suprisingly well.
No, no, no, no!
Okay, here we go...
Oh... Well...
Yeah...
I think I'm gonna take off.
Huh?
Oh, you guys. This was an amazing night. Thank you so much. I love you. Good night.
What? I don't get a goodbye?
Lucky bastard!
Unbelievable. She says goodbye to everyone but me.
Well, maybe she thought that with all of your history it could be, you know, implicit.
Well, it needs to be plicit.
All right, let's think about this. I mean, there's got to be an explanation. Uh... did you do anything to make her mad?
No, I don't think so.
You know, maybe she was just really spent from our talk. It was pretty intense.
Yeah. Mine too.
Mine was a humdinger.
O-kay... I mean, don't I deserve anything? I mean, a few tears, a cursory hug? NOT FROM YOU!
Ross, if you're this upset, you should go and talk to her.
And say what? "You owe me a goodbye", I mean, he's got more pride than that.
THE HELL I DO!
I don't get a goodbye?
What?
Everyone gets a goodbye but me? What have I got to do to get a goodbye, huh? Be best friends with you? Uh, go out with you? Have a baby with you? Oh wait a minute, wait a minute, I did all those things.
Ross...
Oh no, maybe it's me, I'm just not giving you enough credit. Uh, I mean it is difficult to say goodbye to five people. Uh, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, good... IT'S PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE. You know what? After all we've been through, I can't believe this is how you want to leave things between us. Have a, have a good time in Paris.
I hope Ross isn't too upset.
I'm sure he's not more bummed out than I am.
Tell me about it.
Well, you can't say we don't know how to throw a party.
All right, I think I'm gonna head out.
Uh, where do you think you're going?
I thought I was going home to go to bed, but I'm sensing there's something less fun for me to do here.
We're moving in a couple of days and we've got a lot of packing to do. It would be great if you guys could pitch in.
Joey and I can finish up in the guest room.
Oh, yeah, yeah, good idea.
Oh no! You and Phoebe are gonna help me in here.
You couldn't be cool.
Okay, we're gonna start in the kitchen. Plates get put into plate protectors and stacked ten to a box. The silverware gets bundled in rubber bands and then bubble wrapped. Got it?
Yeah.
Good! Now I need you to be careful and efficient. And remember, if I am harsh with you, it is only because you are doing it wrong.
Hey Mon, I think I figured out whose handcuffs they are.
You did? How?
Well, I was cleaning out the closet and I found some pictures of them... being used.
Oh my God! Let me see.
Who's that dirty old lady?
Monica's grandmother.
Nana liked it rough!
Hi!
Hey!
Come on here, have a seat.
How was your night?
Oh, it was okay. I went to a movie with my cousin and then out for dinner. We went to this place that had... Ooh... Hoo... ooh... Anyway, they had these really amazing cheeseburgers.
Erica, are you okay?
Yeah, you know, maybe I ate too much. I keep getting these stomach aches. They come and go like every few minutes.
Oh my God!
Relax! We just get her some antacids.
She doesn't have a stomach ache, she's in labor.
Oh my God!
Yeah, you got to get to the hospital.
All right, Chandler get the coats. Erica let's go. Phoebe and Joey, keep packing! Oh my God we're gonna have a baby. All right. We're gonna have a baby! OH MY GOD, WE'RE GONNA HAVE A BABY! Oh God, oh God, I got to sit down, I got to sit down. Ooh!
Honey, it's gonna be okay.
You can do this. Just breathe.
Okay, okay... Okay, I feel a little better.
Ooh! Are you sure?
Oh... Yes, I'm sure. Oh honey, let's go. Okay bye everyone.
Chandler, wait, wait, wait...
What?
If you get a second, find out where she got that cheeseburger.
You really think I didn't say goodbye to you because I don't care?
That's what it seemed like.
I cannot believe that after ten years, you do not know ONE thing about me.
Fine, then why didn't you say something?
Because it is too damn hard Ross. I can't even begin to explain to you how much I'm gonna miss you. When I think about not seeing you every day, it makes me not want to go... Okay, so if you think that I didn't say goodbye to you because you don't mean as much to me as everybody else, you're wrong. It's because you mean more to me. So there, all right, there's your goodbye... Oh!
Rach!
What?
You keep, you keep... You can't...
WHAT?
A little more.
Okay.
A little more, a little more. A little more... All right. Okay, all right, let's do this.
All right, ready?
Yeah. All right, now give me your best shot.
All right, here it goes...
Doesn't work...
Previously on Friends.
Erica, are you okay?
Yeah, you know, maybe I ate too much. I keep getting these stomach-aches. They come and go like every few minutes.
Oh my God!
Relax! We'll just get her some antacids.
She doesn't have a stomach-ache. She's in labor!
Oh my God!
So if you think I didn't say goodbye to you because you don't mean as much to me as everybody else, you're wrong. It's because you mean more to me.
Rach!
What?!
Hey.
Shh.. Go back to sleep. I have to go home.
Oh. This was amazing.
It really was. You've learned some new moves!
Yeah, well, this guy at work gave me "Sex for Dummies" as a joke.
Ah.
Who's laughing now?
I know!
Breathe, breathe, breathe... Good.
Next time, can I say breathe?
No, last time you said it like Dracula, and it scared her! Can I get you anything? You want some more ice chips?
No, I'm okay.
Alright, I'll be right back.
Where are you going?
To use the bathroom.
You can't leave me alone with her.
What?
This is exactly the kind of social situation that I am not comfortable with!
What kind of social situation are you comfortable with?
It's just that we've never spent any time, you know, alone together.
You'll be fine. Nah, you won't, but I'll be back in two minutes.
Okay.
So, ah... Any plans for the summer?
I don't know. Maybe church-camp?
Hah. May not wanna mention this. So, you ever wonder which is worse, you know; going through labor or getting kicked in the nuts?
What?
Well, it's just interesting. You know, because no one will ever know, because no one can experience both.
One of life's great, unanswerable questions. I mean, who knows? Maybe there's something even more painful than those things? Like this.
Morning.
Hey!
What's that?
It's my house-warming present for Monica and Chandler.
It's a baby chick and duck!
Uh-huh. And I named them Chick Jr. and Duck Jr.
I did not see that coming.
Yeah, I figure they'll love it at the new house, you know? It has that big backyard. And then, when they get old, they can go to that special farm that Chandler took the other chick and duck to.
Yes.
Yeah. It's a shame people can't visit there.
That is the rule, though.
Guess what? You're almost an uncle!
What?
Yeah, Erica went into labor last night. Monica and Chandler are at the hospital right now!
Oh my God!
Yeah, and I have a definite feeling it's gonna be a girl.
Phoebe, you were sure Ben was gonna be a girl.
Have you seen him throw a ball?
Is Rachel here?
Uh, I think she's still asleep. Hey, hey, how did it go with you guys last night? She seemed pretty pissed at you.
Uh, we, y'know, we worked things out.
What's that smile? Did something happen with you two?
Hey, I'm not one to kiss and tell, but I'm also not one to have sex and shut up. We totally did it!
Oh my God. You and Rachel?
I know, it's pretty great.
So what does that mean? Are you guys getting back together?
Oh, I.. I don't know. We didn't really get to talk.
But do you wanna get back together?
I don't know. It was incredible. I mean, it just felt so right. When I was holding her, I mean, I never wanted to let her go. You know what? Yeah, I do. I wanna be together.
YAY!
Shhh!
Yay!
So, so is she still going to Paris?
Wow, I hadn't thought of that. I hope not.
Oh, this is like the best day ever. Ever! You guys might get back together, Monica and Chandler are getting their baby, there are chicks and ducks in the world again! Oh, I feel like I'm in a musical! "Daa - raa... When the sun comes up, bright and beaming! And the moon comes..."
Morning!
Guess we'll never know how it ends.
Okay.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey. How did you sleep?
Good. You?
Good.
I bet you did!
Uh. Would you guys mind giving us a minute?
Sure, yeah. Will you just keep an eye on the chick and the duck?
Chick and the duck? Didn't they die...
Dive. Yeah, they dove head-first into fun on the farm.
So...
Morning.
You too. Last night was just wonderful.
It really was.
I woke up today with the biggest smile on my face.
I know, me too. It was... You know, it was like one of those things you think is never gonna happen, and then it does, and it's everything you want it to be.
Uh-huh. I know. It was just, it was just the perfect way to say goodbye.
It's just a little bit more, honey.
Help me! This hurts!
Is it really that bad?
Uh-huh! I think it's time to kick you in the nuts and see which is worse!
The baby's head is crowning.
Oh! Oh my God! That is the most beautiful top of a head I have ever seen! Chandler, you have to see this!
I'm okay.
Chandler, you don't wanna miss this. This is the birth of your child! It's the miracle of life!
Alright. Wow, that is one disgusting miracle.
Start pushing. Here we go. Here come the shoulders...
It's a... It's a boy!
Wow!
Is he okay?
He's just fine.
Oh, you did it!
It's a baby! A beautiful little baby! And some other stuff I'm gonna pretend I don't see.
Would you like to cut the umbilical cord?
Well, that's spongy.
Oh, hey handsome! Oh, I'm gonna love you so much that no woman is ever gonna be good enough for you! Oh, we are so lucky!
I know. He has your eyes.
I mean, I know that's not possible, but he does.
We'll just get him cleaned up a bit.
Okay.
Oh my God, he's beautiful. Thank you so much.
I'm really happy for you guys.
How do you feel?
I'm tired!
Well, you don't have that much time to relax. The other one will be along in a minute.
I... I'm sorry, who should be along in a what now?
The next baby should be along in a minute.
We only ordered one!
You know it's twins, right?
Oh, yeah! These are the faces of two people in the know!
I can't believe you didn't know it's twins! This has never happened before.
Well, gosh. That makes me feel so special and good.
Wait, did you know it was twins?
Yeah, it's here in the paperwork we got from the clinic in Ohio.
Anybody tell you?
I don't think so. Although, they did mention something about two heartbeats. But I thought that was just mine and the baby's. They kept saying both heartbeats are really strong, and I thought well, that's good 'cause I'm having a baby.
This is unbelievable.
Twins actually run in my family.
Interesting! Can I see you for a second?
What do we do?
What do you mean "what do we do"?
Twins! Twins!!
Chandler, you're panicking!
Uh-huh! Join me, won't you?! Okay, what do you say we keep one, and then just like have an option on the other one?
We can't split them up!
Why not? We could give each of them half a medallion, and then years later, they'll find each other and be reunited. I mean, that's a great day for everybody.
Okay, what if the person who adopts the other one is horrible?
What if they're not? What if it's adopted by a king?
Yeah, because I hear the king is looking to adopt.
Monica, we are not ready to have two babies!
That doesn't matter! We have waited so long for this. I don't care if it's two babies. I don't care if it's three babies! I don't care if the entire cast of "Eight is Enough" comes out of there! We are taking them home, because they are our children!
Okay. Shhh...
Okay.
Okay!
Okay!
It looks like we're about ready over here.
Come on, Erica, start pushing again now.
Ow!
Here she comes!
She? It's a girl?
Yeah.
Well, now we have one of each! And that's enough!
And then she said it was the perfect way to say goodbye.
Oh my God! What did you say?
Nothing! What do you say to that?
Ross, you've got to tell her how you feel!
No way!
You can't just give up! Is that what a dinosaur would do?
What?
Dude, I'm just trying to speak your language.
Ross, Rachel doesn't know that you wanna get back together. If she did, she might feel differently. She might not even go.
You really think so?
I'm telling you! Oh, okay! This is the part of the musical where there'd be a really good convincing song. "Bam-bam, don't take no for an answer. Bam-bam, don't let love fly away. Bam-bam-bam-bam..."
Hi!
Can't a girl finish a song around here?
Hey!
Hi! So I just dropped Emma off at my mom's.
Okay.
Oh, you're not taking her with you tonight?
No, we decided that I would go ahead and set up first, and then my mom would bring Emma to Paris on Sunday.
Wow, eight hour flight with a one-year old? Good luck, mom.
Are you kidding? Eight hours with my mother talking about Atkins? Good luck, Emma!
Alright, you know what? You're right. I should at least tell her how I feel.
Ross, wait!
What? What?
Could you get me a muffin?
Rachel?
Yeah?
I... I know you're leaving tonight, but I just have to tell you. I love you.
I... I don't know if that changes your plans at all, but I thought you should know.
Gunther... Oh... I love you too. Probably not in the same way, but I do. And, and when I'm in a cafe, having coffee, or I see a man with hair brighter than the sun, I'll think of you. Aw.
Oh... Bye guys.
Oh my God!
Unbelievable!
Hey, you know what might help?
I'm not getting you a muffin!
Do you think they recognize each other from in there?
Maybe. Unless they're like two people who have lived in apartments next to each other for years, and then one day they're pushed through a vagina and they meet.
We're going to take Erica to recovery now.
There's something that we wanna tell you. We decided to name the girl-baby Erica.
Oh my God, that's just like my name!
Son of a gun, it is!
Anyway, I'm gonna go and get some rest. I'm really glad I picked you guys. You're gonna make great parents. Even Chandler.
Okay, well, bye!
Bye!
Bye!
We'll call you!
Okay.
Have fun at church-camp!
Oh, look at these little bunnies!
I know! You ready to trade?
Okay.
Okay.
Alright, let's see..
We could trade later.
Yeah, I'm good.
Hey, what are you working on?
It's a... It's a "welcome home" sign for the baby.
How sweet! Oh, is that the baby?
No, I sat in the paint.
Hey.
Hey. So, did you talk to Rachel?
No, and I'm not going to.
What?
Why not?
Because she's just going to shoot me down. You guys saw what happened with Gunther. That did not look like fun.
How can you compare yourself to Gunther? I mean, sure, he's sexy in a more obvious way. You have a relationship with her, you slept together last night.
Yeah, and she still wants to go! It's pretty clear where she is.
Yeah, I know what you mean. I mean, sometimes...
Uh, Joe?
Damn it!
Look, even if I were gonna tell her, I don't have to do it now. Okay? I'll be seeing her again. We've got time.
No, you don't! She's going to Paris! She is going to meet somebody. Do you know how many hot guys there are in Paris? It's... It's a city of Gunthers!
Hey!
Hey! What do you have there?
Oh, I made a little something. If I had more time to work on it, it'd be better, but..
Oh my God! You did that yourself?
Honey, that's gorgeous!
You know, the baby can't read, Mike!
Hi! You guys, the car-service just got here. I can't believe they're not home yet! I have to catch my stupid plane. I wanna see the baby!
Monica just called from the cab. She said they should be here any minute. And apparently, there's some big surprise.
Yeah, did she sound happy about it? 'Cause my friend Ethel's baby was born with a teeny, tiny beard.
Oh my God!
Oh my God!
Hi! Oh my gosh!
Hey.
Hey.
Hey, so what is the big surprise?
Oh.
Oh my God!
What... What...
Okay, okay, awkward question. The hospital knows you took two, right?
Yes, it's twins!
Oh my God.
Oh, they're so cute! Now, what, what kinds are they?
This is a boy, and that's a girl.
Her name is Erica.
Aw..
Hey, that pregnant girl's name was Erica.
Yeah. It's a shame you two didn't get to spend more time together.
Yeah, we named the boy Jack after dad.
Aw, he's gonna be so happy.
Oh, Jack Bing. I love that. Ooh, it sounds like a '40s newspaper guy, you know? "Jack Bing, Morning Gazette. I'm gonna blow this story wide open!"
Oh my gosh. Wow, so beautiful.
I want one.
Oh yeah? Well, tell me which one, and I'll try slip it in my coat.
Seriously. Wanna make one of those?
One? How about a whole bunch?
Really?
Yeah! Ooh, we could teach them to sing, and we can be like the Von Trapp family! Only without the Nazis. Although that sounds kinda dull.
Oh, you guys, I can't believe this. But I'll leave now, or I'm gonna miss my plane.
I'm just so glad you got to see the babies.
Me too. Oh, I'm just sorry I'm not gonna be around to watch you two attempt to handle this! Alright, I can't say goodbye to you guys again. I love you all so much.
I love you.
I love you.
Call us when you get there.
I will. Ross, come here.
I just want you to know.. Last night.. I'll never forget it.
Neither will I.
Alright, now I really have to go. Okay. Au revoir! Oh, they're gonna really hate me over there.
So, you just let her go?
Yeah.
Hey, maybe that's for the best.
Yeah?
Yeah. You know? You just... Look, you gotta... You gotta think about last night the way she does, okay? Maybe, maybe sleeping together was the perfect way to say goodbye?
But now she'll never know how he feels!
Maybe that's okay. You know? Maybe, maybe it is better this way? I mean, now, now you can move on. I mean, you've been trying to for so long, maybe now that you're on different continents.. Right?
Maybe now you can actually do it. You know? You can finally get over her.
Yeah, that's true. Except I don't wanna get over her.
What?
I don't! I wanna be with her.
Really?
Yeah, I'm gonna go after her.
Yeah, you are!
Woo!
Wait, wait! Get your coat! Get your coat!
My coat...
This is so cool!
I have no idea what's going on, but I am excited!
But Ross, Ross. What do you, what do you think she's going to say?
I don't know, but I.. Look, even if she shoots me down, at least I won't spend the rest of my life wondering what would have happened. Where - where is my coat?!
You didn't bring one! My cab's downstairs, I'll drive you to the airport.
Okay, guys, wish me luck.
Hurry!
Good luck, good luck!
There's no seatbelt!
That's okay. If - if we hit anything, the engine will explode, so you know, it's better if you're thrown from the car.
Alright, alright, let's do this!
Okay!
Hey!
18th and East End.
I - I don't take passengers.
Hey! The law says you have to accept any fare.
No, you don't understand. This isn't a real cab.
Alright, I gotta report you. What's your medallion number?
My medallion number is, "Get out of the cab!"
What?
Get out of the cab!
Get out of the cab!
Oh, hey, hey, can I give you guys your house-warming present now?
Now, that you can do.
Alright!
Ah... Chick Jr.? Duck Jr.? Don't hide from mama!
You can open your eyes now.
Are we off the bridge?
Yes.
Is the old woman on the bicycle still alive?
Yes, she jumped right back up.
Oh my God, Phoebe, slow down!
Do you wanna get to Rachel in time?
Yes, but I don't wanna die in your cab!
You should have thought of that before you got in!
Toll-booth.
What?
Toll-booth! Four bucks. There are quarters in the glove compartment.
Hurry!
Okay!
Okay.
Damn, that window is clean.
Quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, tweet, quack...
We were wondering what was taking so long with the gift, but now we understand you were doing this.
Okay, I wanted to surprise you, but for your house-warming gift, I got you a baby-chick and a baby-duck!
Really? You got us a chick and a duck?
Oh, great! Just what you want for a new house with infants. Bird feces.
Yeah, yeah, they must have jumped off the table, 'cause now they're gone!
Oh, don't worry, we'll find them.
Actually, I'm gonna go check on the twins.
Alright.
Oh God! What did I just step on?
Oh!
It's okay, it's just an egg roll.
Oh..
You stepped on my egg roll?
I'm sorry, I didn't know to look for Chinese food on the floor.
Just put it on a plate and leave.
Okay, let's find these birds.
Alright.
Wait, wait. Do you hear that?
Oh! They're in the table!
Well, that can't be good!
We gotta get them out of there!
How?
Oh, oh! Maybe we can lure them out. You know any birdcalls?
Oh, tons, I'm quite the woodsman.
Well, maybe we can just tip the table a little.
Joey, wait! The ball!
Oh!
Oh God! So what do we do?
I don't know. Maybe we can open this up somehow.
Okay.
No... It's all glued together.
Does that mean we have to bust it open?
I don't know. Maybe.
Oh my God!
I know! It's.. It's the foosball table.
All right, you know what? We don't have a choice. It's like I would have said in that sci-fi movie if I'd gotten the part. "Those are our men in there, we have to get them out! Even if I have to sacrifice the most important thing in my life; my time-machine."
Did that movie ever get made?
It did not.
Ross, where are you going?
To talk to Rachel, isn't that why we took a ride in the death-cab?
What? What are you just gonna walk up to her at the gate? Have you never chased anyone through the airport before?
Not since my cop-show got cancelled.
You have to get a ticket to get past security.
What? We're never gonna make it!
Not with that attitude! Now, haul ass!
Okay, if you could all walk slower, that'd be great.
Madame, your passport please?
Oh my God! I was so afraid I wasn't gonna remember any of my high-school French, but I understood every word you just said!
Your boarding pass, please.
Oh.
Oh, shoot. I had it. Oh, I can't believe this.
Madame, if you don't have your boarding pass...
I have it, I have it, I have it. Oh, okay, I can't find it, but I remember that I was in seat 32C, because that's my bra-size.
Madame, you must have your boarding pass..
Okay, fine! But you know what? If I was in 36D, we would not be having this problem.
Hey, I need a ticket.
Just one? I drive you all the way down here, and I don't get to see how it works out?
Fine, two tickets, I need two tickets.
We're on our honeymoon.
And the destination?
I don't care. Whatever is the cheapest.
I'm so lucky I married you.
Oh! Shoot! Damn it! Where is it? Oh! Oh! I found it! I found it!
Hah! I found it! I told you I would find it! In your face! You're a different person.
Okay, flight 421 to Paris. I don't see it, do you see it?
No, did we miss it?
No, no, no. That's impossible. It doesn't leave for another 20 minutes.
Maybe we have the flight-number wrong. God.
Hello.
Hey, it's me. Here's Ross.
What? Hey, hey, listen..
Oh my God! Ross, you wouldn't believe the cute little noises the twins are making. Listen.
Monica? Monica, Monica, Monica, Monica..?
Oh, I'm sorry. Shoot, they were doing it before.
That's alright. Listen, listen.
Oh, wait, wait, wait! Here they go again.
Monica? Monica, Monica, Monica, Monica..?
Isn't that cute?
That is precious! Listen! I need Rachel's flight information.
Oh, okay. Alright, it's flight 421. Leaves at 8:40.
Yes, that's what I have. It's not on the board.
That's what it says here. Flight 421, leaves at 8:40, Newark airport.
What?
Newark airport. Why, where are you?
JFK.
Don't worry, you guys, we're gonna get you out of there.
And we're also gonna buy you tiny, bird hearing-aids.
Okay. Here goes.
What's the matter?
I need to say goodbye to the table first.
I understand.
Okay. Table, you have given us so many great times. And you guys, Jordan, Victor, Joel... All of you guys. What can I say? You guys make us look good. You wanna say anything?
I don't know. Except that, for one last time... Good game, good game, good game, good game, good game, good game, good game.
Okay, here we go. I can't do it.
Well, I can't do it either.
Hey! Did you find them?
Yeah, they're stuck inside the table!
We have to bust it open, but neither of us can do it!
Oh, well sure. This gotta be so hard. I'll do it. Gimme!
Phoebe! Wow! No, no, no!
Well, I've never gone this fast before.
Phoebe, forget it, okay? Newark is - is like an hour away. There's no way we're gonna make it in time.
She's got her cell, you could call her.
I am not doing this over the phone.
You don't have any other choice!
Hello?
Rachel? Oh, good. Hey, by the way, did you just get on the plane?
Yeah.
For what it's worth, we would have caught her if we were at the right airport.
Yay.
Uh, Rach, hang on.
Phoebe? Is everything okay?
Uhm, actually no. No, you've... You have to get off the plane.
What? Why?
I have this feeling that something's wrong with it. Something is wrong with the left Philange.
Oh, honey, I'm sure there's nothing wrong with the plane.
Alright, look, I have to go. I love you, and I will call you the minute I get to Paris.
Uhm, what was that?
Oh, that was just my crazy friend. She told me I should get off the plane, because she had a feeling that there was something wrong with the left Philange.
Okay, that doesn't sound good.
I wouldn't worry about it. She's always coming up with stuff like this, and you know what? She's almost never right.
But she is sometimes.
Well...
Wait, what are you doing?
Well, I can't take this plane now.
Excuse me, sir, where are you going?
I have to get off this plane, okay? Her friend has a feeling something's wrong with the left Philange.
Could I get some peanuts?
What's wrong with the plane?
There's nothing wrong with the plane.
Yeah! The left Philange!
There is no Philange!
Oh my God. This plane doesn't even have a Philange!
I'm not flying on it!
Ma'am, please sit down!
What's going on?
We're all getting off. There is no Philange!
This is ridiculous! I...
Yeah, okay.
Alright. My job here is done.
That was... Impressive.
Yeah, you didn't even use the tools for most of it!
Yeah, they were just slowing me down. Alright, I have to get back to the babies. I'll see you girls later.
Sorry about the table, man.
Yeah.
You gonna buy a new one?
Probably not. Nah. I don't know how much I'm gonna wanna play after you go.
Well, at least we got these little guys out.
Yeah.
Aww, we were worried about you! Hm. I guess I better get used to things crapping in my hand, huh?
I'm gonna miss these little guys. It was nice having birds around again.
Hey, you know what? Maybe we should keep them here with you.
What?
Yeah, I mean we've got a lot going on right now. And, plus, here they'd have their own room.
I could get a goose!
You know, I - I think you're set with the poultry.
Thanks man. Did you hear that, you guys? You're gonna get to stay here! And, and it's good, you know, 'cause, 'cause now you have a reason to come visit.
I think there may be another reason. So, awkward hug or lame cool guy handshake?
Uh, lame cool guy handshake, yeah.
Ma'am, I assure you, the plane is fine.
And you fixed the Philange?
Yes, the Philange is fixed. As a matter of fact, we put a whole lot of extra Philanges onboard, just in case.
Where is she?
I don't see her.
Rachel! Rachel Green!
There she is!
Rachel! Rachel!
Wow, excuse me, sir, do you have a boarding pass?
No, no, I just have to talk to someone.
I'm sorry, you cannot go any further without a boarding pass.
No, no, no, but...
RACHEL!!
Oh my God... What.. What are you guys doing here?
Okay, you're on.
What? What? Ross, you're scaring me. What's going on?
Okay, the thing is..
Yeah?
Don't go.
What?
Please, please stay with me. I am so in love with you. Please, don't go.
Oh my God.
I know, I know. I shouldn't have waited 'till now to say it, but I'm.. That was stupid, okay? I'm sorry, but I'm telling you now. I love you. Do not get on this plane.
Miss? Are you boarding the plane?
Hey, hey. I know you love me. I know you do.
Miss?
I - I have to get on the plane.
No, you don't.
Yes, I do.
No, you don't.
They're waiting for me, Ross. I can't do this right now, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Rachel?
I'm so sorry.
I really thought she'd stay.
I'm sorry.
Well, that's it. Everything's packed.
Wow, this is weird.
I know.
Yeah. Uh, does this mean there's nothing to eat?
I put three lasagnas in your freezer.
I love you!
Hey!
Hey.
So did you guys make it in time?
Yeah, yeah, he talked to her, but she got on the plane anyway.
Where's Ross?
He went home. He didn't want to see anybody.
Ross, hi. It's me. I just got back on the plane. And I just feel awful. That is so not how I wanted things to end with us. It's just that I wasn't expecting to see you, and all of a sudden you're there and saying these things... And... And now I'm just sitting here and thinking of all the stuff I should have said, and I didn't. I mean, I didn't even get to tell you that I love you too. Because of course I do. I love you. I love you. I love you. What am I doing? I love you! Oh, I've gotta see you. I've gotta get off this plane.
Oh my God!
Excuse me?
Miss? Please, sit down!
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry, but I need to get off the plane, okay? I need to tell someone that I love love them.
Miss, I can't let you off the plane.
Let her off the plane!
I am afraid you are gonna have to take a seat.
Oh, please, miss, you don't understand!
Try to understand!
Oh, come on, miss, isn't there any way that you can just let me off...
No! No! Oh my God. Did she get off the plane? Did she get off the plane?
I got off the plane.
You got off the plane.
I do love you.
I love you too, and I'm never letting you go again.
Okay. 'Cause this is where I wanna be, okay? No more messing around. I don't wanna mess this up again.
Me neither, okay? We are - we're done being stupid.
Okay. You and me, alright? This is it.
This is it. Unless we're on a break.
Don't make jokes now.
Okay, please be careful with that. It was my grandmother's. Be careful.
If that falls off the truck, it wouldn't be the worst thing.
Wow.
I know. It seems smaller somehow.
Has it always been purple?
Look around, you guys. This was your first home. And it was a happy place, filled with love and laughter. But more important, because of rent control, it was a friggin' steal!
Hey, do you realise that at one time or another we all lived in this apartment?
Oh, yeah, that's true.
Uh, I haven't.
Wait a minute. What about that summer during college that you lived with grandma, and you tried to make it as a dancer?
Do you realise we almost made it ten years without that coming up?
Oh, honey, I forgot. I promised Treeger that we'd leave our keys.
Oh, okay.
So, I guess this is it.
Yeah. I guess so.
This is harder than I thought it would be.
Oh, it's gonna be okay.
Do you guys have to go to the new house right away, or do you have some time?
We got some time.
Okay, should we get some coffee?
Sure. Where?
