Friends. Family. We are gathered to celebrate here today the joyous union of Ross and Emily. Now Ross, repeat after me. I Ross...
I Ross...
Take thee, Emily...
Take thee, Rachel... Emily. Emily.
Uhh...Shall I go on?
He-he said Rachel, right? Do you think I should go up there?
Yes, yes, do go on.
I think we'd better start again. Ross, repeat after me. I, Ross...
I, Ross...
Take thee, EM-I-LY...
Take thee, Emily. Like there'd be anybody else.
As my lawfully wedded wife, in sickness and in health, till death parts us.
As my lawfully wedded wife, in sickness and in health, until death parts us. Really, I do. Emily.
May I have the rings? Emily, place this ring on Ross's finger as a symbol of your bond everlasting. Ross, place this ring in Emily's hand as a symbol of the love that encircles you forever.
Happy too.
Ross and Emily have made their declarations and it gives me great pleasure to declare them husband and wife.
Yay!
You may kiss the bride.
This is worse than when he married the lesbian.
Just keep smiling.
Okay.
Well, that went well. Yeah.
It could've been worse, he could've shot her.
That uh, that was pretty funny. Wasn't it?
You've spoiled everything! It's like a nightmare! My friends and family are out there! How can I face them?! How can you do this to me?!
Hey, no matter what happens with Ross and Emily, we still get cake right?
That-that-that's all right, no honey, you take your time sweetie. I'll be right out here. She's just fixing her makeup.
I hate you!!
And, I love you!!
Boy, bad time to say the wrong name, huh Ross?
That's true, thanks dad. People should be dancing! Huh? Hey, this is a party! Come on! Joey, dance!!
Yes, Waltham interiors.
Uh, hello, this is Ross Geller's personal physician, Dr. Philange.
Who?
Yeah, I've discovered that Ross forgot to take his brain medicine, uh, now without it, uh, in the brain of Ross, uh women's names are interchangeable, through-through no fault of his own.
Oh my God, Phoebe.
No, not Phoebe, Dr. Philange. Oh no! You have it too!
Hello?
Hey.
Hey.
Oh wow, I hope you don't take this the wrong way but, I know we had plans to meet up tonight and, ugh, I'm just kinda worried about what it might do to our friendship.
I know. How could we have let this happen?
Seven times!
Ugh! Well, y'know, we were away...
In a foreign, romantic country...
I blame London.
Bad London!
So look umm, while we're st-still in London, I mean, we can keep doing it right?
Well, I don't see that we have a choice. But, when we're back home, we don't do it.
Only here.
Y'know, I saw a wine cellar downstairs...
I'll meet you there in two minutes.
Okay!
Mon, honey, I gotta ask you something.
Now?
Ross said my name up there, I mean, come on, I just can't pretend that didn't happen can I?
Oh, I-I don't know.
Monica, what should I do?
Just uh, do the right thing.
What?
Toe the line. Thread the needle. Think outside the box!
Whoa, wait, listen, I think I'm just gonna talk to Ross about what he think it meant.
Wait. Rachel, no, he's married. Married! If you don't realize that, I can't help you.
Okay, you're right. You're right. You can't help me.
Jack, is it all our fault? Were we bad parents?
Yes.
Oh yeah, well who serves steak when there's no place to sit, I mean how are you supposed to eat this?
Hey, what's up?
Where were you? We were supposed to meet in the wine cellar?
Forget it, that's off.
Why?!
The next tour of the wine cellar will plan in two in-in minutes...
Joey, what are you doing? You promised Phoebe you wouldn't eat meat until she has the babies!
Well, I figured we're in another country, so it doesn't count.
That's true.
The man's got a point.
Oh, hi!
Hi!
Hi. Sorry, things aren't working out so well.
Oh no! It could be better, but it's gonna be okay, right?
Oh yeah! Of course, I mean, she's gonna get over this, y'know? I mean, so you said my name! Y'know you just said it 'cause you saw me there, if you'd have seen a circus freak, you would've said, "I take thee circus freak." Y'know, it didn't mean anything, it's just a mistake. It didn't mean anything. Right?
No! No! Of course it didn't mean anything! I mean, uh well, I can understand why Emily would think it meant something, y'know, because-because it was you...
Right...
But it absolutely didn't. It didn't!! It didn't!!
Ross, hey, the band's ready outside for your first dance with Emily, so...
Oh! Oh-oh, the band's ready! Well, I-I-we gotta do what the band says-I don't care about the stupid band!!
You spit on me man!
Look, I'm sorry.
Emily is kinda taking a long time, huh?
Y'know when I locked myself in the bathroom at my wedding, it was because I was trying to pop the window out of the frame.
Oh, right!
Get the hell out of there, y'know?
Emily? Emily? I'm coming in.
Well, look at that, same thing.
Listen, in the middle of everything if I scream the word, "Yippee!" just ignore me.
Oh my God, Rachel! Hi!
Oh, hello Rachel.
Ross said my name. Okay? My name. Ross said my name up there that obviously means that he still loves me! Okay, don't believe me, I know I'm right-do you guys want to go downstairs and get a drink?
Yes, we do. But, we have to change first.
Yes, I want to change. And why-why don't you go down and get us a table?
Yeah, we'll be down in like five minutes.
Fifteen minutes.
Okay.
Hello? Oh, Pheebs! It's Phoebe!
Oh, yay...
Great...
Hi!
Hi, so what happened?
Well, Ross said my name.
Yeah, I know, but I don't think that means anything.
Okay, Pheebs, y'know what, let's look at this objectively all right? Ninth grade, right? The obsession starts. All right? The summer after ninth grade he sees me in a two-piece for the first time, his obsession begins to grow. So then...
Hey, listen, why don't we go change in my room?
But my clothes are-ohh!
Wow, you look...
No time for that!
Hey, dude, let me in. I got a girl out here!
Well, I've got a girl in here.
No you don't, I just saw you go in there with Monica!
Well, we're-we're hanging out in here!
Look, which one of us is gonna be having sex in there, me or you?
Well, I suppose I'd have to say you!! But, what if we're watching a movie in here?
Which we are, and-and we already paid for it. It's My Giant!
My Giant? I love that movie!
You really think this is okay?
Well, Ross and Emily aren't gonna use it.
Oh, it's so beautiful. Ohh! Y'know, I-I don't know if I feel right about this.
Oh Mon-Mon-Mon-Mon-look, this is the honeymoon suite. The room expects sex. The room would be disappointed if it didn't get sex. All of the other honeymoon suites would think it was a loser.
Okay!
Okay!
Emily?!
Nope, not under here!
You didn't find her?
No, I've looked everywhere!
Well, you couldn't have looked everywhere or else you would've found her!
Yeah, I think you should keep looking!
Yeah, for about 30 minutes.
Or 45.
Wow, in 45 minutes you can find her twice.
No! For all I know, she's trying to find me but couldn't because I kept moving around. No, from now on, I'm staying in one place. Right here.
Well, it's getting late.
Yeah, we're gonna go.
Actually, do you guys mind staying here for a while?
Ugh, y'know, umm we gotta get up early and catch that plane for New York.
Yeah, it's a very large plane.
That's cool.
But, we'll stay here with you.
Thanks guys! I really appreciate this, y'know, but you don't have to rub my butt.
We have to leave for New York in an hour.
I know, I've been looking at those doors, they look pretty sound proof, don't you think?
We can't do that that's insane. I mean 'A' he could wake up and 'B' y'know, let's go for it.
Em-Emily? Em-Emily? Emily!
No.
You can forget about Emily, she's not with us.
We've come for her things.
Wait, well wh-wh-wh-where is she?
She's in hiding. She's utterly humiliated. She doesn't want to see you ever again.
We're very sad that it didn't work out between you and Emily, monkey. But, I think you're absolutely delicious.
Excuse me, I'm standing right here!
Oh yes, there you are.
Hey-hey, you guys oh hurry up, get some, there's a whole cart outside...
Goodbye Geller.
Now, hold on! Hold on! Look, look, your daughter and I are supposed to leave tonight for our honeymoon, now-now you-you tell her that I'm gonna be at that airport and I hope that she'll be there too! Oh yeah, I said Rachel's name, but it didn't mean anything, Okay? She's-she's just a friend and that's all! That's all! Now just tell Emily that I love her and that I can't imagine spending my life with anyone else. Please, promise me that you'll tell her that.
All right, I'll tell her. Come on bugger face!
Call me.
You spend half your life in the bathroom, why don't you ever go out the bloody window!
Y'know, maybe it's best that we never got to do it again.
Yeah, it kinda makes that-that one night special. Y'know, technically we still are over international waters.
I'm gonna go to the bathroom, maybe I'll see you there in a bit?
'Kay!
Can I ask you something?
Uhh, no.
Felicity and I, we're watching My Giant, and I was thinking, "I'm never gonna be as good an actor as that giant." Do you think I'm just wasting my life with this acting thing?
No.
I mean, the giant is like five years younger than me, y'know, you think I'll ever get there?
Yes.
Thanks man.
Okay man.
But what about how much taller he is than me?
I mean, there's no way I can make myself taller now, y'know? And who knows what science will come up with in the future, but Chandler, what if I die an unsuccessful, regular sized man?
Hey, Monica, wow you've been in the bathroom for like a half-hour.
I know!
Had the beef-tips, huh?
Hey!
Hey!
Hi!
You ate meat! You had sex!
No we didn't!
I know you didn't, I was talking about Monica.
Phoebe, I did not have sex.
This pregnancy is throwing me all off.
All right, I'm gonna go say hi the chick and the duck.
Oh, me too!
Why would you need to say hi to them, you've been feeding them for four days?
Oh right, maybe I'll just go home.
Well, we certainly are alone.
Yes! Good thing we have that, 'Not in New York' rule.
Right. Umm, listen since we're-we-re on that subject, umm, I just wanted to tell you that uh, well, I-I was going through a really hard time in London, what with my brother getting married and that guy thinking I was Ross's mother...
Right.
Well, an-anyway, I just-that night meant a lot to me, I guess I'm just trying to say thanks.
Oh. Y'know, that night meant a lot to me too, and it wasn't because I was in a bad place or anything, it just meant a lot to me 'cause, you're really hot! Is that okay?
That's okay.
And I'm cute too.
And you're cute too.
Thank you! All right, I gotta go unpack.
Okay.
Bye.
I'm still on London time, does that count?
That counts!
Oh, good!
Rach! Rach!
Hi!
Hi! What are you, what are you doing here?
Well, I-I-I've been on Standby for a flight home for hours.
Oh.
Ohh, so no sign of Emily huh?
Not yet.
So umm, what time are you supposed to leave?
This is the last call for Flight 1066 to Athens. The last call.
Pretty soon I guess.
Yeah. I'm sorry.
I just, I don't understand, I mean, how-how can she do this? Y'know, what, am I, am I like a complete idiot for thinking that she'd actually show up?
No, you're not an idiot, Ross. You're a guy very much in love.
Same difference.
All ticketed passengers for Flight 1066 to Athens should now be on board.
I get it! Well, that's that.
No, you know what, I think you should go.
What?
Yeah, I do. I think you should go, by yourself, get some distance, clear your head, I think it'd be really good.
Oh, I don't, I don't, I don't know...
Oh, come on Ross! I think it would be really good for you!
I could, yeah, I can do that.
Yeah.
I can't, I can't even believe her! No, y'know what, I am, I am gonna go!
Good!
I know, why not?
Right!
Right?
Right!
Y'know-thanks!
Okay, I'll see you back at home, if I ever get a flight out of here.
Yeah, well...nah.
What? Wait, what?
Why don't you come, I mean, I-I have two tickets, why not?
Well-well, I don't know Ross-really?
Yeah, yeah, it'll be great! You can, you can lay on the beach and I can cry over my failed marriage. See-see how I make jokes?
Uh-huh.
No really, I mean, I mean, God, I could use a friend.
Oh wow, uh okay, uh maybe. Umm, yes, I can do that!
Okay!
Okay!
Cool!
All right!
Come on! Here.
Oh, okay, we're going. Yeah.
Ah! Ah! I forgot my jacket!
Oh, wait-wait-wait...
You tell them to wait!
Okay. Wait! Wait!
Emily.
Oh no-no-no! Oh-no! No! No! Emily!
Ahh, yes, I will have a glass of the Merlot and uh, he will have a white wine spritzer. Woo! Hey, look at that, the airport's moving. Hey, are we moving?! Are we moving? Why are we moving? Hey, time-out, umm, yeah, does the captain know that we're moving? Oh my God. Oh, my gosh.
You look cute in bubbles.
Ehh, you're just liquored up.
Hey, it's me! I'm comin' in!
I've had a very long, hard day.
Ahh, I'm gonna go get some chicken. Want some?
Ahh, no thanks. No chicken, bye-bye then.
Okay.
You sure? Some extra crispy? Dirty rice? Beans?
For the last time no! Get out! Get out, Joey!
All right!
Are you okay? I'm so sorry, he wouldn't leave. He kept asking me about chicken.
Chicken? I could eat some chicken.
Hey Joe!
Yeah, can I get a 3-piece, some cole slaw, some beans, and a Coke-(Yelps in
Hey!
Hey, Pheebs!
Mornin' Pheebs!
I have to tell you this story. Okay, I was coming over here and this driver...
Was his name Angus?
What?
Oh, he was this cab driver we had in London.
Oh. Ha-ha-ha. All right, anyway...
Wait, what that place, that pub he took us too?
Uh, The Wheatsheaf.
Yeah-yeah-yeah, and they had that beer! That uh...
Bodington's!
Bodington's! Woohoo!
Ooh! Ahh, Pheebs, was gonna tell a story.
Yeah, so, he had a really funny hat-I don't want to talk about it.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey, Ross, Bodington's!
Yeah!
That was good beer.
Ohh...
Y'know, I'd walk back to London for another frosty one of those bad boys.
Y'know, I think they have those at that British pub near the trade center.
Later!
Isn't Rachel supposed to be back by now?
Yeah, but her plane got delayed in Athens. But actually, she should be here by now.
Oh, so-so you talked to her. Did she, did she sound mad?
No, but she likes me. You abandoned her on a plane to Greece.
Okay, I did not abandon Rachel! Okay? Emily showed up at the airport! I had to go after her! I mean, I-I did what I had to do! She's my wife! Rachel is my wife! Y'know-Emily! Emily, is my wife! Man, what is that?
So you still hadn't heard from Emily?
No, not since I lost her at the airport.
I can't believe she can out run you man!
HEY, SHE'S FAST!! OKAY?!! Oh! You-you think you can be beat me? Let's go! Outside!!
Hi!
Hey!
Rach, Rach, I am so sorry. I am so-so sorry.
Oh Ross, come on! You just did what you had to do.
That's it? You're not mad? I mean, it must've been terrible.
Terrible? Hell, I was in Greece! That was a nice hotel! Nice beach, met the nice people. Not to shabby for Rachel.
So, what? That's it?
Well, yeah! We're cool. Totally cool.
Oh, thanks. Oh, you're the best.
Oh no, you're the best.
Ohh, I gotta go to the flower store! Check it out, no one will tell me where Emily is, so I'm gonna send 72 long-stem, red roses to Emily's parent's house, one for each day that I've known and loved her. That oughta get her talking to me again.
Oh, Ross, when you make out card; be sure to make it out to, EM-I-LY.
Rach, that's great! It's so good that you had a good time in Greece!
What?! I didn't have a good time in Greece! Ross abandoned me! Okay, I couldn't get a plane out, so I had to stay in their honeymoon suite with people coming up to me all the time going, "Oh, Mrs. Geller, why are you crying?" I mean, it was sooo humiliating. I felt like such an idiot! I mean, it's all my fault! And you know why, because I make very bad decisions.
Oh that's not true.
Yes it is! It is true! I went, I went after Ross in stupid London.
London is stupid! Stupid!
Phoebe, you were right. I should've never gone to London, and from now on you make all of my decisions for me.
Oh... No, I did that for someone once and I'm not comfortable having that kind of power and control over someone's life.
I'll do it!
That's fine. So Monica, you are now in control of my love life.
Okay, I gotta go to work.
And uh, Rachel, glad to have you back.
Pheebs! Always a pleasure.
Oh, Rachel, sweetie, look, here's a really cute picture of Joey and you at the reception.
Ohh, he's married! Ross is married. I can't-I still can't believe it.
Honey, sweetie, by the edges.
I mean, y'know I'm just gonna have to accept it ...
Ohh.
...I mean it's my fault.
Sweetie! Edges! Fingers! Smudgey! Pictures!
Oh my God!
Okay. That's okay. I-I know that you're very upset right now. I know, I know that wasn't about me.
I bet it was about her a little.
If you would stop thinking about Ross for one minute you would notice that there are great guys everywhere! I mean, look! Look, Gunther! I mean, he's nice, he's cute.
Yeah, I guess Gunther is kinda...
Oh, what about that guy over there? Remember? That is the guy you flirted with at the counter that time.
Oh, I don't know. I don't know.
You're going to talk to him! Y'know what? We made a deal, I make your decisions and I say you're going to talk to him.
All right, you're the boss. I guess I gotta do what you tell me.
Say that to him and you're golden.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey, Pheebs!
We got out pictures back from London. Here's all of us at the Tower of London.
Oh! Here we all are! Yeah, there's Ross and Joey and you and me.
All right, y'know what, we've been talking about London too much haven't we?
No. I'm sorry. It's just 'cause I couldn't be there. 'Cause all I ever get to do now is pregnant stuff, it just bums me out.
Sorry.
What happened?
Well, y'know, a little of this, a little of that. Got myself a date tomorrow night.
See, didn't I tell you?! You're getting over Ross already!
Well...
Get out!
What took you so long?
I got caught up and work, but I'm quitting tomorrow.
Oh, good.
So, thanks for having me over! Rach. Pheebs.
See ya!! What the hell was that?!
Probably some y'know, European good-bye thing he picked up in London.
That's not European!
Well, it felt French.
Oh God, I really had a good time!
Yeah, me too. So, I guess this is it.
Yeah. Umm, unless you wanna come inside?
Yeah!
Okay. Oh, uh, wait a minute, y'know what? I uh, I can't decide this. Umm, okay, just hold on a second.
Okay, yeah!
Umm, hi!
Hi.
Is Monica around? I-I have to ask her something.
She's doing her laundry.
What's that?
It came in the mail today, it's uh, 72 long-stemmed red roses, one for each day that I've known and loved Emily, cut up into mulch!
Oh, honey that's awful.
Oh, it's not so bad. Monica's gonna make potpourri! I think I'm gonna go wander out in the rain for a while.
But, it's not raining.
I can't catch a break!
Y'know what Ross? You're not going anywhere. You're gonna sit right here. I'm gonna make you a cup of tea and we're gonna talk this thing whole out. All right? Hey, Dave!
Yeah?
Umm, listen, I'm gonna need to take a rain check, my roommate is just really sick. Okay? Bye! Honey, listen, I know, I know things seem so bad right now.
Rach? Can I talk to for just a minute? I-I dropped some socks.
Yeah.
What is the matter with you?! Do you want to fall into the trap? Do you want to fall into the trap?!
Ohh! You did not drop any socks!
I just ran into Dave and he told me that you blew him off! I mean, you listen to me! Now, I'm calling the shots! I say you leave Ross alone and go get Dave! What the hell were you trying to do?
Well, ultimately, I was trying y'know, I-I wanted...tell him y'know, that I'm still in love with him.
What?!! You cannot tell him that!!
Why? Why not?! People love to hear that!
I make the decisions, and I say no.
Well, y'know what, no, you do not make my decisions because y'know what, you're fired.
You can't fire me. I make your decisions and I say, "I'm not fired!" Ha!
Well...
Rachel!! Come on! Let me in!
Havin' some trouble?
Rachel locked the door.
I'll kick that door in if you give me a little sugar.
Rachel! Let me in! Rachel!
Thank you. Rachel, can I talk to you outside for a sec?
No.
I really need to talk to you.
Well, then talk!
Okay, I will. Remember that thing that we just discussed that you wanted to do?
Yes!
What thing?
Well, Rachel wants to take swing dance lessons. Which I think is a really stupid idea! It's dangerous, she's never gonna get what she wants, and who knows who she might end up hurting.
Monica's right, swing dancing can be tricky. I'm gonna use the phone. I gotta cancel those five giant teddy bears I sent to Emily. My God, think of the massacre.
I'm gonna do it.
All right, Rachel, I know-I know you think I'm crazy, please, before you tell him you love him, just-just try to find one person who thinks this is a good idea. Because I bet you, you can't.
But I...
Please!
All right, fine.
Joey, I'm in!
All right. Good deal.
Pheebs! Hey Pheebs!
Uh, okay, Pheebs?
Yeah?
Umm, y'know how the other day you were talking about how you didn't get to go to London and how you were kinda feeling left out?
Yeah?
All right, well, we felt really bad about that so we decided we should all take a little trip together!
Ohh, that's so nice! How great! Well, where? Where's the trip?!
Well, we thought we would all go to a picnic , in Central Park!
Central... Park!
Yeah, all of us! All day!
That sucks! That's not a trip! I just came from the park! What are we gonna high five about at the stupid Central Park? "Well, it's right by my house, all right!"
Well, I'm gonna go home and bask in the triumph of my Central Park idea.
Hey-whoa-whoa-whoa!! Ho-ho-hold on a sec there, Mr. Kissey! Y'know, I've been meaning to talk to you about this whole, little, new European thing you got going on, and I just need to tell you that it makes me very uncomfortable and I just-y'know-stop it!
I was just trying to bring a little culture to the group.
That's fine, just don't bring it in my mouth.
Makes me wanna puke!
Hey everybody, Pheebs is here!
Phoebe!
Hey, Pheebs!
Phoebe, woo!
Okay, woo! Hi.
Okay, Pheebs, we decided the picnic idea was a little... Y'know, it didn't have any... It-it, well it blew. So, we thought, that this afternoon that we would all go away for the whole weekend to, Atlantic City!
Ooh, Atlantic City! Oh, that's a great plan! Who's plan was that?
Mine!
Wait! It was my plan.
Nooo, I said we needed a new plan.
And, I came up with Atlantic City.
Which, is the new plan!
Okay, well, why don't we all meet upstairs in an hour?
Okay! Ooh-ahh, I'm gonna go pack. I'm gonna go pack my ass off!
Come on Rach, let's go.
Yeah, y'know what? I'm-I'm gonna meet you upstairs in a minute.
No! Rachel, you didn't find anyone so you can't tell him.
Well, y'know what, that doesn't matter.
Okay, Rachel, do you have any idea how painful it is to tell someone that you love them and not have them say it back?
Yeah, I-I don't care.
Okay. I-I can't watch.
What 'cha readin'?
The paper.
Yeah, what's it about?
Events from around the globe.
Okay. Uhh, Ross, y'know what, there's something that I-that I have to talk to you about and everybody's saying that I shouldn't tell you, but I think they're wrong. I mean, and you know how people can be wrong.
Sure. Once, at work I-I thought carbon dating was fossilized...
Okay, Ross, I'm really trying to tell you something here.
Yeah.
Okay.
Go ahead.
Umm, okay, I think I'm-I'm just gonna-just gonna say it. Just gonna say it. Uhh, I'm still in love with you Ross.
Wow. Umm... Huh... I'm-I'm not sure what to do with that right now.
What? What? Was that a joke? 'Cause it's mean.
I'm so dead serious. I'm totally serious.
Why are you laughing?
Because , because, I just heard it. I heard it, and it's ridiculous! I mean, you're married. You're-you're married and it's just ridiculous, and it's like, it's like when said it, I sort of like, I floated up out of my body, y'know? And, and-and then I heard myself say it and then the floating Rachel was like, "You are such an idiot!"
Well, well I am married. Even though I haven't spoken to my wife since the wedding.
I'm sorry, that's not funny.
Actually, it kinda is. My wife won't return my calls. I don't know where my wife is. "Hey Ross, where's the Mrs.?" Don't know!
Oh God, ohh, okay, y'know what, do you think ah, do you think that you just forget that I told you this?
Well, I kinda half to. I mean, because the thing is...
The thing is y'know, that you're married to Emily.
That is what the thing is.
Ross, things aren't gonna be weird between us, right? I mean was that just the stupidest thing, me telling you that?
No. No. No, I'm-I'm glad you did. Look, if nothing else, it's-it's always great when someone tells you they love you.
That's what I said! Thank you for being so nice.
No thank you for... Thank you.
Okay, let's go!
Atlantic City!
Atlantic City, baby! Let's roll some bones! Hey Joey, high-five for rolling bones!
Uh, Pheebs, you're leaking?
Oh my God! You're water broke!
Ohh!
All right. Well, don't worry, I call shotgun!
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Wait-wait!
Pheebs! We have to take you to the hospital now!
Pheebs, Pheebs, the babies are coming now.
High-five, the babies are coming!
Wait, wait, remember when my water broke?
I can't believe Phoebe's gonna have her babies!
I know, it's beautiful. Amazing.
Y'know what else I can't believe? I had to kiss Phoebe and Rachel every time I left a room, I mean it's too bad they didn't see us having sex.
Do you know anything about women?
No.
That's all right.
Okay.
Hi.
Hi.
Hi, yeah, hi! I'm umm, Phoebe Buffay, and I have babies coming out of me.
Okay. Have you started having contractions?
Not yet. Umm, I heard they really hurt, do they hurt?
Well...
Oh my God!
It's all right.
Now, which of you is the father?
Oh no, none of them are the father. The father is my brother.
Okay...
I am so gonna miss watching you freak people out like that!
Okay, uh Pheebs, quick. Look! This is for the babies to look at someday, so is-is there anything you want to say? Y'know before it all starts?
Oh, okay, umm, hi kids! Um, it's me, Aunt Phoebe. I can't wait to see you. Please don't hurt me!
Hey, what took you guys so long? Your cab left when ours did!
Well, we-we had to go back because I forget my jacket.
That's right.
You-you're not wearing a jacket.
Oh man! I did it again!
Okay, so umm, somebody has to call Frank and Alice. And then my mom wants to know--Joey, what are you doing?!
I gotta get the before shot!
Hi, Pheebs? Okay, so just spoke to the nurse and the reason that your doctor is late is because uh, she's not coming.
What?!
Apparently she fell in the shower and hit her head.
Oh my God, she's so stupid!
Look, Pheebs-Pheebs, it's gonna be okay.
That's easy for you to say, I don't see three kids coming out your vagina!
Honey, listen, y'know what? The nurse said the doctor is wonderful.
Yeah, he's head of the department.
All right-Ooh! Oh dead God, save me!
What?
I'm having my first contraction!
Oh no.
Ooh, it's not bad.
Okay.
Oh! And so the miracle of life begins, and aaiiyyyeeee!
Hey! You okay?
Ooh, something hurts!
Ooh, it's sympathy pains. Ohh, that's so sweet!
Are they? I didn't know I cared that much.
Hello.
Hi! Phoebe, I'm Dr. Harad, I'm going to be delivering your babies. I want you to know, you're gonna be in good hands. I've been doing this for a long time. I'll be back in a minute to do your internal, in the meantime, just relax because everything here looks great. And also, I love Fonzie.
Did he just say, he loves Fonzie?
That's what it sounded like.
All right...
Hey!
Hey!
Hey! Am I late? Am I late? Nobody came out yet, right?
No-no-no! We haven't started yet. Where's Alice?
Uh, Delaware. She's on her way though, so until she gets here, I'm gonna be your coach. But don't worry, she told me all about the la-Mazada stuff.
Yeah, that's when if you get the babies out by the end of the month, they give you 2% financing.
Yeah.
Monica? You gonna be very proud of me. I just got us dates with two unbelievably cute nurses.
Oh my!
They're male nurses.
Not in my head.
Anyway, they want to take us out Saturday night! What do you say?
Umm. Umm. Umm. I don't think so.
What? What are you talking about?! You-you're the one who's been telling me to get over Ross and move on. I'm moving on, and you're moving on with me. Come on, give me one good reason why you don't wanna go.
Umm, why don't you give me something that would be a good reason and-and then I'll tell you if it's true.
What?
Harder than it sounds. Isn't it?
Okay, you're coming with me, and I also told them that if we're still here when they get off that we'll go down to the cafeteria and have some Jell-O with them.
Yep! There's always room for Jell-O...
Joey, how do you make that dirty?
Oh, it's easy. Yeah, I-I can do it with anything. Watch uh, Grandma's chicken salad...
Ross! Get a shot of this. Hey babies! These are the headlines on the day you were born! Okay, now girl baby turn away and boy babies... Check it out, huh?! This is what naked women looked like the month you were born. All right, now let's dive right into the good stuff.
Oh, okay, I'm having another one! This one doesn't hurt either-Ooh, yes it does! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ooh! Oh, I was kinda hoping that was it.
Hey, where are Monica and Rachel anyway?
Oh, a couple of nurses asked them out. Maybe they're with them.
Really? Male nurses?
Yeah, I was bummed too.
So they're going on dates? When?
I think Saturday-.
What's with him?
Umm, sympathy pains. I thought it was really sweet at first, but now I think he's just trying to steal my thunder.
Okay!
Hey.
Let's see what we got here. Ohh, y'know, Fonzie dated triplets.
This-this Fonzie person you keep referring too, is that uh, is that another doctor?
Oh no-no-no. Fonzie is the nickname of Arthur Fonzerelli. The Fonz.
All right.
It's not that weird, is it?
It's very weird! I don't want some guy down there telling me, I'm y'know, dilatedamundo!
To be fair, he doesn't seem to be impersonating Fonzie...
What are you doing?!! Why are you defending him?! Just get me another doctor! One who is not crazy and who is not Fonzie!
Again, it's not that he...
Oh-hey-hey-hey! There you are!
Umm, listen there's something I think you should know.
Oh, is this about you-you dating the nurse? Yeah, Joey already told me, and I am so-so fine. I mean, you and I we're just, y'know, we're nothing, we're goofin' around.
Umm, actually I was about to tell you that I was, I was going to get out of it, but hey, if we're just goofing around then uh, maybe I will go out with him.
Fine! Maybe I will too!
Hey, you guys! Look what I found in the giiiiiiift shop. Get up! Get up! Get up!
Okay, Phoebe, this Dr. Oberman. He has no strong feelings about Fonzie or any of the Happy Days gang.
Hi! And you're going into what grade?
Umm, I'm actually a first year resident, but I get that a lot, you see, I-I graduated early...
Uh-huh, me too. Ross, maybe I should've specified that I'd be needing a grown up doctor.
Oh no, I'm fully qualified to...
Shh! Doogie, shh! Doesn't anybody understand that I'm gonna be having babies soon? Huh? Go! Go little boy, go!
Oh cool! You made him cry!
Mr. Tribbiani, I'm afraid you've got kidney stones.
Umm, well, what else could it be?
It's kidney stones.
Or?
Kidney stones!
All right, you're getting there. Oh, and y'know, these babies are very, very lucky.
They are. Why?
They have the honor of being born on The Fonz's half-birthday.
Happy birthday!
Just-just to clarify, I'm not Fonzie.
Honey, y'know I just gotta tell you, I think this is such a terrific thing you're having these babies for Frank and Alice.
I know, it is.
Yeah!
Can I tell you a little secret?
Yeah!
I want to keep one.
Ohh, I'm gonna be on the news!
Okay, Phoebe, honey, you gotta be kidding. I mean, you know you cannot keep one of these babies!
Why not?! Maybe I can, you don't know!
Yes! Yes! Yes, I do! I do know! Frank and Alice are gonna want to keep all of their children!
Maybe not! Y'know? Seriously, three babies are a handful maybe they're y'know, looking for a chance to unload one of them. Listen, I-I hate to miss an opportunity just because I didn't ask! Y'know?
Phoebe, no! This is, this is insane.
Oh, just ask him!
Me?!
I can't ask him! Do you have any idea how inappropriate that would be?! All I'm saying is just talk to Frank. Okay? Just, y'know, feel him out!
No! Forget it! I am not gonna ask Frank to give you one of his kids!!
You're right.
Tell him it's for you.
Feeling a little better sweetie?
Well, maybe a little. I wish you hadn't seen me throw up.
Me too.
Hey! I just heard. What's up?
Kidney stones! Now, ordinarily Mr. Tribbiani, we try to break up the stones up with shock waves, but they're to close to the bladder now. Which means we can either wait for you to pass them or else go up the urethra...
Whoa-whoa! No-no-no-no-no, nothing is going up! Okay? Up, up is not an option-what's a urethra? Are you crazy?!
So did you ask him?
No, I haven't had a chance to be alone with him yet.
Well, I'm kinda on a clock here.
Oh Fonzie.
Y'know who I always liked? Mork.
Undo it. Undo it. Undo it.
Fonzie met Mork. Mork froze Fonzie.
Yeah, but umm... Yes, but, Fonzie was already cool, so he wasn't hurt, right?
Yeah, that's right.
Hey!
Hi!
How are you doing?
Okay, doctor says any minute now.
Hey, y'know, Alice is gonna be here so soon, you couldn't just like do me a favor and like, like hold them in?
Sorry Frank, I'm kinda in the middle of the last favor you asked me to do.
Hey!
Hi!
Rachel.
Monica, this is Dan , one of the guys that we're gonna be going out with on Saturday. Uh Dan, Monica.
Nice to meet you.
Hello Dan! I'm really looking forward to Saturday night! Really, really!
So Dan, nurse not a doctor huh? Kinda girlie isn't it?
Chandler!
Nah that's okay. I'm just doing this to put myself through medical school.
Oh.
And it didn't feel so girlie during the Gulf War.
Sure. And listen, thanks for doing that for us, by the way.
So, why wait 'til Saturday, are you free tomorrow?
Sure! I'll get somebody to cover my shift.
Oh, great!
Hey, how 'bout it? You, me, Saturday night?
No.
All right. Very good.
Oo, this is a big one. Eww! Arghhhh!!
Ohh, get these things out of me!
Breathe! Breathe! Breathe throw the pain.
I want the drugs Ross, I want the drugs!
I do too! I do too!
Argh!
Argh!
Argh!
Argh!
Yeah, I love you. Okay, bye! Hi!
Hi!
That was Alice's mom, she said she left five hours ago. She should be here by now!
Oh, honey, don't worry. She's gonna make it on time.
Yeah.
Yeah. So Frank, three babies. Whew, that just seems like a lot, huh?
Not to me.
Yeah, fair enough.
Okay, you're at ten centimeters. Time to start having some babies. All right, I want only the father in here please.
Bye Dan!
Uh, bye Monica.
Bye, momi-moo.
All right, I need a clamp, sterile towel, and channel 31.
What is that?
Oh my God!
Oh, no-no-no, it's a good one! Fonzie plays the bongos. All right, are you ready? It's time to start pushing.
Are you ready? It's time to try peeing. Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait! It's almost time to try peeing.
Okay, now push! That's it push! Just concentrate on pushing! Yeah, here we go!
I see the head.
Yes, it has a head!
All right. Keep pushing! Come on!
I can't believe there's somebody coming out of you right now. There's somebody coming out of you! Is it? Is it? It's my son.
All right. Here's your first baby.
YESSSSS!!!!! We got a baby boy!!
Yes!
Frank Jr. Jr.!!
Oh, how does he look? How does he look?
So gross!
Okay. You ready to push again?
I already had a baby. Leave me alone.
Okay, okay, come on, you can do it. You can do it!
Yeah!! Little Leslie is here! We got another one! Oh my God, I can't believe I have two-two children. How scary is that?
Come on little Chandler, it's time to be born. Come on little Chandler! Come on!
All right, he's coming. He's coming!
Hey, where's his thing?
Chandler's a girl!
Oh God, kindergarten flashback.
They musta read the sonogram wrong. 'Cause they, 'cause they thought it was a boy, but Chandler's a girl! Chandler's a girl!
Okay, keep saying it!
Am I too late?!
No-no ah, everything's okay. Everybody's healthy there's 30 fingers and 30 toes.
We have our babies?
Yeah.
Oh, we have our babies.
Oh my God.
You did it, man.
Would you like to see them?
They're so small!
So, I'll call you tomorrow.
Great!
So, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?
Well uh, you and I are just goofing around, I thought, why not goof around with him.
Y'know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary... Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together. But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary. I am so bad at this.
I think you're better than you think you are.
Really? Okay, so...
Know when to stop.
Y'know, I sensed that I should stop. So we're okay?
Yeah. All right, I'm gonna go tell Dan that it's not gonna happen. Don't do the dance.
Right!
I think you're my favorite.
Which one do you have?
I don't care.
Hi. Hey, hi! So uh, Frank and Alice wanted me to tell you that they're still outside making phone calls.
But umm, I mean, did you talk to them about, y'know...
Yeah, umm, no honey.
Oh. It was a long shot. Hey, you guys can I just like have a second alone with the babies.
Yeah, sure yeah. Yeah.
So, here you are. It seems like yesterday I was talking to you in that little petri dish. Everyone said labor was the hardest thing I'd ever have to do, but they were wrong this is. Oh, I had the most fun with you guys! I wish I could take you home and see you everyday. Okay, I'll settle for being your favorite Aunt. I know Alice's sister has a pool, but you lived in me. Okay, so we're cool. Yeah, we're gonna be great. Little high fives! Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! Well, if you're gonna cry.
Phoebe, we are so proud of you! You're amazing!
I know.
So does it really hurt as bad as they say?
Yeah. You won't be able to take it.
So uh, now that little Chandler turned out to be a girl, what are they gonna name her?
They're gonna call her Chandler.
That's kind of a masculine name, don't you think?
Works on you.
Come in. I've been waiting for you.
Hi! I just wanna--Ahhh!!! Oh my God! Oh my God!
Okay, I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I-I-I was um, I was taking a nap.
Since when do take naps in that position. Oh God Monica, tell me you were waiting for a guy! Please tell me you were waiting for a guy!
Yes. Yes, I was. A guy. From work. I'm seeing a guy from work! Ha!
That cute waiter guy from your restaurant, the one that looks like a non-threatening Ray Liotta?
Uh-huh, that one!
Y'know what, just give me a second and I'll be out of your hair. I'm just gonna grab a jacket. When I get back, I want every little detail. Maybe that's him.
Okay, umm, okay, umm... It's just Joey and Ross.
Why aren't you guys at the movie?
Well, we were! But Ross was talking so loud on his phone they threw us out!
I had to talk loud because the movie was loud!
He's talking to London!
But why?! Did he get in touch with Emily?
Well no, not yet. He's calling everyone on her side of the family hoping that someone will help him get in touch with her.
I-I-I don't care if I said some other girl's name you prissy, old twit!
Ross! Way to suck up to the family.
Ha-ha-ha--enh-enh. I'm so glad you guys are all here! My office finally got wrinkle free fax paper!
Hey!
Oh no-no-no-no-no-no, vomit tux! No-no, vomit tux!
Don't worry, I had it dry-cleaned.
Vomit tux? Who vomited on-y'know what, what you up to Joe?
Well, I'm doing this telethon thing on TV and my agent got me a job as co-host!
Oh that's great!
A little uh, good deed for PBS and a little TV exposure, now that's the kind of math Joey likes to do!
Ugh, PBS!
What's wrong with PBS?
Ugh, what's right with them?
Why don't you like PBS, Pheebs?
Okay, 'cause right after my mom killed herself, I was just in this really bad place, y'know personally. So, I just thought that it'd make me feel better if I wrote to Sesame Street, 'cause they were so nice when I was a little kid! No one ever wrote back.
Well y'know a lot of those Muppets don't have thumbs.
All I got was a lousy key chain! And by that time I was living in a box. I didn't have keys!
I'm sorry Pheebs, I just, y'know, I just wanted to do a good deed. Like-like you did with the babies.
This isn't a good deed, you just wanted to get on TV! This is totally selfish.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What about you, having those babies for your brother? Talk about selfish!
What-what are you talking about?!
Well, yeah, it was a really nice thing and all, but it made you feel really good right?
Yeah. So?
It made you feel good, so that makes it selfish. Look, there's no unselfish good deeds, sorry.
Yes there are! There are totally good deeds that are selfless.
Well, may I ask for one example?
Yeah, it's... Y'know there's-no you may not!
That's because all people are selfish.
Are you calling me selfish?!
Are you calling you people? Yeah, well sorry to burst that bubble, Pheebs, but selfless good deeds don't exist. Okay? And you the deal on Santa Clause right?
I'm gonna find a selfless good dead. I'm gonna beat you, you evil genius.
Hello.
Hello, Ross?
Emily? Emily! Oh my God! Oh my God, it's Emily! It's Emily everyone! Shush-shush-shhst! Hi!
Ross, I'm only ringing to say stop harassing my relatives. Good-bye!
No wait! Look, wait! Okay, you can hang up, but I'm gonna keep calling! I'm gonna, I'm gonna call everyone in England if that's what it takes to get you to talk to me!
Really? About what?
Look you're my wife. We're-we're married. Y'know? I-I love you. I-I really miss you.
I miss you to. Well, at least I think I do.
She's talking.
Yay!
Hey, Joey, when you said the deal with Santa Clause, you meant?
That he doesn't exist.
Right.
So Chandler, have you heard about Monica's secret boyfriend?
Uhh, yeah. She uh, she uh, she uh might've mentioned him.
So Mon, when are we gonna meet this new secret waiter man?
Ohh, he's really shy. I-I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.
Yeah, I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.
I don't care! I wanna meet this guy who's the best sex she ever had!
Really?! That's what you heard? You said that?
I might've said that. Why is that funny?
Because I'm very happy for him! And you, you lucky dog!
Hi!
Hey!
Well, Emily's willing to work on the relationship.
Yes!
That's great!
In London!
What?!
She wants me to move to London.
But you live here! You know that.
What-what-what are you gonna do?
I bet if I talk to Carol and Susan I can convince them to move to London with Ben.
Yeah, I'm sure your ex-wife will be more than happy to move to another country so you can patch things up with your new wife.
It could happen.
How ya doin'? Welcome. Good to see ya!
This will be your phone.
That's great. But uh, I'm not really expecting a lot of calls.
No you answer it and take pledges.
But I'm the host!
No, Gary Collins is the host. You'll be answering the phones.
You don't seem to understand. See, I was Dr. Drake Remoray.
Well, here's your phone doctor.
I cannot believe I can't find a selfless good deed! Y'know that old guy that lives next to me? Well, I snuck over there and-and raked up all the leaves on his front stoop. But he caught me and force-fed me cider and cookies. Then I felt wonderful. That old jackass!
Maybe Joey's right. Maybe all good deeds are selfish.
I will find a selfless good deed! 'Cause I just gave birth to three children and I will not let them be raised in a world where Joey is right!
Hey, Monica? Can I ask you a cooking question?
Sure!
If you're cooking on the stove, does that mean that your new secret boyfriend is better in bed than Richard?
Chandler! Is he?
Well, y'know I-I-I think I'm gonna respect the privacy of my new secret boyfriend.
Why?! I mean if this guy was me and it was me who had learned that it was me who was the best you'd ever had, I'd be going like this.
All right Emily, as much as I love you, I'm sorry, I can't move to London without Ben.
I understand that would be difficult.
Yeah, would you please consider moving here? I mean you were gonna move here anyway, why can't you just do that?
I don't know, it's just...
Oh-oh-okay, but-but I know, that even though I've been a-a complete idiot up 'til now, I mean, I mean you-you-you have to come here. You have to come here so we can work this out.
All right.
All right, did you just say all right?
I did. Now I'm the idiot.
Oh, Emily that is, that is so great. It's gonna be so great! We're gonna be like-like-like two idiots in love!
Ross, there's one thing that really scares me still.
Yes, tell me.
Well, you have to understand how humiliating it was for me up on that altar in front of my entire family, all my friends.
I know. I am, I am so sorry.
And then after decided to forgive you, seeing you at the airport catching our plane with her.
Again, very sorry.
I mean, I can't-I can't be in the same room as her! It drives me mad just thinking of you being in the same room as her!
Emily, there is nothing between Rachel and me. Okay? I love you.
All right. I'll come to New York and we'll try and make this work.
Oh that is so great! That's...
As long as you don't see Rachel anymore.
So I asked Emily if she would come to New York, and she said yes.
Yes!
Ooh-ohh!
Great!
No-no-no! Only if I promise never to see Rachel again.
Why?
What?! You can't-what did you tell her?
I told her I'd have to think about it. I mean, how the hell am I supposed to make this kind of a decision? I'm actually asking you!
Well, you can't just not see Rachel anymore, she's one of your best friends.
Yeah! But, he can't not exactly see Emily, I mean that's his wife.
Yeah.
That's true!
Yeah, but you've known Rachel since High School and you cannot just cut her out of your life.
That's true!
No, you cannot.
Thanks for the help, problem solved.
Hello.
Hey Mon!
Oh hey Joey! We've been watching all day, when are you gonna be on TV?
See, there was kind of a mix up in my agent's office, but I'm still on TV and that's good exposure.
You're not on TV.
Oh, uh, okay, how, how about now?
Hey, there he is! There he is!
Hello New York!
Now maybe you just like wanna but the whole duck in there! Who cares, y'know? Now I got the legs...
How many times have I told you guys, you never watch the cooking channel!
Hi Chandler.
Hey!
Uh, listen, I need that broiling pan that Joey borrowed the other day.
Oh that was yours? Uh, yeah, we used it when the duck was throwing up caterpillars.
William Sonoma, fall catalog, Page 27.
Expect it in 4-6 weeks. Umm, hey, umm, Joey's gonna be at the telethon for the rest of the day, we have the whole place to ourselves.
Yeah, so?
Well I just, thought maybe you'd wanna book some time with the best you'd ever had.
Y'know what, champ? I think I'll pass.
Why?
Why?
What's your point?
PBS telethon.
Hey Joey, I just wanted to let you know that I found a selfless good deed. I just went down to the park and I let a bee sting me.
What?! What good is that gonna do anybody?
Well, it helps the bee look tough in front of his bee friends. The bee is happy and I am definitely not.
Now, y'know the bee probably died after he stung ya.
Aw, dammit!
Back on in 30 seconds people!
Hey, excuse me, would you mind switching with me?
Hey, no way, I'm in the shot man.
Come on man! You've been here all day!
Yeah, I-I'm taking pledges here, eh?
We're on in 3, 2,
Welcome back to our fall telethon. Now if you've been enjoying the performance of Cirque Du Soleil, and you'd like to see more of the same kind of programming, it's very simple. All you have to do is call in your pledge and at that time tell the operator, one of our volunteers, what kind of programming you'd like to...
Okay, that's it. I cannot make this decision! It is too difficult, so I'm just gonna leave it entirely to the gods of fate.
A Magic Eight ball?! You can't be serious, you can't make this decision with a toy!
Ooh, it's not a toy.
Well, I don't know what else to do. I mean, I either keep my wife and lose one of my-my-my best friends or I keep my friend and get divorced the second time before I'm 30! So-so if anyone has-has a better suggestion, let's hear it! 'Cause I-I got nothing! All right, don't be shy, any suggestion will do. Okay then. Here we go. Magic 8 Ball, should I never see Rachel again? Ask again later. Later is not good enough. Ask again later. What the hell! This is broken! It-it is broken!
All right, let me see. Will Chandler have sex tonight? Don't count on it. Seems like it works to me.
PBS Telethon.
Hi Joey.
Hey Pheebs!
I would like to make a pledge. I would like to donate $200.
$200? Are you sure Pheebs? I mean, after what Sesame Street did to ya?
Oh, I'm still mad at them but I also now that they bring happiness to lots of kids who's moms didn't kill themselves, so by supporting them, I'm doing a good thing, but I'm not happy about it. So there, a selfless good deed.
And you don't a little good about donating the money?
No, it sucks. I was saving up to buy a hamster.
A hamster? What, those things are like 10 bucks.
Yeah, not the one I had my eye on.
It looks like we have surpassed last year's pledge total! Thank you viewers! The pledge that did it was taken by one of our volunteers... Oh boy! And may I say one of our sharpest dressed volunteers, Mr. Joseph Tribbiani!
Oh, look-look, Joey's on TV! Isn't that great? My pledge got Joey on TV! Oh that makes me feel-Oh no!
Look, maybe I got carried away before. But there's something you gotta know. If I'm the best, it's only because you've made me the best.
Keep talking.
I mean I was nothing before you. Call the other girls and ask. Which wouldn't take long. But when I'm with you, and we're together, OH...MY...GOD.
Really?
Oh-aw my God! Now, I understand if you never want to sleep with me again, but that would be wrong. We're too good! We owe it, to sex!
Well, if we owe it? Oh my... When is Joey gonna be home?
Well, I was kinda hoping we could do this without him. Oh no-no-no, leave the gloves on.
But, I just cleaned the bathroom.
Yeah, why don't we lose the gloves.
Yeah.
All right, let's show them how it's done.
Okay.
Ow!
Y'know that wasn't part of it?
I know!
Hi! Are you ready? We're gonna be late!
For what?
For Stella! Remember? She's gettin' her grove back in like 20 minutes.
Yeah, I uh, totally forgot about that. You mind if I take a rain check? I'm waiting for a call from Emily.
Sure. I guess. Hey, I hear you don't have to go to London. Yay!
It's not that easy, there's still a lot of relationship stuff.
Like what?
Just stuff. Y'know kinda what Emily wants.
Well, why don't you talk to me about it, maybe I can help.
No. No. You-you can't help. I mean, I kinda have to do this without your help.
Well, I-I know you can do that too. I'm just, I'm just saying if you need somebody to talk to... Hi!
Thanks.
Ross? Look, whatever this relationship stuff that Emily wants, just give it to her. Come on, the bottom line here is that you love her. So just fix whatever she wants fixed. Just do it. I mean, you're gonna have to try. You'll just gonna hate yourself if you don't. Oh come on answer it! It's driving me crazy!
Hello. Hi sweetie. Good. Look umm, yes I've been thinking about that thing that you wanted me to do and, I can do it. So will you come to New York?
Never done that before.
Nope.
Hi!
Hi!
Monica? What time is it?
Uhh, 9.
But it's dark out.
Well that's because you always sleep to noon, silly! This is what 9 looks like.
I guess I'll get washed up then. Watch that sunrise.
I'm really getting tired of sneaking around.
I know, me too. Hey! Y'know what if we went away for a whole weekend? Y'know we'd have no interruptions and we could be naked the entire time.
All weekend? That's a whole lotta naked.
Yeah, I can say that I have a conference and you can say you have a chef thing.
Ohh, I've always wanted to go to this culinary fair that they have in Jersey!
Okay, y'know your not though. Let's go.
Wait! What about Joey?
Hey, guess what I'm doing this weekend! I'm going to this culinary fair in New Jersey.
Oh weird, Chandler just told us he's got a conference there!
Oh now that-that-that's funny, it seems like Chandler's conference could've been in Connecticut or Vermont.
I'm not in charge of where the conference is held. Do you want people to think it's a fake conference? It's a real conference.
Hey.
Hey!
Hey.
Is Rachel here? I gotta talk to her.
No, she's out shopping.
Damn!
What's going on?
I told Emily to come. And I just need to y'know, talk to Rachel about it.
Wait a minute! So when Emily comes you're just, you're not gonna see Rachel anymore?
Well look, I'm just trying to focus on the "I get to see my wife," part, all right? And not the part that makes me do this.
Wow, so you guys are, you're never gonna be in the same room together? How is that even gonna work?
I have no idea. I mean... But-but I assure you I will figure it out.
Doesn't seem like it's going to work, I mean...
Hi, guys!
Hi!
Uh, hey!
What's going on?
We're flipping Monica's mattress.
So I'm thinking, basically we pick it up and then we flip it.
Yeah that's better than my way.
Oh okay, hey guys, would you flip mine too?
Aww, man!
Oh look! A letter from my mom.
So, Rach, y'know-y'know how Emily's coming right?
Oh yeah! I know.
Can you hear anything?
Oh yes, somebody just said, "Can you hear anything?"
Hey, Joey's ass! What are you doing?
Well, remember when they got in that big fight and broke up and we were all stuck in her with no food or anything? Well, when Ross said Rachel at the wedding, I figured it was gonna happen again, so I hid this in here.
Ooh, candy bars, crossword puzzles...
Ooh, Madlibs, mine!
Condoms?
You don't know how long we're gonna be in here! We may have to repopulate the Earth.
And condoms are the way to do that?
Anyway it-it kinda-it all boils down to this, the last time I talked to Emily...
Oh my God! My dog died!
What?!
Oh my God, Le Poo, our dog!
Le Poo's still alive?!
Oh God, it says he was hit by an ice cream truck and dragged for nine--teen blocks. Oh. Oh my God.
Sweetie, we heard you crying. Please don't cry.
It's Le Poo.
I know it's le poo right now, but it'll get better.
I can't believe it! We're here!
Ooh, chocolates on the pillows! I love that!
Oh, you should live with Joey, Roll-os everywhere.
Come here. Okay, be right back.
Oh yes! Monica, get in here! There's a high-speed car chase on!
We're switching rooms.
Oh dear God, they gave us glasses!
No, they gave us glasses with lipstick on them! I mean, if they didn't change the glasses, who knows what else they didn't change. Come on sweetie, I just want this weekend to be perfect, I mean we can change rooms, can't we?
Okay, but let's do it now though, because Chopper 5 just lost it's feed!
Hey, so uh, y'know how there's something I wanted to talk to you about?
Oh yeah!
Well, y'know how I'm trying to work things out with Emily. Well, there's this one thing... Okay, here goes. I made a promise that--Oh hey!
What?
You're nose is bleeding!
Oh God. No! Oh not again! This-this happened when my grandfather died. It's ugh! Sorry. Oh, okay, so I'm sorry, what-what were you-what did you want to tell me?
Umm...
Sorry. Sorry.
Okay, I uh, I can't see you anymore.
Yeah, I know. It's ridiculous! I can't see you either.
I think you'll find this room more to your liking.
Okay, great.
They say he's only got half a tank left.
Half a tank? We still got a lot of high-speed chasing to do!
We're switching rooms again.
What? Why?
This is a garden view room, and we paid for an ocean view room.
Our last ocean view room was unacceptable to you.
Excuse me, umm, can I talk to you over here for just a second?
Uh-huh.
Chandler!
Yeah.
Look, these clowns are trying to take us for a ride and I'm not gonna let 'em! And we're not a couple of suckers!
I hear ya, Mugsy! But look, all these rooms are fine okay? Can you just pick one so I can watch--have a perfect, magical weekend together with you.
Okay, this one I like!
Nothing! It's over! Dammit! This is regularly scheduled programming!
Can we turn the TV off? Okay? Do we really want to spend the entire weekend like this?
Oh, I'm sorry, am I getting in the way of all the room switching fun?
Hey, don't blame me for wigging tonight!
Oh, who should I blame? The nice bell man who had to drag out luggage to 10 different rooms?
I don't know, how about the idiot who thought he could drive from Albany to Canada on a half a tank of gas!
Do not speak ill of the dead.
We're supposed to uh, be spending a romantic weekend together, it-it, what is the matter with you?
I just want to watch a little television. What is the big deal? Geez, relax mom.
What did you say?
I said, "Geez, relax Monnnnn."
Hi!
Hey. Rachel, I-I-I've been wanting to tell you something for a while now and I really, I just have to get it out.
Okay, what's up?
Okay, y'know how you told me I should do whatever it takes to fix my marriage?
Yeah, I told you to give Emily whatever she wants.
And while that was good advice, you should know that what-what she wants...
Yeah?
...is for me not to see you anymore.
That's crazy! You can't do that! What are you going to tell her? Oh God. Ohh, you already agreed to this, haven't you?
It's awful I know, I mean, I feel terrible but I have to do this if I want my marriage to work. And I do, I have to make this marriage work. I have too. But the good thing is we can still see each other until she gets here.
Ohh! Lucky me! Oh my God! That is good news, Ross! I think that's the best news I've heard since Le Poo died!
You have no idea what a nightmare this has been. This is so hard.
Oh yeah, really? Is it Ross? Yeah? Okay, well let me make this a just a little bit easier for you.
What are you doing?
Storming out!
Rachel, this is your apartment.
Yeah, well that's how mad I am!!
Damn Rollos!
Hey, you're back!
Hey.
How was your conference?
It was terrible. I fought with my colleagues y'know, the entire time. Are you kidding with this?
Oh, so your weekend was a total bust?
Uh, no, I got to see Donald Trump waiting for an elevator.
Hi!
Hey, you're back too!
Yeah. Umm, Chandler can I talk to you outside for a second?
Hey, how was your chef thing?
Oh, it was awful. I guess some people just don't appreciate really good food.
Well, maybe it was the kind of food that tasted good at first but then made everybody vomit and have diarrhea.
Chandler!
Monica.
Okay, I'd like to know how much the room was because I'd like to pay my half.
Okay, fine, $300.
300 dollars?!
Yeah, just think of it as $25 per room!
Urghh!!
What are you guys woofing about?
Chandler stole a twenty from my purse!
Nooooo!!! Y'know what? Now that I think about it, I constantly find myself without twenties and you always have lots!
You should've seen the look on her face. I don't want Rachel to hate me! I don't know what to do.
You want my advice?
Yes! Please!
You're not gonna like it.
That's okay.
You got married to fast.
That's not advice!
I told ya.
I'm going to the bathroom.
Man, if anyone asked me to give up any of you, I couldn't do it.
Yeah, me either.
Maybe I could do it.
Hi!
Hi, Rach.
Hi!
Hey.
Hey.
Look, I know you guys heard about the whole thing with me and Ross but y'know, I've been obsessing about it all day and I'd just love not to talk about it. All right?
I-I-I don't know if this falls under this category, but uh, Ross is right back there.
That's not Ross!
Oh no! Not that guy! He does look like him though.
Okay, Ross is in the bathroom.
Oh my God, its happening. It's already started. I'm Kip.
Hey, you're not Kip!
Do you even know who Kip is?
Who cares? You're Rachel! Who's Kip?
Kip, my old roommate, y'know we all used to hang out together.
Oh, that poor bastard.
See? Yeah, you told me the story. He and Monica dated when they broke up they couldn't even be in the same room together and you all promised that you would stay his friend and what happened? He got phased out!
You're not gonna be phased out!
Well, of course I am! It's not gonna happen to Ross! He's your brother. He's your old college roommate. Ugh, it was just a matter of time before someone had to leave the group. I just always assumed Phoebe would be the one to go.
Ehh!!
Honey, come on! You live far away! You're not related. You lift right out.
Hey!
Hey, Mr. Bing. That uh, hotel you stayed at called. Said someone left an eyelash curler in your room.
Yes that was mine.
'Cause I figured you'd hooked up with some girl and she'd left it there.
Yes that would have made more sense.
Y'know, I-I don't even feel like I know you anymore man! All right, look, I'm just gonna ask you this one time. And whatever you say, I'll believe ya. Were you, or were you not on a gay cruise?!
Phoebe? I'm sorry about the whole lifting out thing. You gotta come with me!
Come where?
Wherever I go. Come on you and me, we'll-we'll start a new group, we're the best ones.
Okay, but try and get Joey too.
Pheebs, you mind if I speak to Rachel alone for a sec?
Oh, sure! Bye Ross! Forever.
Hi.
Hi. What are you doing here? Isn't this against the rules?
I talked to Monica, look, I'm the one who made the choice. I'm the one who's making things change, so I should be the one to y'know, step back.
Oh, Ross...
No, no, it's okay. Really. They're plenty of people who just see their sisters at Thanksgiving and just see their college roommates at reunions and just see Joey at Burger King. So is, is that better?
No, it's not better. I still don't get to see you.
Well, what-what would you do? Rach, if you were me, what-what would you do?
Well, for starters I would've said the right name at my wedding!
I can't believe this is happening.
I know.
I am so sorry.
I know that too.
Hey, Rach? Sorry to interrupt but umm, Phoebe wanted me to talk to you about a trip or something.
Hey!
Hi.
I just came over to drop off...nothing. So that weekend kinda sucked, huh?
Yeah, it did.
So, I guess this is over.
What?
Well, y'know, you and me, it had to end sometime.
Why, exactly?
Because of the weekend, we had a fight.
Chandler that's crazy! If you give up every time you'd have a fight with someone you'd never be with anyone longer than-Ohhh!
So, this isn't over?
You are so cute! No. No, it was a fight. You deal with it and move on! It's nothing to freak out about.
Really? Okay. Great!
Ohh, welcome to an adult relationship!
We're in a relationship?
I'm afraid so.
Okay.
Hey!
Hey!
Oh hey, Monica, I heard you saw Donald Trump at your convention.
Yeah, I saw him waiting for an elevator.
Hey, Rach, can I borrow your eyelash curler, I think I lost mine.
Yeah, it's in there.
Oh! Ohh! Oh!!
Joey, can I talk to you for a second?
Oohh!! Ohh! Oh-oh-oh! Oh-oh!!
Ohhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!
Yes. Yes.
You?! And-and you?!
Yes, but you cannot tell anyone! No one knows!
How?! When?!
It happened in London.
IN LONDON!!!
The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.
But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone!
No-no-no-no-no! You can't!
Please? Please?! We just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay? Just promise you won't tell.
All right! Man, this is unbelievable! I mean, it's great, but...
I know, it's great!
Aww, I don't want to see that!
We're so stupid! Do you know what's going on in there? They're trying to take Joey!
The most popular Phoebe in tennis is called the overhand Phoebe. And if you win, you must slap your opponent on the Phoebe and say, "Hi, Phoebe!"
Oh that's cute! We really all enjoyed it. But y'know, it doesn't count.
Count for what?
Count in our heads as-as good Madlibs.
I guess I'm done.
Fun's over!
Wait-wait, guys! If-if we follow the rules, it's still fun and it means something!
Uh-huh!
I think I'm gonna take-off.
Guys, rules are good! Rules help control the fun! Ohhh!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!! None of that, not while you're living under my roof!
What?!
Look, just because I know about you two, doesn't mean I like looking at it.
Aren't you supposed to be at an audition for another hour?
Well, I'm sorry if I'm not a middle-aged black woman! And I'm also sorry if sometimes I go to the wrong audition! Okay, look, if I have to pretend I don't know about you two, then you two are gonna have to pretend there's nothing to know about.
Okay.
Sorry.
Sorry.
I can hear that!
Rachel's at work.
I can still hear you!
Hey!
Hey!
Hello!
Hey, what's that?
Yeah, my mom sent me a family heirloom that once belonged to my grandmother. Can you believe it?! A year ago I didn't even have a family, and now I have heirlooms for crying out loud.
Eeeee--ohh!! God!
Argh-argh!! Ooh, soft. Is this mink?
Yeah! Why would my mother send me a fur? Doesn't she know me but at all! Plus, I have a perfectly fine coat that no innocent animal suffered to make!
Yeah, just some 9-year-old Filipino kids who worked their fingers bloody for 12 cents an hour. That didn't happen, I made that up!
Hey!
Oh, Ross? Ross! You can't put up flyers in here.
How come? Everybody else does.
You can't.
What is that?
Oh, umm, I'm just getting rid of a couple of things.
This is all of your things.
Yes, yes it is! No, but it's good it's-Emily thinks we should get all new stuff. Stuff that's just ours, together. Y'know brand new.
So basically, this is a getting-rid-of-everything-Rachel-ever-used sale.
Touched. Used. Sat on. Sleep on.
I'll take it all.
Hey, Ross, you're okay with that?
Look, if I can just do what Emily wants and get her to New York, I'm sure everything will be fine.
Okay, but don't you think this is a little extreme?
After what I did? Can you blame her?
Oh my God! You got off easy! When my friend Silvie's husband said someone else's name in bed, she cursed him and turned his thingy green.
What is he doing? What, Emily, thinks Ross's furniture has got Rachel coodies?
Now calm down Joey.
No! Everything's gettin' all messed up, y'know? Emily won't let Ross see Rachel, we're not gonna stop seeing Rachel, hence Ross stops seeing us!
Oh, I hate this. Everything's changing.
Yeah I know, we're losing Ross, Joey said hence...
Look, I'm not happy about this either, but y'know if-if Ross says he's happy then we're just gonna have to keep our feelings about Emily to ourselves. Are you cool with that?
No! But y'know, I'm an actor, I'll act cool.
Ohh, whoa God! Storage rooms give me the creeps! Monica, come on please hurry up honey! Please?
Rachel, if you want the little round waffles, you gotta have to wait until I find the little waffle iron.
I want the little round waffles.
All right. Op, here it is! Right underneath the can of-of bug bomb. I wonder if the best place to put something that cooks food is underneath the can of poison?
Okay, y'know what? I'll-I'll have toast!
Arghhhh!!!!!!
Oh my God! Fog him! Fog him!
I don't know what I'm gonna do about this coat.
I'll take it!
That might work!
Ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah! Enh? All right, what do you think?
You're on in 5 Ms. Minnelli.
No-no-no, it's just a bit sudden. No, it's great. Okay? I'm totally on board. I love you too, all righty. Bye.
What's the matter Ross?
Nothing. Oh, actually, great news! I just got off the phone with Emily and it looks like I'm moving to a new apartment. Woo-hoo!
Why?
Well, her thought is, and I agree, fresh new furniture, why not a fresh new apartment? Her cousin has this great place to sublet, it's got a view of the river on one side and Columbia on the other.
That's way uptown! That's like three trains away! Which is great! I love to ride that rail!
So you're really okay with this?
Yes! Yes! I mean it's-it's kinda far from work, but uh, y'know, I'll get so much done on the commute. I-I've been given the gift of time!
Now that's so funny, because last Christmas I got the gift of space. We should get them together and make a continuum.
Now he's movin'? Man, what is Emily doing to him? Ow!! He's not even here!!!
You guys! You guys!
We were, we were just in the storage area and we saw this really creepy man!
It was like this crazy-eyed, hairy beast man! He was like a, like a bigfoot or a yeti or something!
And he came at us with an axe, so Rachel had to use a bug bomb on him!
Yeah, I-I-I just pulled the tab and I just fogged his yeti ass!
Uhh, like dark hair, bushy beard?
Yeah!
Yeah, you fogged Danny.
Please! We did not fog Danny! Who's Danny?
Dan just moved in downstairs. Yeah, he just got back from like this four-month trek in the Andes. Nice fella.
Oh he's nice. He's nice! Y'know, you always stick up for the people we fog!
Yeah?
Hi! You might not remember us, but we are the girls that fogged you.
We're-we're really sorry we fogged you.
Okay.
Hi! Just so you know, we-we didn't mean to fog you, we thought you were like a yeti or something.
Okay.
Yesss?
Hi! Sorry to bother you, but I don't think we can accept your acceptance of our apology, it just doesn't really seem like you mean it.
Yeah.
O-kay!
Wow! That guy is so rude!
Really! What is with that guy? I mean you'd forgive me if I fogged you.
Well you did a little bit.
Oh my God, honey, I'm so sorry!
I totally forgive you!
Really?
Yes!
Hey!
Hey!
So listen, you know my friend Chris who owns the crematorium?
Crematorium Chris? Sure!
He says, that he would cremate my fur coat for free if I umm, y'know, bring in the next person I know who dies.
Oh my God! Oh my God, look at these pelts!
Don't get too attached, she's having it cremated.
What? Uhh, Phoebe, honey, honey, I know you're quirky and I get a big kick out of it, we all do actually, but if you destroy a coat like this that is like a crime against nature! Not nature, fashion!
This is fashion?! Okay, so to you, death is fashion?! That's really funny. Here's Phoebe umm, sporting uh, y'know, cutting edge hairy carcass from y'know, the steal traps of wintry Russia. I mean, you really thing this looks good? 'Cause I do.
I know I miss you too. I can't wait to see you. I love you. Bye.
Okay, what is in here? Rocks?
No-no, this is my collection of fossil samples.
So, rocks.
I'm really gonna miss this apartment. Y'know, Ben-Ben took his first steps right over there.
Ohh. Hey, remember when I ran into this thing and it kinda knocked me out a little?
I loved this place! To tell you the truth, I wish I didn't have to move.
Uhh, are you saying that you're not entirely happy about this?
Well, I mean if uh, if Emily gave me a choice...
You do have a choice!! Ross, why are you listening to her?! Are you, are you crazy?!
Why?
It's not right what Emily wants you to do! She is totally--Owww!! Stop pinching me! Look, now you guys said I only had to keep my mouth shut as long as Ross was happy, right? Well he just told me that he's not entirely happy.
What's going on?
We all hate Emily!
Nooo!!
No, Ross, we do not hate Emily. We-we just, we just think that you're having to sacrifice a whole lot to make her happy.
Yeah!
Look, we just think that maybe she's being a little unreasonable.
Yes! Yes! Unreasonable!
Unreasonable? How about we have this conversation when one of you guys gets married! You have no idea what it takes to make a marriage work! All right, it's about compromise! Do you always like it? No! Do you do it? Yes! Because it's not all laughing, happy, candy in the sky, drinking coffee at Central Perk all the time! It's real life, okay? It's what grown-ups do!
I think he's right. You guys hang out at the coffeehouse way too much.
God, I feel so guilty about Ross.
Oh, I know.
I kinda feel like it's my fault.
Kind of? If you just kept this to yourself none of this would've happened.
Well, I'm keeping so many things to myself these days, something was bound to slip out!
Well, I think it's very brave what you said.
All right, I can't sit here anymore. I have to walk places.
Pheebs, what are you doing with the coat? How about the whole animal rights thing?
Well, I've been reading up and for your information, minks are not very nice. Okay, I admit it! I love this coat! Okay, I-it's the best thing I've ever had wrapped around me, including Phil Huntley! Remember Phil Huntley? He was fine!
Hi!
So you like the short hair better.
What? Yeti-I mean Danny?
I had to cut my hair to get rid of the uh, fogger smell.
Oh. Listen, I'm so sorry. I would, I would've never fogged you if y'know if you hadn't looked so.... Y'know.
Absolutely. Some people are just into appearances.
What?
That's cool. Cool.
What? Hey! No-no-no! This not cool! You don't even know me!
Come on, you got the shopping bags and the Sack's catalog.
So from that you think you've got me all figured out? Well, you don't! Y'know I-I could have toys for underprivileged kids in here!
Do you?
Well, y'know, if-if kids like to play with Capri pants.
Okay.
And stop saying that! I hate that!
Okay!
Fine! I judged you. I made a snap judgement. But you did it too! And you are worse because you are sticking to your stupid snap judgement! You can't even open up your mind for a second to see if you're wrong! What does that say about you?
The pizza-place across the street any good?
What?!
I'm hungry. Wanna get some pizza? You can keep yelling if there's more.
Okay. Okay.
Stop saying that. I hate that.
Uh, Ross?
Are you still mad at us?
Yep.
Oh good! Because we have an "I'm sorry" song.
Y'know what? I'm really not in the mood.
Look, Ross, I feel really bad. I mean, you're going through all this stuff and I just acted like a jerk.
Yeah, we are so sorry.
You're kinda stepping on the song.
Look, we were way out of line, we totally support you.
Whatever you decide, whatever you do.
Okay, now you're just taking lines right out of the song!
Look, this is hard enough! I really need you guys right now.
Yes! Exactly! And that's why...
Why don't you come over tonight? And I'll make you favorite dinner.
Okay. Thanks you guys. Pheebs are you wearing fur?
Okay, let's get some perspective people; it's not like I'm wearing a seeing-eye dog coat!
Hey, y'know Ross, I think I kinda understand why I kinda lost it today.
You do, huh?
Yeah you see umm, well, I'm an actor. Right? So I gotta keep my emotions right at the surface y'know? See what I'm saying? I gotta lot of balls in the air. Y'know what I mean? It's tough! Guys like me, y'know, you wander around, you're alone...
What are you talking about?
I'm not sure.
Hi!
Hey, look at you! Where have you been?
Oh, I went to have pizza. With Danny.
How did that happen?
That yeti is one smooth talker.
I hope you're not full, 'cause dinner's almost ready.
Yeah, y'know I-I think I'm just gonna hang out in my room.
No! Why?
Come on you guys! Listen, if Emily knew I was here having dinner you with you she would flip out and you know it. It's okay, I really... I don't mind.
Wait! Wait! Wait! Y'know what? Just stay. Please? It uh... It would really mean a lot to me if you stayed.
Ross, I...
RACHEL PLEASE!!! JUST HAVE DINNER WITH US!!!
Okay. Okay. Joey, it's okay. Settle down.
All right, I-I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You see Rach I'm an actor...
Hey! Hey, look! Ugly Naked Guy's back!
I haven't seen him in so long!
Oh God, I really missed that fat bastard!
Wow, this is so weird. I just realized this might be the last time we'll all be hanging out together.
It's almost as if he knew.
I'll get it. Hello. Hi Emily! Yeah, uh you-you tracked him down. Hold on one second.
Hey! Yeah-yeah, we're just having dinner. Uh, yeah, sure uh hold on. She wants to say hi. Hold on.
Hi Emily!
Hi!
Hello everyone. So who am I saying hello too?
Well uh, I don't know about who's here, but I can tell you for damn sure who's not here and that's Rachel!!
Well, I should hope not. Ross knows better than that by now.
Y'know what? Uh, Rachel is here!
She's there?!
Oh yeah, there-there she is!
Yeah, yeah, she's here.
Ross, take me off speakerphone.
Hi.
How can you do this too me?! I thought I'd made my feelings about Rachel perfectly clear!
Look Emily, I'm just having dinner with my friends, okay?
You obviously can't keep away from her.
Emily that's ridiculous. Look, I'm-I'm moving for you, I'm cutting friends out of my life for you. Please, just get on the plane and come to New York. Okay, you'll see you're the only person I want to be with.
I'll feel better when I'm there, and I can know where you are all the time.
Well, you can't know where I am all the time. Look, this marriage is never gonna work if you don't trust me.
You're right.
So, can you trust me?
No.
I think it's going okay. Looks like he's smiling.
How can you tell? You can only see the back of his head!
You can totally tell! Here look, watch me. Smile! Frown. Smile! Frown. Smile!
Well, I guess that's it.
Why, what happened?
What happened? What happened?
My marriage is over.
What?!
Oh, sweetie. Oh, look at you. You're shivering.
Here.
Ross, honey, is there anything we can do?
Yeah. You can help me get my furniture back from Gunther.
Okay, stop tormenting me! This mink! Okay, they're mean! And they hate squirrels! And y'know, okay, most of these probably wanted to be coats! All right, fine, now I get it. Here. You take it. Are you happy now? I'm cold!
Are you looking at naked tribe's women?
No, look.
That's a pig.
I know, I know, but look at the knobs on her.
Hey!
Emily's cousin kicked me out!
What?!
Why?
Well, when you're subletting an apartment from your wife's cousin and then you get a divorce, sometimes the cousin suddenly wants his apartment back.
How can he do that? Didn't you sign a lease?
Who needs a lease when it's family!
Hey, you can stay with us! We'll take care of ya!
Oh, yeah! Absolutely! Anything you need man! But you have to promise me the second you are feeling better so that we can make fun of your hair!
Yeah.
You got it.
Okay.
Thanks you guys, I really appreciate this. All right, I'm gonna get packing again. Man, I've been moving around so much I'm beginning to feel like a nomad.
What?
He thought you said gonad.
Wow, Monica, if every restaurant is as clean as yours, I'd have a tough time making a living.
Oh, Larry.
Umm, do health inspectors work on commission?
No, bribes.
It's okay to laugh right?
Yeah, I was just kidding.
Okay.
I'll check the kitchen floors.
Okay, knock yourself out, Larry.
Yum-my!
Larry?
Oh yeah! I'd let him check out my kitchen floors.
A 98. I deducted 2 points because you are not wearing your chef's hat, and that is a Section 5 violation.
Uh, look, Larry honey, umm, I wrote the book on Section 5 and I know that you don't have to wear your hat unless you're in the kitchen.
And where is your hat?
It's in the kitchen, I'll go get it.
Ahh that's the 2 points.
Hey, you should really read that book you wrote. Wow! You saw the hat in the kitchen and knew that she'd have to go in there hatless to get it. You can have your own health inspector detective show!
Oh, I don't know about that.
Yeah, but then I can be you sidekick Vunda.
Maybe uh, Vunda could give me her number and I can ask her to dinner sometime.
Okay, she would love that! Y'know, 'cause you know all the clean places to eat.
I-I'll call ya.
Okay.
He's so funny!
Thanks.
Thank you. Mon?
Hmm?
How's Ross doing? Y'know since all the Emily stuff.
He's not great umm, but he's dealing with it. Oh wait a minute, you're not gonna try...
Oh, honey, please, no, I can't get started with all that Ross stuff again. I mean, he's gonna screwed up for a looong time. And besides y'know, I don't, I don't go for guys right after they get divorced.
Right, you only go for them 5 minutes before they get married.
Two pounds of Moca Java please.
Danny. Are you guys ever gonna go out again?
I don't know! He hasn't called me since that one time when we went out. I see him in the hallway, we flirt, I'm all ha-ha-ha-ha, and nothing.
Hey!
Hi Danny! Wow! Thirsty huh?
Uh, actually, actually, I'm having a party at my place on Saturday, it's sort of a house warming kind of thing.
Ohh, fun!
Ohh, great!
Yeah, I'm really looking forward to it.
Yeah.
Okay, see ya.
Well, I guess we won't be warming his house.
Okay. All right, I see what he's doing! He's not asking me out, because he wants me to ask him out.
And you're not gonna do that.
That's right! 'Cause that would give him the control! So now he's all ooh, coming up with this whole I've got a party thing y'know, trying to get me to hint around for an invitation. Blew up in his face, didn't it?
So-so there is no party.
No, there's a party. There's a party. But the power, that is still up for grabs. You follow me?
I think so. Se, he-he's not inviting you to his party because he likes you.
Exactly.
Ross?
Hey roomies!
Love what you've done with the place.
Oh, yeah I know, I know, it's a lot of boxes, but again I really appreciate you guys letting me stay here.
Not a problem. And listen, hey! Since you're gonna be here for a while, why don't-I was thinking we uh, put your name on the answering machine.
Oh yeah!
Oh, I uh, hope you don't mind, I kinda uh, jazzed it up a little. Check this out. We will, we will, call you back!
Hey, all right!
Pretty cool, huh?
You're fake laughing too, right?
Oh, the tears are real.
You look beautiful this evening.
Show me the badge again.
Shiny.
Oh, will you mind if I wash up? Because I came straight from work and who knows where these babies have been.
You are just nonstop!
We're outta here!
Why?!
Just walking past the kitchen I saw 10 violations! I'm shutting this place down!
You have the power to do that?
This does.
Shut it down.
Hey.
What are you doing?
Nothing.
You built a fort didn't ya?
Kinda.
Oh my God, the air purifier! Ross's air purifier! All I heard through 4 years of college was
Dude, you should've gone out once and a while.
I hate this thing!
Come on, Chandler, Ross is our friend. He needs us right now, so why don't you be a grown up and come and watch some TV in the fort!
Oh, hi Danny.
Hey guys, I just uh, wanted to invite you to the party tomorrow night.
Oh, thanks! We'll try to stop by.
Uh, actually, I think I'm gonna be busy.
You are?
Yeah! Remember I got that uh, gala.
Yeah, what's the gala for?
It's a uh, regatta gala.
Really! You-you sail?
No-no, but I support it.
Okay, hope I see you tomorrow night.
Okay.
Take care.
Okay. Walked right into that one didn't he?
What one? You wanted him to invite you to the party and he did it!
Yeah, but he waited until the last minute! So if I said yes, he would know I had nothing better to do than wait around for an invitation to his stupid party. I said, "No!" Which puts me right back in the driver seat.
Great. So the ball is in his court?
Ball? There is no ball.
Joey, please!
Sorry.
Ahhhhhhhhhh...
Hello children!
Hey! Wanna play some foosball? Please?
Okay.
No-no, no! We have to move the table into my room, yeah! 'Cause of all the boxes. Come on!
All right, I have one question. What is the deal with this?
Bye-bye little puppet Joey hand?
No, the quiet down thing!
You mean this.
Um-hmm! Look, I-I-I don't know how much more of this I can take! Did you know he taped over my Baywatch tape with some show about bugs! My God! What if that had been porn?
All right look, y'know, this maybe tough but come on, this is Ross! I survived college with him!
All right, I guess I can hold out a little longer. Let's have a game.
Okay.
No-no-no-no!
YES!!
Uh fellas,
Okay, so he's out of here.
Um-hmm.
Hey!
Hey!
You guys got anything to eat? I just went down to Johnos for some chicken and it was closed!
Oh, I took Larry there to eat but it was all violated. So we shut it down!
Pheebs, if this guy keeps closing down all of our favorite places, where are we gonna eat?!
I don't know, clean places?
Umm, yum!
It's Danny.
Don't let him in! I'm supposed to be at a regatta gala.
We'll be right there! Can't you just say it starts later?
What? What kind of a regatta gala starts at night?!
The fake kind!
Hey, hi, I need a ladle. You got a ladle?
We have a ladle.
Thanks, see you at the party.
Okay, great!
Hey, guys, you know what Larry would say? He would say, "See you ladle."
Well, I-I-I'm done with this. You want anything Ross? Sports? International? Apartment listings?
I'll take sports.
Mine!
All right. Uhh, international.
Oh that's mine too! I'm Italian!
Well, I guess I can check out those apartment listings, even though there's never anything in here.
Not even on page 7?
Oh yeah! You're-hey, you're right! Here's an affordable place, two bedroom, close to work, ooh, it's available in five weeks!
What about that circled one?
Oh, I-I don't know, it's kind of expensive for a studio.
But it's available now! Isn't it?
Yes, it is.
Hey, let's go look at it!
Okay, let's go.
Okay!
There we go!
Oh-oh-ooh, hey guys, I was wondering if you guys would uh, maybe chip in on some new air filters for the air purifier? I mean after all, we all are using it.
Let's go quicker.
Yeah!
Oh my God!
Yeah, well look at this kitchen, slash bathroom. Well that's great! Y'know so you can cook while in the tub.
Somebody was using his head. Hey, let's check out the rest of the place.
I think this is it. I don't know, maybe we should keep looking.
But hey, Ross, this place is available now!
Yeah, you don't want to be stuck with us for the next five weeks.
Yeah.
So, you-you think I should go ahead and take this place?
Oh, it's perfect!
How about you?
It's a kitchen slash bathroom.
All right, I see what you guys are saying. I'll uh, I'll go downstairs and fill out an application.
We are bad people.
He knew we were trying to get rid of him. He knew! You think we could get a bathtub in our kitchen?
Hey, ready for dinner?
Ooh, absolutely!
Great! How about you wanted to go the Italian place down on Bleaker Street right?
Ooh, I love that place! So, no.
How about Mama Lisettie's?
Enh. Sure!
I wonder how long that milk has been setting out.
Oh, no-no, this place is totally healthy! That-this milk is mine. I bought this today, 'cause I was thirsty for milk, y'know. Okay, let's go!
Hey, buddy! Are you familiar with Section 11-B of the Health Code that requires all refuse material out the back exit?
But then I'd have to go all the way around the dry cleaner place.
Oh, so you're saying you'd choose convenience over health?!
Okay, stop! Larry, okay, can't you just be Larry and not Larry the health inspector guy? Y'know I mean it was really exciting at first but now it's like, okay, so where are we gonna eat ever?
Well, I suppose I could give him a warning.
Thank you. Okay, go! Go! Go! Now, if after dinner you still really need to bust someone, I know a hot dog vendor who picks his nose.
Maybe, maybe we did a good thing, helping Ross get back on his feet!
Yes that was a nice place!
Yeah!
Not a lot of closet space, but he can just hang his stuff out the window in a bag!
Yeah!
What are we gonna do?
I don't know. Maybe pizza?
About Ross!
Oh! Oh!
Hello! Oh yeah! It's the apartment manager; Ross put us down as references. Ross is the greatest guy you'll ever meet! Yeah, he's very reliable.
Of course he has this big huge dog! That uh, barks into the night. Well, who doesn't love dogs? Ah, he's a tap dancer! Yes, some would say that is a lost art. He's a pimp! There you go! Yes, he's a pimp. He's a big, tap dancing pimp! Hello?
Ohhhhh!
Shoot, shoot, this is never gonna work! He's right there!
Just go over and say hi.
No, I have to go downstairs and come back up as if I'm coming home from the regatta gala. Okay? So just go distract him. But don't be sexy.
Hey, Danny!
Hey! What's going on?
Oh, it's a great party! Great food. Y'know, most parties it's all chips and salsa, chips and salsa. So umm, what's this?
Salad.
Ooooh! And-and-and what-what's this?
Bread. Aren't you a chef?
Oh.
Hey! Rachel!
Hey! Oh right, tonight was your party.
Oh wow, you look great! Glad you could make it.
Oh well, y'know, the gala had to end sometime.
Don't go anywhere, I'll be right back.
Yeah, sure. All right, whose court is the ball in now?
I thought there wasn't a ball?
Oh, come on! He's glad that I came, he doesn't want me to go anywhere, balls flying all over the place!
Rachel, this is my friend Tom. This is the girl I told you about.
Oh, go on! You telling people about me?
You two could really hit it off! I'm gonna go mingle.
So you work at Bloomingdale's, huh? My mom calls it Bloomies.
Yeah, okay, at ease solider!
I'm sorry?
No, it's all right, you can just drop the act Tommy. I know what's going on here. Your Danny's wingman right? You guys are best buds. Frat bros!
I'm gonna go talk to uh, a friend.
Yeah, yeah, you go talk to your friend. You tell him, "Nice try."
Man! He just keeps lobbing them up and I just keep knocking them right out of the park!
I think I need a drink.
Yeah!
98. 99. 100. Okay, go!
Dude, I'm telling ya! I'm fine!
Here we go! Here we go!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey. So I uh, I didn't get that apartment. Some problem with my application.
You're kidding!
You're kidding, no!
Yeah. But, the good news is that Phoebe said that I could stay at her place for a while. So...
But you can't stay with Phoebe, Ross! We're-we're roomies!
Look, you guys don't need me here taking up your space.
Well, we got plenty of space! There-there's still some over there by-by that speaker. Please, just stay!
Yeah!
Are you guys sure about this?
Definitely!
Yes! Ross, you have to stay!
All right.
All right!
All right, buddy!
So I'm a pimp huh? It's okay! Look, I know that sometimes I can be a pain in the ass, but you just have to talk to me. Tell me if something is bothering you. Okay? And for my part I will do everything I can to keep my annoying habits just .
Well, I see you've had a very productive day. Don't you think the cowboy hat is a little much?
Come on, it's fun!
All right! Isn't this a woman's hat?
Dude, stop talking crazy and make us some tea!
Oh Monica that was the best Thanksgiving dinner ever! I think you killed us.
I couldn't possibly eat another bite.
I need something sweet.
Does anyone wanna watch TV?
Yeah, sure.
Monica your remote doesn't work.
Phoebe, you have to lift it and point.
Oh. Aw, forget it.
Yeah, you know what we should all do? We should play that game where everyone says one thing that they're thankful for.
Ooh-ooh, I! I am thankful for this beautiful fall we've been having.
That's very nice.
That's sweet, Joey.
Yeah, the other day I was at the bus-stop and this lovely fall breeze came in out of nowhere and blew this chick's skirt right up. Oh! Which reminds me, I'm also thankful for thongs.
I mean, it's not so much an underpant as it is a feat of engineering. I mean, it's amazing how much they can do with so little material! And the way they play with your mind! Is it there? Is it not there?
Are you aware that you're still talking?
Is anyone thankful for anything else besides a thong?
Huh, I don't know what to pick. Am I more thankful for my divorce or my eviction? Hmm.
Wow! See, and I didn't think you'd be able to come up with anything.
I'm sorry. It's just that this is the worse Thanksgiving ever.
No-no-no! I am the king of bad Thanksgivings. You can't just swoop in here with your bad marriage and take that away from me.
Oh, you're not gonna tell the whole story about how your parents got divorced again are you?
Oh God, no.
Oh, come on! I wanna hear it! It wouldn't be Thanksgiving without Chandler bumming us out!
It's a tradition, like the parade. If the parade decided it was gay, moved out, and abandoned its entire family.
Now Chandler dear, just because your father and I are getting a divorce it doesn't mean we don't love you. It just means he would rather sleep with the house-boy than me.
More turkey Mr. Chandler?
You're right. Yours is worse. You are the king of bad Thanksgivings.
I don't know about that. I've got one that's worse.
Really? Worse than, "More turkey Mr. Chandler?"
Oh, did the little rich boy have a problem with the butler? Yes, mine's worse!
More bandages! More bandages! Please, can I get some more bandages in here! This man is dying- Oh no.
In this life, Phoebe.
Oh, this life! Oh okay no, Chandler's is worse.
Man, it must be so cool remembering stuff like that! I don't have any past life memories.
Of course you don't sweetie. You're brand new.
I know Monica's worst Thanksgiving.
Oh, let's not tell this story.
Oh, come on!
Oh no, I know! I know! It's the one where Joey got Monica's turkey stuck on his head!
What?! Joey got a turkey stuck on his head?!
Hey, it's not like it sounds.
It's exactly like it sounds.
Hello?
Hello?
Phoebe?
Joey? What's going on?
Look.
Oh my God!
I know! It's stuck!!!
Easy. Step. How did it get on?
I put it on to scare Chandler!
Oh my God! Monica's gonna totally freak out!
Well then help me get it off! Plus, it smells really bad in here.
Well, of course it smells really bad. You have your head up a dead animal.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey, did you get the turkey basted-Oh my God! Oh my God! Who is that?
It's Joey.
What-what are you doing? Is this supposed to be funny?
No, it's not supposed to be funny, it's supposed to be scary.
Well, get it off now!
I can't! It-it's stuck!
Well, I don't care! That-that turkey has to feed 20 people at my parent's house and they're not gonna eat it off your head!
All right, hold on! Okay, let's just all think.
Okay, I got it. Phoebe? All right, you pull. I'm gonna spread the legs as wide as I can. Joey? Now is not the time!
Sorry! Sorry.
Okay, count to three. 1. 2. 3!
Arghhhhhh!!
It worked! I scared ya, I knew it! Ha-ha!
I'm over here big guy.
Yeah, you are! I scared you!
You did look like an idiot.
Hey, I wasn't the only one who looked like an idiot. All right? Remember when Ross tried to say, "Butternut squash?" And it came out, "Squatternut buash?"
Yeah that's the same.
That's it. That's my worse Thanksgiving.
Oh wait! That can't be the one Rachel's talking about. She didn't even know that happened. So which one was it?
Which one?
Umm, I-I really don't want to tell this story.
Oh, come on Monica, reliving past pain and getting depressed is what Thanksgiving is all about. Y'know, for me anyway. And of course, the Indians.
Look umm, of all people, you do not want me to tell this story!
Monica! I think Rachel's here!
I'll get it! Happy Thanksgiving!
Not for me. Chip and I broke up!
Oh, why? Why? What happened?
Well, you know that my parents are out of town and Chip was going to come over...
Yeah, yeah, and you were going him y'know, your flower.
Okay, Monica, can you just call it sex?! It really creeps me out when you call it that! Okay, and by the way, while we're at it, a guy's thing is not called his tenderness. Believe me! Hi!
Hi Rachel!
Happy Thanksgiving!
You too sweethart!
Hey!
Oh my!
Uh, everyone, this is Chandler! My roommate and lead singer of our band!
Ross!
Oh, this is Monica.
Hi, I'm Ross's little sister.
Okay.
I'm so glad you could come Chandler, we've got plenty of food so I hope you're hungry.
Oh, mom. Mom. Chandler hates Thanksgiving and doesn't eat any Thanksgiving food.
Oh, well, I'm so glad you brought him here then.
Umm, Chandler, if you want I can make you some macaroni and cheese for dinner.
Well, as long as the pilgrims didn't eat it, I'm in.
dammit!
So uh, Rach? Does it, does it feel weird around here now? Y'know since I've been away at college.
Oh! No, not really.
Well, that's cool. So did...
Ugh! I cannot believe Chip dumped me for that slut Nancy Branson. I am never going out with him again. I don't care how much he begs!
I think his begging days are over now that he's going out with Nancy Branson.
Y'know what? I've just had it with high school boys! They are just silly. Silly, stupid boys! I'm going to start dating men!
Umm, I'm sorry Judy, I couldn't find that bowl that you and Jack were looking for.
Call them mom and dad you loser!
Monica!
Hey Chandler! Did you like the macaroni and cheese?
Oh yeah, it was great. You should be a chef.
Okay!
Guess what?! All that stuff about Nancy Branson being a slut was all a rumor so Chip dumped her and he wants to come over to my house tonight!
Oh that's so great!
I know!
Oh gosh, listen if you and Chip do it tonight, promise me you'll tell me everything.
Oh totally, totally. Y'know it's not that big of deal, we already kinda did it once y'know.
I know, but y'know, this time you're gonna definitely know whether or not you did it!
I know, I know. And oh, and this time Chip promised that-that this time it will last at least for an entire song!
So I'm thinking about asking Rachel out tonight. Y'know maybe play her that song we wrote last week.
Emotional Knapsack?
Yeah.
Right on! Oh! Uh, but, don't take to long okay? 'Cause uh, we're gonna test out our fake ID's tonight, right Clifford Alverez.
Listen, Roland Chang, if things go well, I'm gonna be out with her all night.
Dude, don't do that too me!
All right, it's cool you can stay here. My parents won't mind.
No, it's not that, I just don't want to be stuck here all night with your fat sister.
Hey!
Monica, why don't you finish off these pies? I don't have any more room left in the fridge.
No. No, thank you!
Well Judy, you did it! She's finally full!
I called you fat?! I don't even remember that!
Well, I do.
I am so sorry. I really am. I was an idiot back then. I rushed the stage at a Wham concert for crying out loud!
Oh, I can't believe you called her fat.
I can't believe you let George Michael slap you.
I am really sorry. That is so terrible. I am so, so sorry.
Actually, y'know that's not the Thanksgiving I was talking about.
Yes, it was!
No, it wasn't. It was actually the...
Okay, now Thanksgiving's over, let's get ready for Christmas. Who wants to go get a Christmas tree?!
Oh, no, I have the cutest Christmas story!
We wanna hear Monica's Thanksgiving story!
Fine, all right, mine had a dwarf that got broke in half, but y'know whatever.
So Rachel, your mom tells me you changed your major again.
Oh, yeah, I had too. There was never any parking by the Psychology building.
Hi Rachel.
Oh hi!
Wow, love your new nose!
Jack.
What? Dr. Wilson's an artist! He removed my mole cluster. Wanna see?
I'll get it.
No, God! Please, let me!
Hey!
Hey. Happy Thanksgiving!
God, your hair sure is different!
Yeah, we were just talking about that. I can't believe how stupid we used to look.
So uh, where's Monica?
She's upstairs. Monica! Come down! Everyone's here! Ross, Rachel, and the boy who hates Thanksgiving.
Hi, Chandler.
Oh my God!
What-what's the matter? Is there, is there something on my dress?
You just, you look so different! Terrific! That dress! That body!
Dude!
Sorry!
Yes, yes Monica is thin. It's wonderful. But what we really want to hear about is Ross's new girlfriend.
Oh mom! Okay, umm, her name is Carol. And she's really pretty. And smart. And uh, she's-she's on the lacrosse team and the golf team. Can you believe it? She plays for both teams!
So Chandler, I guess I'll see you at dinner.
Dude!
Sorry.
Oh-ho, my God! That was so awesome! You totally got him back for calling you fat! He was just drooling all over you. That must've felt so great!
Well it didn't!
What?!
Yeah, I mean yeah, I look great. Yeah, I feel great and yeah, my heart is not in trouble anymore! Blah, blah, blah! Y'know I still don't feel like I got him back, y'know? I just want to humiliate him. I wanna, I want him to be like naked and then I'm going to point at him and laugh!
Okay, that we may be able to do.
How?
Well guys tend to get naked before they're gonna have sex.
What?! I mean, I didn't work this hard and-and-and lose all this weight so that I can give my flower to someone like him!
Okay, first of all, if you keep calling it that, no one's gonna ever take it. Then, second of all you're not actually gonna have sex with him! You're just gonna make him think that you are.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And when he's naked I can throw him out in the front yard and lock the door and all the neighbors will just humiliate him!
Then, you will definitely get him back!
Okay, so how do I make him think I wanna have sex with him?
Okay, oh, here's what you do. Just act like everything around you turns you on.
What do you mean?
Well, like anything can be sexy. Like umm, oh-oh, like this dishtowel! Ooh, ooh, this feels sooo good against my cheek! And-and if I feel a little hot, I can just dab myself with it. Or I can bring it down to my side and bring it through my fingers while I talk to him.
I can do that!
Yeah? Okay! Good, good, because he's coming. He's coming. Hey, what's up?
Monica, I was wondering if you can make me some of that righteous mac and cheese like last year.
Umm, I'd love too! Ooh, I love macaroni and cheese. I love-I love the way this box feels against my cheek.
Okay.
Boy, I love carrots! Oh! Sometimes I like to put them between my fingers like this and-and hold them down here while I talk to you. Umm, and-and-and y'know if I get really hot umm, I-I like to pick up this knife and-and umm, I-I put the cold steal against umm, my body.
Are you all right?
Oh yeah, of course. I'm fine it's just that-
What do we got here?
Twenty year old has got a severed toe on his right foot.
Can you please not do that feet first? You know where his injury is! Severed toe, you just said it!
It says here that the knife went right through your shoe.
Of course it did. They're made of wicker.
Did you bring the toe?
Oh yes! I have it right here, on ice!
Don't worry son, we'll just attach it and-
What?! What is it?
You brought a carrot.
What?
This isn't your toe, this is a small, very cold piece of carrot.
You brought a carrot?!
Oh my God! There's a toe in my kitchen.
God, I'm sorry! I'll go back and get it!
It's too late, all we can do now is sow up the wound.
Without my toe?! I need my toe!
Wait, no-no-no, I can go really fast! Dad, give me the keys to your Porsche!
Oh, I'm not falling for that one!
That's why I lost my toe?! Because I called you fat?!
I didn't mean to cut it off. It was an accident.
That's why for an entire year people called me Sir Limps-A-Lot?!
I'm sorry! It wasn't your whole toe!
Yeah, well, I miss the tip! It's the best part. It has the nail.
Chandler!
Sir Limps-A-Lot, I came up with that.
You're a dork.
I can't believe this.
Chandler, I said I was sorry.
Yeah, well, sorry doesn't bring back the little piggy that cried all the way home! I hate this stupid day! And everything about it! I'll see you later.
Oh wait, Chandler, come here is there anything I can do? Anything?
Yeah, just leave me alone for a while.
Oh-oh, I'm a duck! I go, "Quack, quack!" I'm happy all the time!
Nice try.
Wait, wait, wait!
Look, Monica...
Look!
This is not going to work.
I bet this will work!
You are so great! I love you!
What?
Nothing! I said, I said "You're so great" and then I just, I just stopped talking!
You said you loved me! I can't believe this!
No I didn't!
Yes, you did!
No I didn't!
You love me!
No I don't! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
Gauze! Gauze! I need to get some gauze in here! Can I please get some gauze in here! Whew! This is getting ridiculous uh!
What am I sitting on?
Top of the world? Dock of the bay? I'm out.
Ew-eww!! Undies!
All right! Who's are they? Who's are they?
Well, they're not mine!
Well, they're Joey's! They gotta be Joey's!
Yeah, they're mine.
See? They're Joey's! J-J-J-J-J-Joey's!
Why are they here?
I don't know uhh... Well, I'm Joey. Yeah, I'm disgusting, I take my underwear off in other people's homes.
Well, get 'em out of here! What's wrong with you?
Yeah!
Yeah!
Take 'em! Joey, you can touch them! They're your underwear.
Chandler? A word.
That's it! I'm tired of covering for you two! This has got to stop! Ahh! And tighty-whiteys! What are you, 8?
Thank you Joey, thank you so much!
Oh hey, no, you're not welcome. Okay, look, I hate this! You guys keep embarrassing me! Yesterday, Rachel found your razor in our bathroom and I didn't know what to say, so I said it was mine and-and that I was playing a woman in a play. And one thing led to another and
Wow! And around the ankles, y'know that is a tough spot.
Yeah, it was! All right, listen, I can't...
All this lying has been hard on us too.
Oh-oh, yeah-yeah, I bet all the sex makes it easier!
Well, yeah actually.
We'll try to be more careful okay? It's just that, we don't want everyone to know because this is going really well, and maybe the reason it's going really well is because it's a secret.
I know it sounds really weird, but we're just so bad at relationships.
We are! Help us!
Help!
All right! But, you do it with me once.
Joey!
Didn't think so.
Hey, Phoebe!
Hi, Pheebs!
Hey, Pheebs!
Hey, Pheebs!
What are you reading?
Umm, Wethering Heights. I'm taking a literature class at the New School and I have to finish it for the first session tomorrow.
I didn't know you were taking a class. That is so cool.
Yeah! Well, I really liked that Lamaze class I took! Y'know and this time I thought I'd go for something, y'know a little more intellectual, with a less painful final exam.
Honey that sounds like fun.
Yeah! Ooh, you should come with me! Oh yeah, then I'd have someone to sit with!
Okay.
Yeah! Okay-ooh, but are you going to have time to read it?
Oh, I read that in high school.
This is going to be so much fun! Okay-shhh, I have to finish.
Hi.
What's wrong buddy?
Someone at work ate my sandwich!
Well, what did the police say?
My Thanksgiving leftover sandwich. I can't believe someone ate it!
Ross, it's just a sandwich!
Just a sandwich? Look, I am 30 years old, I'm about to be divorced twice and I just got evicted! That sandwich was the only good thing going on in my life! Someone ate the only good thing going on in my life!
Okay, look, I-I have enough stuff for one more sandwich, I mean I was going to eat it myself, but
That-that would be incredible. Thank you so much. I-I still can't believe someone ate it!! I mean, look, I left a note and everything.
Knock-knock. Who's there? Ross Geller's lunch. Ross Geller's lunch, who? Ross Geller's lunch, please don't take me. Okay?
I'm surprised you didn't go home wearing your lunch.
Okay, look you wanna hold onto your food? You gotta scare people off. I learned that living on the street.
Really?! So what would you say Pheebs? Stuff like uh, "Keep your mitts off my grub?"
Say Ross, when you picture Phoebe living on the street, is she surrounded by the entire cast of Annie?
Okay, this will keep them away from your stuff.
Whoa! Ohh!!
Phoebe, you are a bad ass!
Someday I'll, tell you about the time I stabbed the cop.
Phoebe?
Well, he stabbed me first!!
Sorry I'm late, but I left late.
Okay.
So Pheebs, what is the book about?
I thought you said you read it in high school.
Well yeah, but then I remembered I started it and there was this pep rally and I was, I was on top of the pyramid but anyway-umm, what is this book about?
Okay, umm, it's this tragic love story between Cathy and Heathcliff and umm, it takes place on like these really creepy mores in England. Which I think represents the wildness of Heathcliff's character. I totally get symbolism.
How would you characterize the theme of this book, uh let's see here , Rachel Green?
Umm, well I would have to say that it's a, it's tragic love story.
Well, that's sort of a given, but yes. Anyone else?
Oh-oh-oh, symbolism! And uh, the-the uh, wildness of the mores, which I think is-is mirrored in the wildness of Heathcliff's character.
Excellent! What Rachel has shrewdly observed here...
You completely stole my answer!
Well, honey that was pretty obvious.
Well how would you know?! You didn't even read it!
What do you think? You in the blue shirt.
I think that uh, yours is a question with many answers.
Would ya care to venture one?
Would you care to venture one?
Are you just repeating what I'm saying?
Are you just repeating what I'm saying?
All right, let's move on.
Okay then.
Yeah but why didn't you just say that you didn't read the book?!
Be-because I didn't want him to think I was stupid! I mean, that was really embarrassing what happened to you!
Phoebe!
Yeah?
Phoebe! You're note, amazing! Not only did no one touch my sandwich, but people at work are actually afraid of me. Yeah, a guy called me mental! Mental Geller, yeah, I always wanted a cool nickname like that.
Yeah, the best you got in high school was Wet Pants Geller.
That was the water fountain! Okay?! Anyway, people are writing reports for me, uh pushing back deadlines to meet my schedule, I'm telling you, you get tough with people you can get anything you want. Hey Tribbiani, give me that coffee! Now!
God, this was really fun! I've been wondering if you were going to ask me out.
So you uh, still wondering?
No, we just went out.
You're smart. I like that.
Oh, candles! What is that? A blanket? A video camera? Oh my God!
Oh no-no-no-no, wait-wait-wait!!
I can't believe you thought that you were going to video tape us having sex on the first date!
Hiya.
Joey, is what she just said umm-Oh my God. You were actually gonna...
What is going on here?
And with Chandler in the next room. What are you, what are you sick?
I'm Joey. I mean, I'm disgusting. I make low-budget adult films.
You guys promised you'd be more careful! I mean, come on! The good Joey name is being dragged through the mud here!
We're so sorry.
Yeah.
Well, I'm telling everyone about you! That's the only way to explain the underwear and the video camera that doesn't make me look like a pig!
No-no, wait! There's got to be a better explanation. You can tell them you had to make an adult film for your adult film class.
Yeah, I like that. But no-no, how does that explain why Rachel found my underwear at your place?
Oh-I don't know.
Well, get ready to come out of the non-gay closet!
Okay, just wait, please. I promise we'll come up with something. Just give us a little more time.
All right. Hey, but it better make me look really, really good. Oh, and another thing, the video camera? Nice!!
Umm, Ross. May I have a word with you?
Yeah, of course, Donald.
We've been getting reports of some very angry behavior on your part.
What?!
Threatening letters, refusal to meet deadlines, apparently people now call you mental.
Yeah.
We want you to speak to a psychiatrist.
Oh no, you-you don't understand. Ugh, this is so silly. Umm, this is all because of a sandwich.
A sandwich?
Yeah. You see my-my sister makes these amazing turkey sandwiches. Her secret is, she puts a, an extra slice of gravy soaked bread in the middle; I call it the Moist Maker. Anyway, I-I put my sandwich in the fridge over here...
Oh, you know what?
What?
I-I'm sorry. I, I-I-I believe I ate that.
You ate my sandwich?
It was a simple mistake. It could happen to anyone.
Oh-oh really? Did you confuse it with your own turkey sandwich with a Moist Maker?
No.
Do you perhaps seeing a note on top of it?
There may have been a-a joke or a limerick of some kind.
That said it was my sandwich?!
Now-now calm down. Come look in my office, some of it my still be in the trash.
What?
Well, it was quite large. I-I-I-I-I had to throw most of it away.
You-you-you-you threw my sandwich away!
MY SANDWICH?!!!
MY SANDWICH!!!!!!
Hi!
Hi!
So umm, what's this book about?
You didn't read this one either?!
Well, I was gonna, but I accidentally read something else.
What?
Vogue! Hey, so tell me about this Jane Eyre woman.
No! You should've read it yourself!
Come on Phoebe! Don't be such a goodie-goodie!
Fine! Okay, all right, so Jane Eyre, first of all, you'd think she's a woman, but she's not. She's a cyborg.
A cyborg?! Isn't that like a robot?!
Yeah, this book was light years ahead of its time.
Sorry I'm late. Let's get started. So, what did everybody think about Jane Eyre?
Umm, Rachel and I were just discussing it and she had some very interesting insights.
Well, go ahead Rachel.
Uh, thank you Phoebe. Umm, well, what struck me most when reading Jane Eyre was uh, how the book was so ahead of its time.
If you're talking about feminism, I think you're right.
Yeah, well, feminism yes, but also the robots.
Hey.
Hey. Okay, so umm, since that video camera thing didn't work out uh, I thought that I would give you just a little preview.
You're naked in this picture!
I know.
Ross?
Hey Chandler. Monica!
Ross, are you okay?
I'm fine! I saw a psychiatrist at work today.
Why?!
On account of my rage.
Which I may say, right now, is out of control.
He gave me a pill for it.
A pill?
Uh-huh. Well, when the psychiatrist told me I had to take a leave of absence because I yelled at my boss I started to get worked up again, so he offered me a tranquilizer. And I thought was a good idea so, I took it.
Wait a minute, they're making you take time off work?
And you're okay with that?
I don't know. It's going to be weird not having a job for a while, but I, I definitely don't care about my sandwich.
Ugh, that was so embarrassing! I can't believe you let me go on and on like that!
I'm sorry. It was just so funny when you started comparing Jane Eyre to Robocop.
That was not funny!
Well, I snapped! Okay? You weren't taking the class seriously.
Phoebe, come on! What is the big deal? I thought this was going to be something we could do together! Y'know, I thought it would be fun!
Well, yeah! Fun is good, but y'know I also wanted to learn. Y'know, people are always talking about what they learned in high school and I never went to high school.
Ohh. Oh, so you really wanted to learn. Yeah, y'know, Pheebs I just wanted to have fun. Ohh, you know who you should go with?
I know! I know! I know!
Monica, you asked the question.
Oh my God! That's Monica!!
Oh no-no-no! No-no-no-no-no-no-no!
You get away from me!! You sick, sick, sick, sick-o!!
What's going on?
Joey has got a secret peephole!
Oh no! No! No! No!
Yes! He has a naked picture of Monica! He takes naked pictures of us! And then he eats chicken and looks at them!
Look!
Dude! That's my sister!
Give me that!
All right, wait! Just wait. Everybody just calm down. Okay? Let's give our friend Joey a chance to explain why he's such a big pervert!
No! I am not a pervert! Okay? It's just... I just... Kinda...
All right, look! Look. I think I can explain this.
Thank you!
Joey's a sex addict.
What?!! No I'm not!!
It's okay! It's good! It's good. It's a disease!
No! No! I am not a sex addict!
Yes you are! That's the only way to explain all this stuff!
No it isn't! No, it's not. Because you can also explain it with the truth!
Well, what is the truth?
Yeah, what's going on?
What's going on?
I slept with Monica.
Well let's....let's see what everybody thinks of that?
Oh no!
You slept with my sister?
Uh yes, but it was, we just did it once uh, in London.
This is not good for my rage.
Monica, is this true?
Of course it's true! How else would you explain all the weird stuff that's been going on?
Yes it's true.
Okay, but if it only happened that one time, how come we found your underwear in our apartment the other day?
Ahh-oy! That was the underwear I was wearing that night in London. Right Monica?
I guess I wanted to keep it as a souvenir.
My God Monica!!
Are you sure Joe? Are you sure you're not just a sex addict?
No! If anyone's a sex addict here, it's Monica! Yeah. Yeah. She has been trying to get me back in the sack ever since London!
So that's why she gave you a naked picture of herself.
That makes sense!
And the video camera?
Uhh, Monica?
I guess I set up the video camera to try and entice Joey.
But sadly I could not be enticed.
Unbelievable! I mean you really kept Joey's underwear?! Why? Why would you do that?!
I'm Monica. I'm disgusting. I stalk guys and keep their underpants.
Well, I think we've all learned something about who's disgusting and who's not. Eh? All right, now, I'm going to get back to my bucket. I'm only eating the skin, so the chicken's up for grabs.
I really thought you making a good point. I mean y'know, until you got cut off.
Yeah, what's up with that girl Monica?
I don't know! I didn't come with her!
All right everybody! Everybody guess what? I just convinced Paul to give us a test next week!
A test?!!
Come on! Tests make us all better learners! Oh yeah! We should have essay questions!!
What are you doing?
I...Reorganized The Fridge. See, Bottom Shelf: Meats And Dairy. And Top Shelf expired products.
Why are you doing this?
Because I am bored...Out of my mind. I've already been to the bank, post office, and the dry cleaners.
Dude, you just described seven days worth of stuff. You've got to spread it out a little, you know. Haven't you ever been unemployed?
Hey, I am not unemployed. I'm on sabbatical!
Hey, don't get religious on me, ok. A guy in your position needs to be a little better at relaxing. You know. Why do you think we have the comfortable chairs? Huh...come here...sit down. Ready? Ahh!! Ohh, yeah!! Huh?!
So what, we just sit?
Ohh, no, no. We're not going to just sit. Shhh.
Hello, Chandler Bing.
Hello Mr. Bing...I love you.
Alright, whoever this is, stop calling me! It's been six months! It's not funny!
But, I love you.
Leave me alone! For the love of God, leave me alone!!!
And that's Wednesday. Ohh.
Hey you guys, guess what?
The British are coming?
Ohh, you and your ways. Since it's Christmastime. I'm going to be one of those people collection donations.
Ohh.
Yeah, I already have my bell and later on...I get my bucket.
Ohh.
Yeah, yeah, I'm going to be out there spreading joy to the people. I mean, last year, I spread a little joy but not really enough. So this year, I'm going to do the whole city.
You know, I knew a girl in high school who did that. She was very popular.
So Pheebs, where are you doing all, your bell ringing?
Ohh, they gave me a great spot. Right by Macys. Yeah, they hardly ever give such a good spot to a rookie, but I'm the only one who can sing "Merry Christmas" in 25 languages. I lied.
Oh my god. Ok you guys, there's Danny. Watch. Just watch this. See?! Still pretending he's not interested. Ohh, he's coming over. Just pretend like we don't know him. We've forgotten who he is.
Hey guys.
Hey Danny.
Danny? You know Rachel? She's nice. She's not bad to look at, right?
Thanks, Mon.
Well, of course.
Do you want to go out on a date with her?
Monica!!!
Absolutely! Is Friday okay?
Friday's perfect...She can't wait.
On the date, I will be able to talk to her directly? See ya Friday.
Okay. What the hell was that? You know what? Don't answer me. I have a date with Danny.
How could I not get the part? The play was about a 29-year-old Italian actor from Queens.
Well, Telia Shire suddenly became available.
She's a woman!
What can I say? She nailed it.
Okay, is there anything else?
Well, you're just going to say no again but...gay porn.
Happy Holidays. Feliz Navidad. Allo, and Merry Christmas. Ohh thank you sir. Here's some joy.
Phoebe!
Hey!
I just wanted to see how it's going.
Well, it's going okay.
Well good, here let me help you out.
Oh, thanks!
Yeah!
Wow!
Is that a new Swede jacket? It looks really expensive.
Yeah. I guess.
Just get your nails done?
Yes Phoebe, but this is all I have. Okay?
Okay! Thanks! Happy Holidays, here's your joy.
Thank you! And Happy Holidays.
Wait, you can't take the money out.
I'm making change. I need change for the bus.
But, can't you leave the dollar? This money is for the poor.
I'm poor! I gotta take the bus!
Okay, Seasons Greetings and everything, but still...
Bite me, blondie!
Oh, I'm going to give him something else besides joy, just...
That part was perfect for me! I can't believe I didn't get it!
I'm sorry, man. Hey, y'know what you should do? You should make something happen for yourself. Y'know, like-like write a play. Write a movie! Huh? I mean, what about those Good Will Hunting guys?
Come on Ross be realistic, y'know? If I did write something, what are the chances I could get those guys to star in it?
Wait a second, I could star in it!
Or that.
I can't write! Y'know I mean I-I-I'm an actor, I don't have the discipline that takes, y'know? I can't do it.
I'll help you. Yeah, I'll make up a schedule and make sure you stick to it. And plus, it'll give me something to do.
Really? You'd-you'd do that for me?!
Yeah!
Thanks!
All right, we'll start off slow. The only thing you have to do tonight is come up with the name of your main character.
Done!
And it can't be Joey.
It's not.
Or Joseph.
Oh.
Hey, what's up?
I just saw Danny getting on the subway with a girl and he had his arm around her.
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.
Well, you should be, this is all your fault! You meddled in our relationship!!
You had no relationship!!
No, but I was doing my thing and everything was going according to the plan!
Oh God, stop with the plan! So what, so what you saw him with a girl? Who cares?! That doesn't mean anything! Now look, you're going to go out on a date with Danny and you're going to be so charming he's gonna forget all about that stupid subway girl.
She was kinda stupid. You're right. All right, I'm just gonna go on the date. I'm gonna go on the date. That is the new plan.
Come on, hurry!
Hey, how do you spell suspicious?
Why?
Because I think this character is going to be suspicious about stuff.
Yes! Chandler Bing, 7! Chandler Bing, 0.
You're driving me crazy with that!
Okay, I'll stop.
Don't stop! Move the bowl further away! Ross could make that shot!
Well, you suck! But at least you suck at a man's game now.
You wanna play?
Chandler, I can't be playing games, Ross is gonna be home soon. And I have to write five whole pages if I'm gonna stick to his schedule.
Well, so, play for the next 30 minutes and then write until he gets home.
All right! But uh, listen, what do you say we crank it up a notch?
I'm intrigued.
All right, all we need is a little lighter fluid.
Okay, but be careful okay, because I wanna get our security deposit back.
Yeah, I think we said good-bye to that when we invented hammer darts.
Do you even remember which part of the wall is not spackle?
Uh yeah, right here.
Thank you, Happy Holidays.
Now, that's trash. Young lady, you can't... Hey! Stop that young lady, she donated trash!
Hey!! The charity's on fire! Help! Oh good! Thank you, I need that. Whoa! What is that?! It's nine o'clock in the morning!
All right. A room. A man enters, he looks suspicious. That's it? Joey, you're supposed to have five pages done by now! Including an exciting incident! And what is, and what is all this?! The official rulebook of Fireball.
Yeah, that's the uh, game we were playing.
Oh yeah, it's great! See you take a tennis ball, a bowl, and some lighter fluid-Op! Op!
This is helping your career?! Huh? I thought you wanted to be an actor not the creator of crazy lawsuit game!
You're right, you're right, I'll get back to work.
And shame on you! You should know better, Joey needs to work. Now come on!
Hey!
No! Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah! You can have this back when the five pages are done! Ahh!
I had a really nice time tonight.
So did I. I'm really glad Monica asked us out.
I'd love to ask you in, but uh, my sister's visiting and I think she's asleep on the couch.
You're sister? You're sister's asleep on the couch? Ohhh! I saw her with you on the subway and now she's asleep on the couch!
Oh, I thought I heard you.
Oh hey, great, you're up. Rachel, this is my sister Krista. Krista, this is Rachel.
Hi!
Nice to meet you. I wish you'd told me we were having company, I'd fix myself up!
Like it would help.
You are so bad!
You are!
You are!
You are!
You are!
You are!
You are!
You are so dead! I'm gonna get you.
Uh, it was very nice meeting you.
Nobody! Nobody respects the bucket! You wouldn't believe what people put in here! Look! Okay, does this look like a garbage can to you?
No.
Does it look like an ashtray?
No.
Does it look like a urinal?
Eww!!
So Pheebs, are you gonna go back out there or what?
Well, yeah! But I'm not gonna take anymore crap. Okay? No more Mrs. Nice Bucket!
Yeah, good for you. Y'know you're tough, you lived on the streets.
Yeah, I'm gonna go back to being Street Phoebe. Yeah! Oh but, y'know what? I can't go totally back because Street Phoebe really wouldn't be friends with you guys. Sorry.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey, umm, can I ask you guys something?
Sure.
Uh, I don't have any brothers so I don't know, but uh, did you guys wrestle?
Oh-oh, yeah.
All the time. In fact, I was undefeated.
Uh, you weighted 200 pounds.
Still, I was quick as a cat.
Well, I met Danny's sister yesterday, and uh that was actually the girl on the subway.
Oh, you're kidding.
Yeah, they were very y'know...wrestley. But, I guess that's normal?
We don't, we don't wrestle now.
Yeah, not since I got too strong for you.
Too strong for me?
Yeah.
You wanna go right now? 'Cause I'll take you right now, buddy! You wanna go?
Oh fine.
Ready? Wrestle!
Okay, y'know what uh, actually, that's great. That helps a lot. Thanks.
Guys, come on! Let's go! The puck drops in 20 minutes! Come on, Joe!
Joey's not going.
I didn't finish my five pages.
Well, why can't you do them tomorrow?
Because tomorrow he's redoing yesterday's pages.
Yesterday's pages did not reflect my best work.
Why don't you cut him a little slack? Okay? Maybe if he relaxes a little bit, he'll get some work done.
I think he's been relaxing enough, thanks to you and Fireball.
Dude, if you think Fireball's relaxing, you've obviously have never played.
The only reason you're doing this to Joey is because you're bored. Okay, it's not his fault that you're unemployed.
I am not unemployed. I'm on sabbatical!
Come on look guys, don't fight.
And the reason I'm doing this is because I am Joey's friend. And if you were a good friend, you'd be doing the same thing.
Oh, so being a good friend means acting like a total jerk?
If it does? Then you're an amazing friend of mine.
Hey-hey guys, hey! How about we settle this over a friendly game of Fireball? Huh? I'll go unhook the smoke detectors!
How about we settle this right now! There! Now, no one's going to the game. Ha-ha-ha!
I paid for those tickets!
No you didn't. You said you would, but you never did!
Oh yeah!
...so we finally get to the top of the mountain and airhead here forgets the camera!
Oh, y'know the same thing happened to me one time.
When did that happen to you?!
Don't you remember when we were jogging in the park and we saw that really pretty bird and wanted to take a picture-I didn't have my camera!
Oh yeah. First off all, chasing the Churo guy isn't jogging.
Oh, this is so good you have got to try it.
Oh, damn! I got it on my pants.
Here, I'll get it.
We'd better take these pants off upstairs or that stain's gonna set.
Yep. I'm gonna wear these on our date tonight.
Oh, great!
Okay, bye! Oh my God!!
That was unbelievable!
Okay, see? I told you!
Yeah, wow, sorry Rach.
I don't believe they're brother and sister.
They're brother and sister!!!
Oh whoa-whoa-whoa! Wait a minute, open up your hand; let me take a look. Quarter. Dime. Lint? Not interested in that. What's this? A Canadian coin? Get outta here!
Whoa-whoa-whoa! No drinks near the bucket! Set it down over there and then you can make a contribution! And you can leave the hurt bunny look over there too! Hi Bob! I thought I told you to get outta here!
Uh, Phoebe we've been getting complaints and uh, we're gonna move you to a less high-profile spot.
What?!
Umm, Ginger's gonna take over this corner.
That chick can't handle my corner.
Look, either you leave, or we remove you.
Fine. All right, I'll give you one pointer. Look out for that bitch.
Oh, hey Rach! I thought we said seven?
Yeah uh, y'know what uh, let's skip it.
What?! Why?!
Umm, you-you and your sister seem to have umm, a very special bond, and...
Oh great! That special bond again! Why do women have such a problem with the fact that I'm close with my sister?
Well, okay, look. I don't know, listen, I don't know what's going on here but let's...
Do-do you, do you have brothers?
No, I have two sisters. But one of them has a very masculine energy.
Are you close with them?
No-no, they're not very nice people.
Okay, listen, I really like you. Okay? I think this can go somewhere. So what if I'm close to my family, are you gonna let that stand in the way of us?
Well, uh, I-I don't know. See when-when you put it that way y'know it does sort of...
Danny! Hurry up! The bath is getting cold!
What?
Yeah, okay, I'll see you later.
Oh hey! There's some kids playing in the street, you wanna go down there and give them a project, ruin their day?
Hey, if they have a ball maybe you can stick razor blades in it and teach them a new game, Gonna Need Stitches Ball.
Hey guys! I was at the library all morning and I already finished my five pages for today!
Yay!
Great! Now, we can go to the Ranger game! Last night!
No dude, Ross tore up the tickets!
I guess when you don't have so many distractions, it's easier for you to focus. Huh?
Yeah or also when you don't have somebody breathing down your neck ALL THE LIVE LONG DAY!!
Yeah, well, that's fine, but the important thing is that I finished it. And uh, I think it's really good, but y'know it'd really help me is if I could hear it. So would you guys read it for me?
All right.
All right.
Okay. "It's a typical New York City apartment. Two guys are hanging out." Ross
Hey man.
What is up?
About yesterday, I was really wrong. I am sorry.
No, it was me. I'm sorry. I over reacted.
Maybe it was both of us, but we had our best friend's interest... But we had our best friend's interest at heart.
Could I be more sorry.
I don't know, I'm one sorry polentologist. All right Joey, we get it. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry too.
Oh no! No-no, keep reading! The good part's coming up. Keep going.
I am sorry, Chandler.
I am sorry, Ross.
A handsome man enters. Hey! How's it going guys? I don't know what you two were talking about, but I'd like to say thanks to both of you. You, you wouldn't let me give up on myself, and you well you co-created Fireball. The end.
This took you all day?!
No-no, this only took five minutes. I spent the rest of the day coming up with new, Ultimate Fireball. Ha-ha!
Okay, it's a typical New York City apartment. Two girls are just hanging out.
Hi, how are you doing Kelly?
I'm doing just fine! God, Tiffany, you smell so great!
It's my new perfume. Why don't you come closer where you can really appreciate it?
Oh, y'know Joey, you are sick!
This is disgusting!
I'm not reading this!
What?! Wait-wait-wait! The handsome man was about to enter!!
Is there any entertainment there? What are people doing?
All right! Here we go! 1999! The year of Joey!
We're very happy for you.
What's the matter?!
We wanted to kiss at midnight, but nobody else is going to so y'know...
All right, I'll take care of it.
Oh no, wait! Joey!
73! 72! 71!
Ross! Ross! Ross, listen! Who are you kissing at midnight, huh? Rachel or Phoebe?
What?
Well you gotta kiss someone, you can't kiss your sister.
Well, who's gonna kiss my sister.
Chandler.
Awww, man! Really?
Dude-dude, who would you rather have kiss your sister, me or Chandler?
That's a good point.
Yeah.
Oh well, since I have that whole history with Rachel, I guess Phoebe.
Okay, great!
All right.
Pheebs! Pheebs! Ross wants to kiss you at midnight!
It's so obvious, why doesn't he just ask?
Rach! Rach! Listen, I'm gonna kiss you at midnight.
What?!
Well, everyone's gotta kiss someone. You can't kiss Ross you got the history.
So?
So? Who would you rather have kiss you, me or Chandler?
Oh, good point.
Yeah!
3! 2! 1! HAPPY NEW YEAR!!
Happy New Year!
Happy New Year.
Happy New Year, Pheebs!
You too!
Happy New Year, Joey!
So did that do anything for ya?
Y'know what? I'm gonna go out on a limb and say no divorces in '99!
But your divorce isn't even final yet.
Just the one divorce in '99! Y'know what, I am gonna be happy this year. I am gonna make myself happy.
Do you want us to leave the room, or?
Everyday I am gonna do one thing that I haven't done before. That my friends is my New Year's resolution.
Ooh! That's a good one! Mine is to pilot a commercial jet.
That's good one too, Pheebs. Now all you have to do is find a planeload of people who's resolution is to plummet to their deaths.
Maybe your resolution is to not make fun of your friends, especially the ones who may soon be flying you to Europe for free on their own plane.
She has a better chance of sprouting wings and flying up your nose than you do of not making fun of us.
In fact, I'll bet you 50 bucks that you can't go the whole year without making fun of us. Eh, y'know what, better yet? A week.
I'll take that bet my friend. And you know what, paying me the 50 bucks could be the "new thing you do that day!" And it starts right now!
All right, my New Year's resolution is to learn how to play the guitar.
Ohh.
Really?! How come?
Well, y'know those special skills I have listed on my resume? I would love it would be great if one of those was true.
Do you want me to teach you? I'm a great teacher.
Really? Who-who have you taught?
Well, I taught me and I love me.
Yeah that'd be great! Thanks Pheebs!
Op, look! Claire forgot her glasses! And she's gonna be really needing these to keep an eye on that boyfriend, who, I hear, needs to keep his stapler in his desk drawer, if you know what I'm talking about.
Hey Rach, maybe your resolution should be to umm, gossip less.
I don't gossip!
Well, maybe sometimes I find out things or I hear something and I pass that information on y'know kinda like a public service, it doesn't mean I'm a gossip. I mean, would you call Ted Kopel a gossip?
Well if Ted Kopel talked about his coworkers botched boob jobs, I would.
What? They were like this!
I'll see you tomorrow.
Okay! Hey!
Hey!
I just asked that girl out.
Nice!
Nice!! Yeah! Is that part of your resolution, your new thing for today?
Yes it is. See.
Elizabeth Hornswoggle?
That's right, uh, Elizabeth Hornswoggle.
Horn-swoggle.
You all right Chandler? Is there something funny about that name?
No. No, I just think that maybe I-I'd heard it somewhere before.
Oh really! Where? Somewhere funny I'd bet!
Hi, Pheebs!
Hey!
Oh-oh, guess what? I-I have a date with Elizabeth Hornswoggle.
Hornswoggle? Ooh, this must be killing you.
All right, see you later.
See ya! All right Pheebs, I am ready for my first lesson.
Okay. Oh no-no-no, you don't touch the guitar! First you learn here, then you learn here.
Umm, okay.
Okay, Lesson One: Chords. Now, I Don'T Know The Actual Names Of The Chords But Umm, I-I-I Made Up Names For The Way My Hand Looks While I'M Doing Them. So then, this is Bear Claw. Okay, umm, Turkey Leg and Old Lady.
What an interesting approach to guitar instruction. Y'know some might find it amusing, I myself find it regular.
Hey everybody, Rachel was so good today. She didn't gossip at all.
I didn't! Even when I found out...umm, all right, well let's just say I found something out something about someone and let's just say she's gonna keep it.
Hey, Pheebs! Check-check this out.
Ooh, you nailed the Old Lady!
Yeah listen so, I thought I was getting better, so on my way home today I stopped by this guitar store and...
Did you, did you touch any of the guitars while you were there? Did you?!
No.
Give me your hands. Strings. Gimme it! Pick. Do you want to learn to play guitar?
Yes!
Then don't touch one!!
Hi!
Hi!
Hi Ben!
Auntie Monica!!
Ross is wearing leather pants! Does nobody else see that Ross is wearing leather pants? Someone comment on the pants!
I think they're very nice.
I like 'em.
Yeah!
I like them a lot.
That's not what I had in mind! See, people like Ross don't generally wear these types of pants. You see, they're very tight. Maybe there's something in that area.
Oh see, I-I needed a new thing for today and there's this leather store that always smells so good and I thought to myself, "Wow, I never really owned a good smelling pair of pants before."
Oh come on!!
Okay, seriously, what do you think?
You look like a freak.
Awful, absolutely awful.
What are you, what are you doing?
It's my New Year's resolution!
What, to blind my child?
No! To take more pictures of all of us together. I mean I really think it's the best resolution because everyone will enjoy the pictures.
Well, everyone will enjoy my music as well.
My God! These pants are burning up! Oh come on, she wants to snuggle now! What is she trying to kill me? It's like a volcano in here! Are you hot?
No.
Okay, it must just be me then.
That was just the pants on the couch. Umm, hey, do you, do you mind if I use your bathroom?
No, go ahead.
Thanks.
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh..........
Hey, my favorite part is coming up!
'Kay!
Oh my God!
Tiger! Dragon! Iceberg!! Joseph, did you even study at all last night?
Yes! Yes, I did.
Then do Iceberg!
G-sharp.
G-sharp? Have you been studying the real names of the chords? Have you? Oh my God!
What?! I didn't touch a guitar!
No, but you're questioning my method!
No, I'm not questioning it, I'm saying it's stupid! What?!
Thank you.
Y'know none of my other student thought I was stupid.
Your other student, was you!
Yeah, well, y'know maybe you just need to try a little harder!
Look, maybe I need to try a real teacher! Right here! Here! Andy Cooper, he teaches guitar and look ooh, there's a nice picture of him with a little kid and THE KID'S GOT A GUITAR!!!!!!
Fine! You go learn from your qualified instructor! But don't come crying to me when everyone's sick and tired of hearing you play Bad, Bad Leroy Brown!!
"Baddest man in the whole damn town."
Oh, fine! Take his side!
I can't wait to be with you! I'll sneak over as soon as Ross picks up Ben. I'll just tell Rachel I'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours.
Laundry. Huh. Is that my new nickname?
Awww, y'know what your nickname is, Mr. Big...
Arghh!!
Hello?
Joey, it's Ross! I need some help!
Uhh, Chandler's not here.
Well, you can help me!
Okay.
Listen, I'm in Elizabeth's bathroom...
Nice!
No, I-I got really hot in my leather pants so I took them off but they must have shrunk from the-the sweat or-or-or my legs expanded from the heat. Look, I-I can't put them back on. I can't!
Oh. That is quite a situation. Uh, do you see any like, powder?
Powder! Yeah! Yeah, I have powder!
Good-good, okay, sprinkle some of that on your legs, it'll absorb some of the moisture and then you can get your pants back up.
Yeah, okay, hold on! They're not coming on man.
Umm, do you see any-oh, Vaseline?
Ohh, I-I see lotion, I have lotion! Will that work?
Yeah, sure, spread some of that on there.
Hold on.
Ross? You okay?
They're still, they're still not coming on man and the lotion and the powder have made a paste!
Really?! Uhh, what color is it?
What difference does that make?!
Well, I'm just-if the paste matches the pants, you can make yourself a pair of paste pants and she won't know the difference!
Joey, do you have a minute?
Dude, what am I gonna...
Uh, Rachel's here, so good luck man, let me know how it works out.
Oh, Joey, I have such a problem!
Oh well, you're timing couldn't be better. I am putting out fires all over the place.
Okay. Okay. Okay. Joey, I have got to tell you something!
What-what is it, what is it?
Oh my God, it's so huge, but you just have to promise me that you cannot tell anyone.
Oh no, no-no-no-no! I don't want to know!
Yes! Yes! Yes, you do want to know! This is unbelievable!
I don't care, Rach! Look, I am tired of being the guy who knows all the secrets but can't tell anyone!
What? What secrets? You know secrets? What are they?
And you're not supposed to be gossiping!!
I know, I know! I just can't keep this one in, so I pick up the phone...
I'm not listening to you!
Ross, umm, you've been in there for a long time. I'm starting to get kinda freaked out.
All right, I'm coming out. Hey, can you turn the lights off.
No, let's just leave the lights on.
Oh my God!
I had a problem.
Hey, Pheebs?
No, I can't talk to you! I don't have a fancy ad in the Yellow Pages!
Look, Pheebs, I just, I wanna apologize for, for saying that your method was stupid and-and maybe ask you to be my teacher again. And-and I promise, I won't touch a guitar until you say I'm ready. You really think I'm ready?
Uh-huh!
Wow! Cool!
Was the chord at least right...
No!
Oh my God!
We heard about your pants, I'm so sorry.
This year was supposed to be great! But, it's only the second day and I'm a loser with stupid leather pants that don't even fit!
No. No, you're not a loser.
Look at me!
Hey, hey, look. Look Ross, Ben drew a picture of you! Huh? You're-you're a cowboy!
Oh, be-because of the leather pants.
See? Ben doesn't think you're a loser, he thinks you're a cowboy! Now that's something.
Yeah!
That really is something; that's really cool.
Howdy partner!
Maybe I should get another pair! Ooh, y'know, they-they had some with fringe all down the sides. I'm gonna go kiss Ben goodnight. I can't believe he thinks I'm a cowboy. I would make a good cowboy.
Okay, now that everything's wrapped up here, I think I'm, I'm gonna go do my laundry.
Oh yeah, me too. Y'know if this shirt is dirty. Yep.
Okay, I'm gonna go too. I'm gonna go to the airport. I figure if I hang around there long enough, someone's bound to leave one of those planes unattended.
Good luck, honey!
Bye!
Hey, uh, Joey?
Umm?
Remember that big thing I was gonna tell you about?
Oh, no!
I'm not gonna tell you, but if you found out on your own, that would be okay and then we could talk about it. Right?
Well, then it wouldn't be a secret. So yeah, that would be okay. Yeah. Yeah!
Yeah. Well. Hey uh Joe, would mind going over to Chandler's bedroom and get that book back that he borrowed from me?
Now? You want me to go over there now?
Yeah!
Do you know something?
Do you know something?
I might know something.
I might know something too.
What's the thing you know?
Oh no, I can't tell you until you tell me what you know.
I can't tell you what I know.
Well then I can't tell you what I know.
Okay, fine.
You don't know!
All right, how about I go over there and I will walk into Chandler's bedroom and I will see that thing that I think that I know is actually the thing that I think that I know!
YOU KNOW!!!!
AND YOU KNOW!!!
Yeah, I know!!!!
Chandler and Monica?!! Oh, this is unbelievable!! How long have you known?
Too long! Oh my God, Rach, I've been dying to talk to someone about this for so long! Listen, listen, we can't say anything about this to anybody, they're so weird about that! Listen...
Hey!
Hey! It's raining. I don't want to fly in the rain. So...
Oh, I am going to go for a walk in the rain.
Ohhh, yeah, me too.
That's weird. I bet they're doing it.
Oh good, okay, I can't take it anymore. I can't take it anymore. So you win, okay? Here! Pheebs? Flying a jet? Better make it a spaceship so that you can get back to your home planet! And Ross, phone call for you today, Tom Jones, he wants his pants back! And Hornswoggle? What are you dating a character from Fraggile Rock?!
Come on Joey!!!
Rach, I told you everything I knew last night! Look, it's not that big of a deal, so Monica and Chandler are doing it.
I can't believe you would say that!
Sorry. Monica and Chandler are making love.
No! I mean come on! This is a huge deal! Fine I want-I need more details, who-who initiated the first kiss?
I don't know.
Is he romantic with her?
I don't know.
Are they in love?
I don't know.
You don't know anything.
Ohh, I know one thing!
What?
They did it right there on the couch.
Hey Ross!
Hey!
Hey-yeah. Hey Gunther, can I have a scone please? Wanna hear some good news? Someone I know is getting married! Yeah! And weddings are happy occasions! Oh, by-the-by it's my ex-wife Emily!
What? Oh!
Sorry man.
Here's your scone.
Oh, thanks Gunther. STUPID BRITISH SNACK FOOD!!!!!!!
Did they teach you that in your anger management class?
Hey, you know what might help you deal with it? Think of it this way, you and Emily are in the past and you can't be mad about the past. So are you still mad about the Louisiana Purchase?
Pheebs, I don't think anyone's mad about that.
Exactly! Because it's in the past!
Anybody gonna eat that?
Look at us all dressed up for the big office party! By the way, what are we celebrating?
Oh, we had a lot of liquor left over from the Christmas party.
I think this is so cool because none of our friends are here and we can be a real couple. We don't have to hide.
I know, I can do this.
Ooh, and I can do this.
We can't do that.
Hey Bing! Wo-ho-ho, who's the pretty lady and what the hell is she doing with you?
I asked myself that very question, sir. Uh, this is Monica. This is my boss, Doug. Doug this is Monica.
Hi, nice to meet you!
Hi! And this is my wife Kara.
Nice to meet you Monica. Bing!
Say uh, Bing, did you hear about the new law firm we got working for us?
No, sir.
Yeah, Dewey, Cheatum, and Howe.
Come on honey, let's go drink our body weight.
What was that?
What?
That noise you just made?
Oh, that was my work laugh.
Really? Your work laugh?
Oh, believe me, to survive this party, you're gonna have to come up with one too.
All right, check me out.
Okay.
...says $30 Father; same as in town.
Hey! Everybody at work loved you last night!
Really?
And! They like me more just because I was with ya! I think you repaired a lot of the damage from when they met Joey. And Doug wants us to play tennis with them. He's never even talked to me outside of work. Except for that time when we bumped into each other at that strip club. Strip church. Anyway, I'm gonna go try and find a racquet.
Hey, I thought you already had one.
Oh I used too, but then Joey thought it would be fun to go to Central Park and hit rocks at...bigger rocks. Hey Rach, do you have a tennis racquet?
Oh umm, y'know I lent it to Joey and I never actually got it back.
Okay, good luck with that.
Hey!
Hi!
What's up?!
What are you doing here? I thought you had to do inventory all day.
Well yeah, I do, but I decided to take a long lunch and spend some time with my friend Monica. Y'know I-I feel that we don't talk anymore. How are you? What is new with you?
Uhh, not much. Uh, work's good.
Oh y'know what, we don't have to talk about work. We can talk about anything!
Okay. Umm...
Hey! Y'know what? Let's talk about relationships!
Okay, what's going on with you?
Nothing! You go!
Well, I-I-there was this guy at the bank that I thought was cute umm, but I don't anymore.
Wow that's uh, juicy. Umm, y'know what though Mon, I actually do have a lot of work to do so if-if-are you sure there's just not anything else?
Yes, I'm sure! Rachel is there something that you want to talk me about?
No! If there was I wouldn't tell you.
Okay, then what happened?
Ohh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. You'll get your turn!
Hey Pheebs, what's going on?
Nothing! This is not over!
No! No! No!
What?!
I was up all night writing this really nasty letter to Emily! It was perfect and now it's all covered in-in... Actually, thanks!
All right! Everybody ready to go to the movies?
Uh actually, I think I'm gonna skip it.
Really?
Yeah, I'm gonna stay and read my book. I just wanna be alone right now.
Oh. Are you sure you don't want to come? Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan, they get mail and stuff.
That's okay, Joe.
All right, let's go Pheebs.
Oh God!
Bing!
Oww!!
Game!
Well, I gotta tell ya Bing; that partner of yours is a real tiger. Are you all right sweethart?
I'm not all right.
We're, we're just gonna get a little sip of water.
Am I on fire today or what?! Those birds are browned, basted, and ready to be carved!
Okay, easy Martina. I think we should let them win the next game.
I'm sorry, I don't understand what you just said.
Let them win one.
Are you crazy?! We own those two! I mean look at 'um, he can't breath and she's popping pills.
You're not even giving them a chance!
They have racquets don't they?!
Uh Bing, I think we're gonna make this the last game.
Oh yes, sir! Put me out of my misery. Are you sure you never played pro? Please let them win!
I'll take it down to 95% but that's the best I can do.
Oopsey, missed it!
I got it!
Nice shot.
I got it!!
Long!
I can't believe you let them win!
Yeah, at least you hid your feelings well about it.
I was frustrated.
It was my racquet.
I was frustrated with you!
If we hadn't lost the game they never would've invented us to dinner tomorrow night.
Y'know what really bothers me? Is-it's how-how different you act around them! I mean y'know the throwing the tennis games, the fake laugh, the "I'll see you around, Bing!" "Not if I see you first, Doug!" I gotta tell you, I don't like Work Chandler. Okay? The guy's a suck-up.
Okay y'know what, because you said that, I'm not putting out tonight.
I'm telling you, something's wrong! My brother does not stay out all night.
Maybe we should check the trash chute.
Ross couldn't fit down the trash chute.
That's right, he almost could. Which is exactly how I got stuck there.
Hey!
There he is!
Oh my God! Where the hell have you been?!!
Just, y'know out.
Ohh, out, oh God, I don't know why we didn't think to check there!
What were you doing?
I uh, went to a bar. And then I just uh, just walked around for a while.
You walked around all night in the city by yourself?
He hooked up! He hooked up with someone.
Look, I don't have to answer your questions! Okay? I'm a big boy, I can do whatever I want!
He hooked up!! Tell us about her!
Ross you left you scarf in... Hey you guys.
Uh-oh-okay. Uh-oh-okay. I know what you all are thinking. But Chandler is in Yemen! I'm a young woman! I have needs! I can't wait forever!
Yeah! No that's what I was thinking.
So I'm asking you please, take a moment before you judge me.
Oh, nobody's judging you.
Oh! Okay! You, Mister Right Place at the Right Time, call me!
Okay, look, I-I know what you guys are going to say...
You two will have very hairy children.
Okay, I didn't know you would say that.
Ross! Janice?!
All right, hold on! Hold on. Hold on. This is Ross, okay? He's our friend. He obviously went crazy. He obviously lost his mind.
Look, I didn't lose my mind! Okay, Janice and I have a lot in common! We've-we've both been divorced. We-we both have kids.
So are you actually gonna see her again?
Phoebe! Don't put ideas in his head!
I am gonna see her again.
Damnit Phoebe!!
Okay, I have to tell you something that I have never admitted during our entire friendship! But, when we were in high school I made out with James Farrell even when I knew that you liked him! Wow, that feels so good to get off my chest! Okay, you go!
My turn? What-what are you talking about?
Ugh, Monica, I know about you and Chandler.
What?!
I overheard you guys on the phone the other day, and you said, "I'll just tell Rachel that I'm doing laundry for a couple of hours." And he said, "Laundry? Is that my new nickname?" And you said, "No! You know what your nickname is, Mr. Big."
Well. Sounds like you're writing yourself a little play there Rach. Wow! Let me know how that one turns out.
Well, I wouldn't know because I got so freaked out that I hung up the phone.
Well, if you had kept listening, you-you would have heard me call him Mr. Big......ot.
What?!
Mr. Bigot. He tells the most racist jokes.
All right. So you're telling me that there is nothing going on between you and Chandler.
Me and Chandler?!
All right, put your 20 bucks down. First one to find the tasty treat wins. Okay?
Uh-hmm.
All right. Let's get the contestants out of their isolation booths. And they're off!
Get your foot off my contestant! Judge!
Judge rules, no violation.
Ohhh.
Hey guys!
Hey!
Yeah!
Y'know what? It sounds so weird to say this but, I just had a great day with Janice!
What?!
Are you serious?!
Yeah! I opened up to her about all the terrible stuff that's been happening to me. I mean I talked for hours. It is amazing to have someone give you such-such focused attention.
You don't need Janice for that, you've got us. We...
And the duck gets the Nutter-Butter!
No!! Hey-hey that's not a Nutter-Butter, that's just an old Wonton!
Judge rules, Nutter-Butter.
Ohh, tough call.
Yeah.
But seriously, I believe that we should all support President Clinton. And her husband Bill.
So how do you kids like your coffee?
Oh, none for me. Thanks.
Just a little bit of sugar.
Well, maybe I'll bring it out and have Monica stick her finger in it. That oughta sweeten it up, huh?
How does that laugh not give you a headache?
Oh, you get used to it.
Y'know, I-I-I don't think that I can. So if you don't mind, maybe this will be it for me on the work things.
So I laugh at my boss's jokes, what's the big deal?
I'd rather hang out with a sniveling work weasel guy when I can be hanging out with my boyfriend who I actually respect.
Oh.
Uh, I gotta apologize for Kara's coffee. Y'know, I feel sorry for it if it ever got in a fight, it's not strong enough to defend itself. Did you hear what I said Bing?
What?
The joke Bing. What's the matter with you?
Well, I-I just didn't think it was funny sir.
Excuse me?
Well, I just...
Honey, I just don't think that you understood the joke.
Really?
Yeah! I mean it was really funny, I-I just don't think you got it. You see Kara's coffee is-is-is weak tasting, okay? But-but what Doug was-was imply that it was weak physically. You get it now honey?
I think I do! Thank you, Monica.
I thought you could use the help.
Coffee in a fight!
Hey Rach! Hey, you mind if I read my comic books in here?
Sure! Why?
Oh well, Chandler and Monica are over there and it's kinda hard to concentrate.
What?! She just called and said that she was gonna be working late! She keeps lying to me! That's it! Y'know what? I'm just gonna go over there and confront them right now!
All right, so you're telling me that I have to tell racist jokes now?!
Sorry! I'm just-I'm not very good at this! I'm a terrible liar and I hate having to lie to Rachel!
But we're not ready to tell yet!
I know! It's just that...ever since high school Rachel was the one person I told everything too. Y'know? I miss that so much now. She's my best friend.
Joey?! Oh my God, Rachel!
Hey! Hi!
Wh-wh-what are you doing here?
Well, I was actually-I-I came over here to-to borrow this lamp. To umm, look at my books, y'know, see them a little better.
Okay great!
Yeah!
Great! Umm, well what-what I was doing in Chandler's room is that umm, I was cleaning it! In fact, he pays me to clean it!
Oh! What a great way to earn some extra pocket money.
Y'know when I said to you earlier that I was at work umm, I'm at my new work.
That's good enough. Right? Okay, well umm, I'm gonna go look at my books!
Okay.
Okay.
I'll get back to my new job.
'Kay. Congratulations on your new job.
Man, she is really gullible.
Here you go.
Thanks!
Actually, I should get going.
Are you sure? Because I can stay out as late as you want. I told you how I'm on sabbatical from work, right?
Yes! Yes! You did!
Oh...
What is wrong now?!
This isn't what I ordered! Man! Can anything go right in my life?! First my marriage falls apart and then...
I know! I know! And then you lose your apartment! And then you lose your job! And then your ex-wife gets married so fast! And now the coffee-ahh!! Ross, we need to talk.
Okay. Sometimes I feel...
No-no-no, no. I'm going to talk. I believe that the sun has set on our day in the sun.
Huh?
You're a very sweet person Ross, umm, unfortunately I don't think I can take another second of you whining!!
Let-let me make sure I'm hearing this right, you're ending this with me because I'm too whiney? So you're saying, I've become so whiney that I annoy you, Janice.
Well yeah!!
OH...MY...GOD!!
Are you gonna be okay?
I am now.
Okay.
Umm, hi.
Oh hi! Well, I guess that's two out of three, Joey.
Dude, we got to talk.
Okay.
I just wanted to tell you something before you heard it from someone else and I hope this isn't too weird, but uh, I had uh, a thing with Janice. What you're-you're not mad?
Why would I be mad?
Well, because y'know there are certain rules about this kind of stuff. You don't uh, you don't fool around with your uh, friend's ex-girlfriends or possible girlfriends or girls they're related to.
I am mad! But you know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna forgive you! Because that's what friends do! They forgive their friends when they do everything you just said, all on the list there. Well, but I want you to remember that I forgave you.
Okay.
I also want you to remember that I let you live here rent free!
All right.
And, I want you to remember that I gave you twenty seven dollars. No strings attached. Now, if you can't remember that, I think we should write it down-let's write it down!
I can't believe we've never done this before! It's sooo good! So good for Monica!
Oh! Look at that, time's up! My turn!
That was a half an hour?
It's your timer.
Y'know, I don't like to brag about it, but I give the best massages!
All right, then massage me up right nice!
Ah! Ahh!! Ahh!!
It's so good, isn't it?
It's so good I don't know what I've done to deserve it!
Say good-bye to sore muscles!
Good-bye muscles!!
I'm telling you, she gives the worst massages ever!! Okay, it was like she was torturing me for information. And I wanted to give it up I just-I didn't know what it was!
Chandler, if it really hurts that bad you should just tell her.
Look, for the first time in my life I'm in a real relationship. Okay, I'm not gonna screw that up by y'know, telling the truth.
Hey.
Whoa, dude, look out! You almost crushed my hat!
Sorry.
And the bunny got away.
This would be the place where you explain the hat.
Oh! Yeah, look there's this play all right? And I'm up for the part of this real cool like suave international guy. A real clothes horse. So I figure that everyone at the audition is gonna be wearing this kinda y'know, ultra-hip, high fashion stuff.
And you're gonna make them all disappear.
Yeah, like you could find something as sophisticated as this.
Done.
Joey, if you wanna look good, why don't you just come down to the store? I'll help you out.
Great! Thanks, Rach!
Sure! God, please take those off!
All right.
Hey Pheebs, how's it going?
Hey.
Hey! Umm, well, only okay because I just got back from, from the hospital.
What?
Is everything okay?
Are you all right?
Oh yeah, no-no-no. I'm fine. I'm okay, but umm, my Grandma sorta died.
Pheebs! Sorry!
It's okay, I mean she had a really incredible life. And it's not like I'm never gonna see her again, y'know she's gonna visit.
Well maybe, maybe she's with us right now?
Yeah, her first day on a new spiritual plane and she's gonna come to the coffeehouse!
Guys! Guys! I just saw two people having sex in a car right outside.
Uhh, Pheebs' Grandmother just died.
Ohh my God, I'm so sorry.
It's okay. Actually y'know what, it's kinda cool. 'Cause it's like y'know, one life ends and another begins.
Not the way they're doing it. What, what happened? How did she die?
Well umm, okay we were in the market and she bent down to get some yogurt and she just never came back up again.
Pheebs, I'm so sorry.
It was really sweet. The last thing she said to me was; "Okay dear, you go get the eggs and I'm gonna get the yogurt and we'll meet at the checkout counter." And y'know what? We will meet at the checkout counter.
Okay now Joey, y'know that since you're returning all of this stuff right after the audition you're gonna have to wear underwear?
All right, then you'd better show me some of that too then.
Okay, it's missing something. Ooh, I know! Umm, okay.
Really? A purse?
It's not a purse! It's a shoulder bag.
It looks like a women's purse.
No Joey, look. Trust me, all the men are wearing them in the spring catalog. Look. See look, men, carrying the bag.
See look, women, carrying the bag. But it is odd how a women's purse looks good on me, a man.
Exactly! Unisex!
Maybe you need sex. I had sex a couple days ago.
No! No Joey! U-N-I-sex.
Well, I ain't gonna say no to that.
Who is it?
It's Phoebe.
Oh great! Oh, you. Umm, what's up?
Umm, well I sorta have some bad news, can I come in?
Umm, yeah-no thanks.
Umm, well, umm Grandma died.
Wow! Didn't she die like five years ago?
No, she just died today! Okay, umm, we're having a memorial service tomorrow.
Okay, I know that I went to that all ready.
No you didn't!
Well, then who's been dead for five years?
Well, lots of people! Look, are you coming to memorial service or not?
Umm, no. See I already thought she was dead so I kinda made my peace with it. Plus, I'm going to a concert tomorrow. So... I'd invite you, but umm, I only have two tickets left.
Fine. Okay, enjoy your concert.
Thanks! Enjoy your funeral.
Hey!
Hey!
Wow! You look just like your son Mrs. Tribbiani!
What? Are you referring to my man's bag? At first, I thought it just looked good, but it's practical too. Check it out! It's got compartments for all your stuff! Your wallet! Your keys! Your address book!
Your make-up!
Joey, what are you doing with the bag? You're audition is not until tomorrow.
Yeah, but sandwich time is right now.
Joey, y'know you get any mustard on that bag, you can't return it.
Why would I return it? I love this bag!
All right, then you owe me $350.
Fine! Do you take Vasa or Mustercard?
Joey...
All right relax, look I'll pay you with the money from the acting job I am definitely gonna get thanks to you.
What's the part, Anti-man?
Hey, don't listen to them. I think it's sexy.
U-N-I-sexy?
Well hello, Mrs. Penella! Thank you so much for coming! Well, okay look, here's your umm, 3-D glasses and Reverend Pong will tell you when to put them on.
Hi sweetie!
Hey, how are you holding up?
Hey Pheebs, I'm so sorry.
Hey, y'know what? My Grandma had the exact same bag!
Here, I brought you some flowers.
Thanks!
Pulling flowers out it makes the bag look a lot more masculine.
Oops, I'm sorry. Excuse me. Is this the umm, the memorial?
Yeah, welcome.
Hello. Hello.
Umm here's your 3-D glasses.
Oh, umm, all right.
So how did you know Francis?
Well I actually, I-I really, I haven't seen her for years. But umm, well I-I was pretty tight with-with her and her daughter.
Really?! What's your name?
Umm, Frank Buffay.
Y'know what? Strike that. My name uh, actually is-is Joe. Uh, Joe umm, Hill.
You're Frank Buffay?
Shh! No! Joe Hill!
You just said...
Y'know what, I gotta go. And thank you so much for coming.
But...
Oh my God!
What?! What honey?
What happened?
That was my dad!
Oh my God!
Hey you guys, check it out. Check it out. It's like it's coming right at me.
Oh, did you catch him?!
Uh-huh.
Wh-what did he say?!
He said, "Nice to meet you Glenda." Well, obviously I couldn't give him my real name?
Why?! Why not?!
Come on, you saw the way he ran out of here! What do you think? He's gonna stick around and talk to the daughter he abandoned!
What did you say to him?
Well, I said, I told him y'know, that I was the executor person of Francis' will and that I needed to talk to him so I'm gonna meet him at the coffee house later.
Could everyone please take their seats?
All right, well, I just can't think about that right now. I just wanna say good-bye to my Grandma.
Okay.
All right, let's go say good-bye.
Hey! I'm off to my audition. How do I look?
Ahhh, I think you look great! That bag is gonna get you that part.
And a date with a man!
Y'know what? Make fun all you want. This is a great bag! Okay? And it's as handy as it is becoming. Now, just because you don't understand something, doesn't make it wrong. All right? So from now on you guys are gonna have to get used to the fact that Joey, comes with a bag!
All right, I'd better go too. I have to go talk to my dad.
Ooh, Pheebs, what are you gonna say? Are you gonna tell him who you are?
Umm, no, not at first 'cause I-I don't want to freak him out
Well, but aren't you pissed at him?! I mean this guy abandoned you! I gotta tell you if this were me, this guy would be in some serious physical danger! I mean I-I-I'd walk in there and I'd be like, "Yo, dad! You and me outside right now!" I kinda scared myself.
Well, at least you scared someone.
Y'know it's funny, you'd think I'd be angry. I mean, you'd think I'd wanna rip his tiny little head off. Fortunately, I'm past it.
Phoebe, you do seem a little tense. Here, let me help you.
All right.
Oh! Get off!! Ow!! Oh, stop it!! Why?! Why are you doing that to me?!
What are you talking about?
As a masseuse and a human, I'm begging you, never do that to anyone!
I give good massages! I used to give them to Rachel all the time before she got allergic! And-and-and Chandler loves them! Watch!
He-he does not like it! He hates it! He's in pain!
No he's not!
Yes, he is!
What?!
I'm sorry but, ow-owww-owww!
You've been lying to me? I can't believe you'd do that.
Well, maybe he just didn't want to hurt your feelings.
But the minute we start to lie to each other... And by 'we' I mean society.
Any time you're ready, Joey.
Well, you must be new here. Why don't we get a table and I'll buy you a drink.
I'm sorry. Could you, could you try it without the purse?
Yeah, sure. Well, you must be new here. Maybe we should-I'm sorry, can I ask you something?
Sure. What?
Well, first it's not a purse.
Okay, anytime.
I mean if-if you're thinking it's a woman's bag, it's not. It's a man's bag!
Okayyyy! Anddd, go!
All right look, let me show you the catalog! See? Huh? It's the latest thing! Everyone's got one! Men! Women! Children! Everyone's carrying them!
Umm, do you sell these bags?
Noooo. No-no-no, these babies sell themselves.
Okay! Thank you! That was great!
Yeah but I didn't read anything.
I think we've seen enough!
Okay! All right, I'll see ya. We got it! We got it!
Hey, is Rachel here?
No.
Listen, I just wanted to apologize about this afternoon and the whole massage thing. Y'know? I-I really like 'em.
Oh, please, stop! Look, we're supposed to be honest with each other. I-I just wish you could tell me-just say, "I don't like your massages."
I don't like your massages.
See? It's no big deal.
Okay, but now see you're crying!
I'm not crying about that! I'm crying about something that happened at work.
What?
My boyfriend said he didn't like my massages.
It's okay, you don't have to be the best at everything.
Oh my God! You don't know me at all!
Okay, you give the worst massages in the world.
I'm crying here!!
Okay, hear me out. Okay? You give the best bad massages. If anybody was looking for the best bad massage and they were thinking to themselves, "Who's the best of that?" They'd have to go to you.
Huh. So you're saying like umm, if there was an award for the best bad massage, well who would get that?
Oh, it would be you! You! Monica! And you'd get all the votes!
So maybe they could umm, call the award the Monica?
Absolutely!
Okay. I suck!
Yeah!
Umm, thank you for meeting with me.
Thank you. All right.
Come, sit. Sit. Sit! Umm, all righty, before we get started I just-I need you to state for the official record that you are in fact Frank Buffay.
Oh yes. Yes, yes, I am, uh-hmm.
Okay.
So, what did Francis leave me?
Huh?
Well, that's why you wanted me to come, right?
Oh yes. Yes. Yeah-no. She did. She left you umm, this lipstick.
Oh. Huh. It's huh, well it's oh it's-ew used. Umm, cool.
Okay. I have just a few questions to ask so I'm going to get out my official forms. Okay, so, question 1) You and uh, you were married to Francis' daughter Lilly, is that correct?
Yes, yes I was.
Okay, umm, question 2) Umm, did that marriage end A. Happily, B. Medium, or C. In the total abandonment of her and her two children?
It really says that?!
Yeah. See?
Well then I guess then I-I would I would have to say C.
Hmm, okay, total abandonment. Okay, reasons for abandonment, A. Top secret government work, B. Amnesia, or C. Or you're just a selfish, irresponsible bad, bad man?
Y'know, I don't think I want the lipstick that much. But umm... Oh, would you do me a favor? And umm, would you, would you give Lilly that, please?
What?!
Well Lilly, when you see Lilly would you give her that, that note? Because I wanted to talk to her at the memorial but, well I pictured her getting mad at me the way you got mad at me and I well, I chickened out. So, uh, I wrote her that note, would you give it to her please?
But you-you-you came to see Lilly?
Yeah, yeah. Why?
Lilly's dead.
She what?!
She's dead.
Are you sure?
Well, if she isn't then cremating her was a big mistake.
I can't believe this. I just-I can't believe this. How-how-Oh my God. How long ago?
17 years ago.
Oh! What about, what about the girls?
Well, Ursula is a waitress and-and she lives in Soho. And Phoebe, is on this couch.
Yep, lipstick and a daughter, big day for you!
Phoebe, I-I-I-umm, Oops. I just, I-I-I-I don't, I don't know what to say. I just can't believe that you're my daughter, you're so pretty.
Yes. Well, that's neither here nor there.
So would it, would it make you feel better if I said I was very, very sorry that I left?
Y'know what, it doesn't matter what you say it's not gonna make a difference anyway, so you can just go.
All right. Well, y'know in my defense I was a lousy father.
That's a defense?
Yes. Yes it is. I burned the formula and I put your diapers on backwards. I mean, I made up a song to sing you to sleep, but that made you cry even more!
You make up songs?
Well no, just-just that one. But, it was stupid. Let's see, how did it, how did it go. Umm.
I just, I y'know, I'm not very good at this. So, umm...
Well, I am.
Not yet, no.
Hi.
Hey!
Hey man, how did the audition go?
Estelle said I didn't get it.
What?! Why? Joey you were so ready for it!
Yeah, I thought so too but, she said the casting people had some problems with me.
What kind of problem?
Well to tell you the truth, they uh, they had a problem with the bag!
Oh my God!
Nooooo!
Y'know what? It was a stupid play anyway!
Y'know, Joey, I think it's time to give up the bag.
I don't wanna give up the bag. I don't have to give up the bag! Do I Rach? Oh, you think I should give up the bag!
Honey wait, Joey, I'm sorry I mean as terrific as I think you are with it...
Oh, hey!
...I just don't know if the world is ready for you and your bag.
I can't believe I'm hearing this!
Wait a minute! Wait a minute! I'm not saying that you shouldn't have a bag, I just-it's just there are other bags that are a little less umm, controversial.
Yeah umm, they're called wallets.
Oh hey, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy is putting stuff in boxes!
I'd say from the looks of it; our naked buddy is moving.
Ironically, most of the boxes seem to be labeled clothes.
Ohh, I'm gonna miss that big old squishy butt.
And we're done with the chicken fried rice.
Hey! Hey! If he's moving, maybe I should try to get his place!
Good idea! Yes!
It would be so cool to live across from you guys!
Hey, yeah! Then we could do that telephone thing! Y'know, you have a can, we have a can and it's connected by a string!
Or we can do the actual telephone thing.
Oh my God! I love this apartment! Isn't it perfect?! I can't believe I never realized how great it is!
Well that is because your eye immediately goes to the big naked man.
It's amazing! You better hurry up and fill out an application or I'm gonna beat you to it.
Ohh.
Well, I never thought I'd say this, but I'm gonna go use Ugly Naked Guy's bathroom.
Oh, look! There's Monica and Chandler! Hey! Hey, you guys! Hey! Ohh!! Ohh! Ahh-ahhh!!
What?!
Ahhh!! Chandler and Monica!! Chandler and Monica!!
Oh my God!
CHANDLER AND MONICA!!!!
OH MY GOD!!!
OH!! MY EYES!!! MY EYES!!!!
Phoebe!! Phoebe!! It's okay!! It's okay!!
NO! THEY'RE DOING IT!!!
I KNOW!! I KNOW!! I KNOW!
YOU KNOW?!!!
Yes, I know! And Joey knows! But Ross doesn't know so you have to stop screaming!!
What's going on?
Ohhh!!!
HI!! Hi!
What?! What?!
Nothing! Oh God, we're just so excited that you want to get this apartment!
Actually, it looks really good.
Get in here!!!
You mean whenever Monica and Chandler where like y'know doing laundry or going grocery shopping or-Oh! All that time Monica spent on the phone with sad Linda from camp!
Uh-huh, doing it. Doing it. Phone doing it.
Oh! Oh, I can't believe it! I mean I think it's great! For him. She might be able to do better.
Hey guys!
Joey! Come here! Come here!
What? What?
Phoebe just found out about Monica and Chandler.
You mean how they're friends and nothing more?
No. Joey, she knows! We were at Ugly Naked Guy's apartment and we saw them doing it through the window. Actually, we saw them doing it up against the window.
Okay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that Rachel knows?
Yes, but y'know what? It doesn't matter who knows what. Now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know! Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!
Or, we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own.
Wh-what do you mean?
Well y'know every time that they say that like they're doing laundry we'll just give them a bunch of laundry to do.
Ohhh, I-I would enjoy that!
No-no-no! No-no wait Rach, you know what would even be more fun? Telling them.
Ehhh, no, I wanna do Phoebe's thing.
I can't take any...
No! You don't have to do anything! Just don't tell them that we know!
Noo! I can't take any more secrets! I've got your secrets. I've got their secrets. I got secrets of my own y'know!
You don't have any secrets!
Oh yeah? Well, you don't know about Hugsy, my bedtime penguin pal.
So umm, how-how are we gonna mess with them?
Ugh.
Well, you could use your position y'know as the roommate.
Okay.
And then. I would use y'know the strongest tool at my disposal. My sexuality.
Hello children!
Hey!
Okay, watch, learn, and don't eat my cookie.
Hey.
Hey! Ooh, wow that jacket looks great on you!
Really?
Yeah the material feels so soft-hello Mr. Bicep! Have you been working out?
Well, I try to y'know, squeeze things. Are you okay?
Well, if you really wanna know, I'm-Oh! I can't tell you this.
Phoebe, it's me. You can tell me anything.
Well actually you're the one person I can't tell this too. And the one person I want to the most.
What's going on?
I think it's just y'know that I haven't been with a guy in so long and how sometimes you're looking for something and you just don't even see that it's right there in front of you sipping coffee-Oh no, have I said to much? Well it's just something to think about. I know I will.
You are so cute! How did you get to be so cute?
Well, my Grandfather was Swedish and my Grandmother was actually a tiny little bunny.
Okay, now you're even cuter!!
Y'know that is a popular opinion today I must say.
What?
The weirdest thing happened at the coffee house, I think, I think Phoebe was hitting on me.
What are you talking about?
I'm telling you I think Phoebe thinks I'm foxy.
That's not possible!
Ow!
I'm sorry it's just, Phoebe just always thought you were, you were charming in a, in a sexless kind of way.
Oh, y'know I-I can't hear that enough.
I'm sorry, I think that you just misunderstood her.
No, I didn't misunderstand, okay? She was all over me! She touched my bicep for crying out loud!
This bicep?
Well it's not flexed right now!
Hey Mon, what are you doing now? Wanna come see a movie with us?
Uhh, y'know actually I was gonna do some laundry.
Oh.
Hey Chandler, wanna do it with me?
Sure, I'll do it with ya.
Okay.
Okay great, hold on a sec! Oh, here you go! You don't mind do ya? That would really help me out a lot! Thanks!
I mean I-I don't I think I have enough quarters.
I have quarters!
Hey!
Hey Ross! Any word on the apartment yet?
Well, I called over there and it turns out Ugly Naked Guy is subletting it himself and he's already had like a hundred applicants.
Oh.
No-no, I got the edge. I know it's not exactly ethical but I sent him a little bribe to
Oh, is it that pinball machine with the big bow on it?
No.
That new mountain bike?
No.
Well what did you send?
A basket of mini-muffins.
But there's a whole table of mini-muffin baskets. Which one did you send?
The small one.
What?! You-you actually thought that basket was gonna get you the apartment?
Well yeah! Someone sent us a basket at work once and people went crazy over those little muffins. It was the best day.
Your work makes me sad.
Oh man! I want that place so much!! I was so sure that was gonna work! There's twelve bucks I'll never see again!
All right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie.
Bye!
Bye!
Bye Chandler! I miss you already.
Okay, did you see that?! With the inappropriate and the pinching!!
Actually, I did!
Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me?
Ohhh, oh my God! Oh my God! She knows about us!
Are you serious?
Phoebe knows and she's just trying to freak us out! That's the only explanation for it!
Okay but what about y'know my pinchable butt and my bulging biceps-She knows!
Joey!
Yeah?
Phoebe knows about us!
Well I didn't tell them!
Them?! Who's them?
Uhhh, Phoebe and Joey.
Joey!
And Rachel. I would've told you but they made me promise not to tell!
Oh man!
I'm sorry! But hey, it's over now, right? Because you can tell them that you know they know and I can go back to knowing absolutely nothing!
Unless...
No! Not unless! Look this must end now!
Oh man, they think they are so slick messing with us! But see they don't know that we know that they know! So...
Ahh yes, the messers become the messies!
Noooo.
Oh Ross, honey you gotta stop torturing yourself!
Yeah, why don't you just find another apartment?
Look I've already looked at like a thousand apartments this month and none of them even compares to that one!
Y'know what you should do?
Huh?
You should find out what his hobbies are and then use that to bond with him. Yeah! Like if I would strike up a conversation about say umm, sandwiches. Or uh, or my underwear.
I'm listening.
See?
That is a great idea! And! I know Ugly Naked Guy because we've been watching him for like five years so that gives me back my edge! Oh, let's see now he had the trampoline.
He broke that.
Well, he had gravity boots.
Yeah, he broke those too.
So he likes to break stuff.
Okay, I've got to go pick up Ben but I-I will figure something out. Hey, didn't he used to have a cat?
I wouldn't bring that up, it would probably just bum him out.
Yeah, poor cat, never saw that big butt coming.
Right.
Hello! Oh yeah! Hey! Hold on a second she's right here! It's Chandler.
Oh? Hello you.
Hello Phoebe, I've been thinking about you all day.
Eh?
Well you know that thing you said before, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't intrigued.
Really?
Yeah, listen, Joey isn't gonna be here tonight so why don't you come over and I'll let you uh, feel my bicep. Or maybe more.
I'll have to get back to you on that. Okay, bye! Oh my God! He wants me to come over and feel his bicep and more!
Are you kidding?!
No!
I can not believe he would do that to Mon-Whoa! Joey, do they know that we know?
No.
Joey!
They know you know.
Ugh, I knew it! Oh I cannot believe those two!
God, they thought they can mess with us! They're trying to mess with us?! They don't know that we know they know we know! Joey, you can't say anything!
I couldn't even if I wanted too.
Good evening, sir. My name is Ross Geller. I'm one of the people who applied for the apartment. And I-I realize that the competition is fierce but-I'm sorry. I, I can't help but notice you're naked and I applaud you. Man, I wish I was naked. I mean, this-this looks so great. That is how God intended it.
All right. All right! If he wants a date? He's gonna get a date. All right, I'm gonna go in.
All right. Be sexy.
Please.
So Chandler, I-I'd love to come by tonight.
Really?
Oh absolutely. Shall we say, around seven?
Yes.
Good. I'm really looking forward to you and me having sexual intercourse.
Hey-hey, check it out! Check it out! Ugly Naked Guy has a naked friend!
Oh yeah! Oh my God! That is our friend! It's Naked Ross!
Yeah, it is! Naked Ross!!
Show time!
Okay, Rachel, get me perfume!
Okay!
And Joey, get me a bottle of wine and glasses?
All right, it'll be great! You just make her think you wanna have sex with her! It'll totally freak her out!
Okay, listen, how far am I gonna have to go with her?
Relax, she-she's gonna give in way before you do!
How do you know?!
Because you're on my team! And my team always wins!
At this?!
Just go get some! Go!
Okay honey, now I'm gonna try to listen from right here!
Okay.
Okay? Whoa, wait!
Good idea!
Yeah, oh wait!
Oh now, don't give away the farm!
Phoebe.
Chandler.
Come on in.
I was going too. Umm, I brought some wine. Would you like some?
Sure.
So, here we are. Nervous?
Me? No. You?
No, I want this to happen.
So do I.
I'm gonna put on some music.
Maybe, maybe I'll dance for you.
You look good.
Thanks! Y'know, that when you say things like that it makes me wanna rip that sweater vest right off!
Well, why don't we move this into the bedroom?
Really?
Oh, do you not want to?
No. No! It's just y'know first, I wanna take off all my clothes and have you rub lotion on me.
Well that would be nice. I'll go get the lotion.
Listen, this is totally getting out of hand! Okay? She wants me to put lotion on her!
She's bluffing!
Look, she's not backing down! She went like this!
He's not backing down. He went to get lotion.
Oh man! Aren't you guys done yet?! I wanna sit in my chair!
Joey look, just look at it this way, the sooner Phoebe breaks Chandler the sooner this is all over and out in the open.
Ooh!
Okay!
I like that! Oh, okay! Show him your bra! He's afraid of bras! Can't work 'em!
Joey! Wow, you didn't rip off any buttons.
It's not my first time.
You go back out there and you seduce her till she cracks!
Okay, give me a second! Did you clean up in here?
Of course.
Oh, you're-you're going?
Umm, not without you, lover. So, this is my bra.
It's very, very nice. Well, come here. I'm very were gonna be having all the sex.
You should be. I'm very bendy. I'm gonna kiss you now.
Not if I kiss you first.
Ooh.
Well, I guess there's nothing left for us to do but-but kiss.
Here it comes. Our first kiss.
Okay! Okay! Okay! You win! You win!! I can't have sex with ya!
And why not?!
Because I'm in love with Monica!!
You're-you're what?!
Love her! That's right, I...LOVE...HER!!! I love her!! I love you, Monica.
I love you too Chandler.
I just-I thought you guys were doing it, I didn't know you were in love!
Dude!
And hats off to Phoebe. Quite a competitor. And might I say your breasts are still showing.
God!
All right! So that's it! It's over! Everybody knows!
Well actually, Ross doesn't.
Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet.
A new place for a new Ross. I'm gonna have you and all the guys from work over once it's y'know, furnished.
I must say it's nice to see you back on your feet.
Well I am that. And that whole rage thing is definitely behind me.
I wonder if its time for you to rejoin our team at the museum?
Oh Donald that-that would be great. I am totally ready to come back to work. I-What? No! Wh... What are you doing?!! GET OFF MY SISTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Chandler!!! Chandler!!! Chandler, I saw what you were doing through the window! Chandler, I saw what you were doing to my sister! Now get out here!
Wow! Listen, we had a good run. What was it? Four? Five months? I mean, that's more than most people have in a lifetime! So, good-bye, take care, bye-bye then!
What are you doing?!
Oh, I'm going on the lamb.
Come on Chandler, come on, I can handle Ross. Hold on! Hey Ross. What's up bro?
What the hell are doing?!!
Hey, what's-what's going on?!
Well, I think, I think Ross knows about me and Monica.
Dude! He's right there!
I thought you were my best friend, this is my sister! My best friend and my sister! I-I cannot believe this!
Look, we're not just messing around! I love her. Okay, I'm in love with her.
I'm so sorry that you had to find out this way. I'm sorry, but it's true, I love him too.
My best friend and my sister! I cannot believe this. You guys probably wanna get some hugs in too, huh? Big news!
Awww, no, it's okay, we've actually known for a while.
What? What? What?! You guys knew? You all knew and you didn't tell me?!!
Well, Ross, we were worried about you. We didn't know how you were going to react.
You were worried about me? You didn't know how I was going to react?
Okay, all right, whew! What do you say we all clear out of here and let these two lovebirds get back down to business? Hey-hey-hey, I-I-I'm just talking here, he-he's the one doing your sister.
Hey, you know what I just realized? If you guys ever have kids...
Whoa-whoa-whoa! We're having kids?!
I call Godfather!
You can't just call Godfather. Don't you think her brother should be Godfather?
Sure, if you cared enough to call it first.
Guys, you're a few steps ahead of us.
Yeah, big zero gravity moon steps.
Oh! Oh, I just thought of the greatest wedding gift to get you.
Ooh, I'll go in on that with you! I couldn't think of anything.
Okay.
Oh, hey Katie! Everyone, this is Katie.
Hi!
Hi!
So, are you ready to go?
Yeah, I just gotta run to the bathroom.
Oh sure, right back there.
Hey, where are we going to lunch?
I was thinking Chinese food.
Ohh, I love Chinese! How did you know I love Chinese?!
She is so cute! You could fit her right in your little pocket!
I don't know. I mean I like her a lot, and she's really nice, but...
But what?
She keeps punching me.
In that cute, little, sweet way she just did?
Hey, it's a lot harder than it looks! Okay? She-she-she's hurting me.
I know what you need, you need a bodyguard. Hey Ross, what is Ben doing after preschool?
Hey listen, come on, Joey is having a problem! A little girl is beating him up.
Aww, Joey, come here. Look honey, I know this must be really, really difficult for you and I--Oh, I'm sorry. Am I hurting you?
Hey!
Hey! I brought you some house warming gifts.
Aww.
Yeah. Salt, so your life always has flavor.
Huh.
Bread, so you never go hungry.
Ohh.
And a scented candle for the bathroom, because well, y'know.
Thanks. Thanks. And thanks again.
Yeah!
Hi!
Hi!
Welcome to the building. I'm uh, Steve Sarah; I'm president of the tenants committee.
Oh hi! Ross Geller. And this is my friend Phoebe.
Oh hi Phoebe.
Mr. President.
I came to talk to you about Howard.
Howard?
Yeah, he's the handy man. He's gonna be retiring next week and everyone who lives here is kicking in a 100 bucks as a thank you for all the hard work type of thing.
Oh that's nice.
Yeah. So, do you want to give a check? Or...
Oh. Uhh...
Oh look, you don't have to give it too me right now! You can slip it under my door.
No-no, it's not that, it's just... I-I just moved in.
Well, the guy's worked here for 25 years.
Yes, but I've lived here for 25 minutes.
Oh, okay, I get it.
No wait, look. Look! I'm sorry, it's just I've never even met Howard. I-I mean I don't know Howard.
Howard's the handy man!
Yes but too me he's just, man.
Okay, fine, whatever. Welcome to the building.
Ugh, can you believe that guy!
Yeah. I really like his glasses.
...so then President Steve told everyone that I was a cheapskate, and now the whole building hates me! A little kid spit on my knee! Y'know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna throw a party. That's right. For everyone in the building, and I'm gonna sit them down and explain to them, I am not a bad guy. I am not a cheap guy! I'm just a guy who-who stands up for what he believes in. A man with principles.
Sounds like a fun party.
Hmm. Look, Ross, if you want your neighbors to like you, why don't you just pay the hundred bucks? The party's gonna cost you way more than that.
It doesn't matter! It's my principles! We're talking about my principles!
Okay, I thought it was about your neighbors liking you.
Oh, they'll like me. Once they come to my awesome PAR-TAY! Okay, I gotta run. I gotta go get some nametags.
And that crazy party animal will be your brother-in-law.
Very, very funny, but don't say things like that in front of Monica. I don't want you putting any ideas in her head.
Umm, Chandler, you do realize that those ideas are probably already in Monica's head.
Wh-wh-why?!
Well, because she loves you and because you love her.
Yeah, so, what's that supposed to mean?!
Hey, Chandler, don't freak out! I'm telling you something you already know! Come on, she broke up with Richard because he didn't want to have babies. And she's a woman, and she's almost 30, and y'know it's Monica.
I don't see it that way. Okay? Because, I see two Monicas, the one that was my friend, who lived across the hall, and wanted to have a lot of babies and then the new Monica, who I just started to date. Now, who's to say what she wants?! I'm right. I'm right. Am I right?
No, you're right, you are absolutely right. I mean that makes, that makes everything different.
Okay. It's not different at all, is it?
Not unless different means the same.
You were so funny with that waiter! You're such a nut!
Y'know, breadstick fangs are always funny.
No, you make them funny. You're the funny one!
Uhh, look Katie, uh listen, we-we need to talk. Okay? Umm, look I like you. I-I really do, I like you a lot. Okay? But sometimes when you, when you playfully punch me like that it-it feels like someone's hitting me with a very tiny but very real bat.
Aww, like I could hurt you. Are you making fun of my size? Don't make fun of me because of my size!
Isn't this great?
Hmm.
Couldn't you just stay like this forever? Chandler! Couldn't you just stay here forever?
Yeah, here, somewhere else, y'know where-where ever.
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm cool. Casual.
What-what are you doing?
I'm just hanging out. Y'know, having fun. Y'know with the girl that I'm seeing casually.
Man, I knew it! I knew you were going to do this!!
What?!
Get all freaked out because everybody was talking and just joking around about marriage and stuff.
Well, you do want all that stuff, right?
Oh and you know what I want!
Yes! You want babies! You have baby fever!
I do not have baby fever!
Oh please, you are obsessed with babies and-and marriage and everything that's related to babies and-and marriage! I've got an idea, why don't we turn down the heat on this pressure cooker?!
Have you lost your mind? Chandler, this isn't about me! This is about you and all your weird relationship commitment crap!
Nah-uh! I know you! Okay? I know the thoughts that you have in the head--in your head!
You don't know everything. Did you know that I'm going out with Rachel tonight instead of you? Hmm? And did you know that the only baby around here is you?! And did you know that I can't even look at you right now?!
Well, I did not know that.
It's gonna be okay, right? I mean she's not gonna leave me? This is, this is fixable.
Oh yeah, yeah, sure. Absolutely.
By me?
Oh, no!
No-no.
Well, unless you make some kind of big gesture.
Yeah, big!
Uh-oh, shht! The Misses.
Gunther, can I get a coffee to go?
Monica.
I'm still not done not wanting to talk to you.
Just tell me what I need to do to make things right.
What?!
Well, that's what we do. Y'know, I-I mess up and then you tell me how to fix it and then I do and then y'know you think I'm all cute again.
Really? I'm really tired of being your relationship tutor. You're gonna have to figure this one for yourself. All right? Y'know what? If you're too afraid to be in a real relationship, then don't be in one.
Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Yay!!
Phoebe!
Oh, hi Ross!
What are you doing?
Oh, I thought this was your party and it turns out it's a party for Howard. He's just the sweetest little man!
See ya Phoebe! Oh and hey, thanks for chipping in!
You chipped in?!
Yeah, uh-huh, a 100 dollars.
Phoebe! I can't believe you gave them money! I thought you agreed it was totally unreasonable that they asked me for that money!
Yeah, but they didn't ask me! Y'know? This way I'm just y'know, the exotic, generous stranger. That's always fun to be.
Yeah, but you're making me look bad!
No I'm not. No! If anything I'm making you look better! They'll see you talking to me and that's--I'm a hit!
Oh hey, Pheebs!
Hey!
Oh hey, Ross. Umm, see, I was thinking maybe you two could switch apartments because Phoebe's more our kind of people. Something to think about.
Yeah, okay, my bad.
Hey!
Hi! Wow! You look, you look...big.
Thanks! I've been working out. Hey listen, is it obvious that I'm wearing six sweaters?
Uhhh, yeah. But it's not obvious why.
Well look, I'm breaking up with Katie so I had to put on some extra padding. Y'know? I mean, if she hits me when she's happy, can you imagine how hard she's gonna hit me when I tell her I'm taking away the Joey love?
Hi!
Hey! Hiya!
Hey! Hey, cute jacket!
Oh, thanks! That's so sweet!
Oh! Ow!
Oh, ow! Did Joey tell you to say that? You guys, are too much!
Whoa! Y'know what Katie? I gotta tell ya I-I-I-I think you are the one who is too much.
Ohh, Joey has the nicest friends!
Ohh, and the nicest girlfriend!
You're so sweet!
Ohh, you're so sweet!
Oww!!!! Joey, she just kicked me.
Huh.
Well? Aren't you gonna do something?
Uhh....
You'd better do something, or I'm gonna walk out that door right now! Well? Are you gonna?
Nah.
Phoebe?
That's what I'm saying.
Phoebe? Phoebe?
Ooh.
Look, this is a disaster! Can't I please just go?
No! No! I'm talking you up to people. Just give it a little time, all right? Relax, get something to eat! Okay?
So uh, what did you tell them about me?
Oh, I was telling them about you and Emily. Y'know, try to get some sympathy.
Ohh.
But somehow you came off as the bad guy.
What?!
Yeah, I think I told it wrong. Y'know, we should talk about that because I don't totally understand what happened there.
Ohh, this cake is really good!
Oh, okay, see? Things are looking up already!
Oh my God! Someone cut Howard's cake! Who would do a think like that?
3-B!
Oh yeah, aww!
Okay, you got your free food! You ruined everyone's fun! Don't you think it's time you went home?!
Yeah, leave!
Yeah, get out! Now!
Go back to 3-B, 3-B!
All right, everyone calm down! Everyone calm down! I have something that I would like to say! Who here likes Ross? Of course you don't like him! He-he didn't give you any money, he raised his own hand when I asked, "Who hear likes Ross," and he's wearing two nametags! I-I'll be honest with you guys, when I first met Ross I didn't like him at all! But then once I got to know him I saw that he's really sweet and caring and very generous. I mean, all I'm saying is don't judge Ross before you get to know him all right? I mean, I like all you guys now, but when I first meet you y'know Kurt, I thought, y'know abrasive drunk, umm Lola, mind numbingly stupid! And okay, you guys Gold-digger, cradle robbing perv! So, I think you all know what I mean.
Obviously I didn't think they were gonna start throwing things. I just thought if I kept insulting everyone, you would jump in and defend everyone and then you could look like the hero.
Oh wow, yeah! See, I did not get that.
Where's Monica?! Where is she? I need to talk to her! It's urgent! Is she here?
I'm Monica.
I need to talk to you, it's urgent!
Okay.
Okay, I've been doing a lot of thinking about us, y'know a lot of uhh, us thinking. And uh, well I guess there's only one-one way to do this.
Wait what-wh-wh-what are you doing?!
Monica...
No-no, don't-don't-don't do it!
Will you marry me?
Oh-no. No. No.
What a bad idea!
Ohhhh, I cannot look at it!
Chandler, why are you doing this?
I don't know. But I know I'm not afraid to do this.
Chandler.
I'm doing this because I'm sorry?
Do you umm, you really think the best reason to get married is because you're sorry?
No, the best reason to get married is pregnancy. Sorry is pretty much fourth y'know, behind being ready and actually wanting to get married. Will you be my wife?
Chandler, umm, I want you to take just a minute and I want you to think about how ridiculous this sounds.
Yeah, I'm kinda wishing everyone wasn't here right now.
Honey! Do you know that none of that stuff came from me?! I mean I never said I wanted to have babies and get married right now!
Yeah I know, but I was really confused and then I talked to these guys.
Who? Two divorces and Joey?!
Hey!
She's right y'know.
Yeah, but still, cheap shot!
Y'know what? Y'know when I said that I want you to deal with this relationship stuff all on your own? Well, you're not ready for that.
I didn't think I was!
Oh my God, what would have done if I said yes?
Well I would've been happy because I would've be able to spend the rest of my life with the woman that I love. Or, you would've seen a Chandler shaped hole in that door.
Hey Ross, will you pass me that knife?
No, I will not!
Oh, it's okay. You don't have to be so mean about it.
You're right, I'm sorry. Will you marry me?
Aw, and I was gonna ask you to marry me because I forgot to say hello to you last week.
Oh no wait Pheebs, I think for something like that you just ask them to move in with you. But I'm not sure, Chandler?
Okay, how long is this going to go on.
Well I think the length of teasing is directly related to how insane you were so, a long time.
This is fun. Hey Rach, remember that whole "We were on a break thing?" Well, I'm sorry, will you marry me?
That's not funny.
That's not funny at all!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
What are you guys doing up?
Oh, we wanted to finish the crossword before we went to bed. Hey, do you know a six-letter word for red?
Dark red.
Yeah, I think that's wrong, but there's a Connect the Dots in here for you later. Hey, how about maroon?
Yes, you are so smart!
Aww, you guys are so cute!
I know.
All right, I'll see you in the morning.
Okay.
Y'know, I love doing crossword puzzles with you honey!
Aww, me too. Now let's finish this and go to bed.
Okay! There's only one left, three letter word, not dog but...
Cat.
Yes! You are so smart! I love you.
I love you too.
Uhh, we still need a tip.
All right. Hold on. I got it. Nickel! How much more do we need?
A couple of bucks.
Okay, dime! You guys should probably keep talking; this could take a while. Oh no, wait! Look it! Whoa! Oh my God, this is a police badge!
Wow!
Oh that's so cool! Why would a cop come in here though? They don't serve donuts. Y'know what actually, could you discover the badge again? I think I can come up with something better than that.
Phoebe, I bet somebody's missing that badge.
Yeah, I should probably take it back. Ooh, but you know what? While I'm at the police station, I could check their Ten Most Wanted lists because my friend Fritzy has been like number 11 forever, so this could be her year!
Hey, you guys!
Hey!
Hey Joey!
Hey.
Hey. That uh, that my sweatshirt?
Oh yes, it is. I'm sorry I borrowed it, I was cold. I hope its okay?
Well uh, it's just that uh, y'know if-if you're gonna be wearing someone's sweatshirt shouldn't it be your boyfriends--and I'm not him.
I'm sorry, I'll give it back to you.
No-no! No! I mean it's gonna be all smelling like Monica!
Are you saying I smell bad?
No! No, you smell like a meadow. I'm sorry.
What's with him?
Oh, y'know what? The last time Joey went to a meadow, his mother was shot by a hunter.
Ugh!
Yeah, I still don't know. I'm sorry I just wanna make sure that I bought the right couch. I need a couch that says, "Kids welcome here." But that also says, "Come here to me!"
What?! You say that to kids?!!
No! No! No! The "Come here to me" is y'know for the ladies.
Ross, honey, it's a nice couch. It's not a magic couch.
You picked a great couch.
Yeah?
Yeah. Could you just sign right here please?
Oh, sure. Whoa-whoa, what's this? The delivery charge is almost as much as the couch!
Wait! No, that's ridiculous. Come on, he lives three blocks away!
Yeah, y'know what? I'll take it myself, thank you! All right Rach, let's go!
Yeah! Are you kiddin'?
Oh, come on it's only three blocks! And-and, it's not very heavy, try it! Come on! Come on!
Oh. Oh! I can do it!
Yeah!
You two are really gonna enjoy that couch.
Oh yeah, we're uh, yeah we're not together.
Ohh, okay. Something didn't quite add up there.
Ross!
What's that supposed to mean?
Ross!
Well you, her, I mean, she's very...y'know. And you're like...y'know.
Not that it's any of your business, but we did go out.
Really? You two?
Yeah! Rach?
Come on, I don't really want to be doing this right now. I am carrying a very heavy couch.
Then tell him quickly.
Fine! We went out.
Not only did we go out, we did it 298 times!
Ross!! Oh my--ugh!! You kept count?! You are such a loser!
A loser you did it with 298 times!
Oh. Oh! Ma'am? Excuse me, ma'am?
Yes?
You can't put your cigarette out on a tree!
Yeah I can, it worked real well.
No but you shouldn't! Don't ever do that again.
I won't! Until I have my next cigarette.
Hold it! N.Y.P.D! Freeze punk!
What?!
Yeah that's right you are so busted. Book 'em.
Who are you talking too?
Save it Red! Unless you wanna spend the night in the slammer, you apologize to the tree.
I am not going to apologize to a tree!
You apologize to the tree right now or I am calling for backup. Backup! Backup!!
I-I'm sorry! Sorry.
Okay, cancel backup! Cancel backup!
Okay.
Ross, didn't you say that there was an elevator in here?
Uhh, yes I did but there isn't. Okay, here we go.
Okay, go left. Left! Left!
Okay, y'know what? There is no more left, left!
Oh okay, lift it straight up over your head! Straight up over your head! You can do it! You can do it! Okay. You got it?
Yeah.
Good-good-good.
Oh-oh!
Yeah, you got it right? You got it right? You got it?
Any chance you think the couch looks good there?
...so this guy was all And I'm all, Buffay, Homicide. It was just so cool!
Phoebe, you were supposed to take that back!
I know but I'm having so much fun doing good deeds.
Okay, but impersonating a police officer is a serious thing. You could get arrested.
You could get arrested, right now! All right, yeah, I gotta take it back. I'm totally drunk with power.
Hey.
Hey! Oh.
Hi, Joe.
Yeah, I didn't know you guys were going to be here.
Hey Joey, sweetie, taste this.
What?! Why?!
What is going on with you?
Nothing!
Oh, come on! You've been acting strange all day!
All right! There is something. I kinda had a dream, but I don't want to talk about it.
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-what-what if Martin Luther King had said that? I kinda have a dream! I don't want to talk about it.
Well, it involved Monica.
You had a dream about a girl that I am seeing?! Oh, that is so cool! I can't tell you how many times I've dreamt about a girl that he was seeing. Anyway we're talking about your dream. I love you. Your dream?
Don't worry, there wasn't any sex in it or anything. I haven't dreamt about her like that since I found out about you two--ish.
What was the dream about?
Well, okay. You were my girlfriend and we were doing the crossword puzzle. Y'know like you guys were doing last night. So, that's it. I'm in love with Monica and I'll be moving out.
Wait, Joey! Joey! That doesn't mean that-that you're in love with me!
It-it doesn't?
No!
No, it can mean anything. Like uh, all of the sudden you're jealous because I've become the apartment stud.
That kinda sounds like your dream dude.
Or, it could mean that-that you saw Chandler and me together and we y'know were being close and stuff and then you just want to have that with someone too.
In the dream I did enjoy the closeness.
Um-hmm.
Joey, look, are you attracted to Monica? Right here, right now, are you attracted to her?
Not really.
Well there you have it!
Well sure! I'm just wearing sweats! But that's good that you're not in love with me, because you just want a girlfriend!
No, I don't think it's just about just getting a girlfriend. Y'know? I mean, yeah, I can get a girlfriend! Yeah, we could sit in the chair and do crosswords, but y'know are we ever going to have y'know the closeness like-like you guys have?
Well y'know, Monica and I were friends before we started dating. So maybe-maybe that's it?
Friends first? That's interesting.
You become friends after?
No, never done that either.
Hey, umm, do you guys have that tape measure?
Oh yeah, it's actually in my bedroom.
That's right.
What's up Joey?
How you doin'?
Excuse me, is this your car?
Yeah.
Well I don't think it's very nice of you to park here, y'know you're blocking the entrance.
Don't worry about it. It's not a problem.
Well, it's a problem for me, which means it's a problem for you 'cause I'm a cop.
So am I!
Ohh, no. Oh okay, so you're a cop which means you can park anywhere, 'cause I know that 'cause I'm a cop too. So, all right, keep up the good work. 10-4.
Hey, wait a second! So wait, what precinct are you with?
I-I'm with the umm, the 57th.
Oh, I know a guy in homicide up there.
I'm in vice. Yeah, in fact I'm undercover right now. I'm a whore.
Who-who else is in vice up there?
Umm, do you know, umm Sipowicz?
Sipowicz? No, I don't think so.
Yeah, big guy, kinda bald.
No, I don't know him.
Don't try to call him or anything, 'cause he's not there, he's out. His umm, his partner just died.
Wow umm, tell Sipowicz I'm real sorry for his loss.
I-I sure will, take care.
Hey by the way, I'm sure Sipowicz is gonna be all right. I heard that kid from Silver Spoons is really good. And where did you find my badge?
Oh.
Hey! Joey, would you mind giving me and Ross a hand moving his couch?
Oh, I'd love too, but I got acting class. But y'know what? I guess I can blow that off, for you.
Thanks!
Uh, hey, Rach let me ask you something. Uh, I was just over there talking to Monica and Chandler, boy they are really tight.
I know.
Yeah that's not such a bad situation they got going over there. I'm thinking of getting me one of those.
What's up Joe?
Well, the reason I think Monica and Chandler are so great...
Yeah?
...is because they were friends first. Y'know? So I asked myself, "Who are my friends?" You and Phoebe, and I saw you first. So...
What are you saying?
I'm saying maybe you and I crank it up a notch.
Y'know honey, umm, as uh, as flattered as I am that uh, you saw me first, uhh, I just, I-I don't think we should be cranking anything up.
I'll treat you real nice.
Yeah, well, y'know umm... No honey, listen I think it's a great idea to become friends with someone before you date them, but I think the way you do it is y'know you meet someone, become their friend, build a foundation, then you ask them out on a date. Don't hit on your existing friends!
Won't-won't that take longer?
Yeah. Yeah. Oh, but once you find it, ohh it's so worth the wait.
Yeah. I understand. I understand. Man, I wish I saw Phoebe first!
Come here to me. No-no, you come here to me.
Hey Ross! I brought reinforcements.
Oh great! What, you brought Joey?
Well, I brought the next best thing.
Hey!
Chandler?! You brought Chandler?! The next best thing would be Monica!
Y'know, I would be offended, but Monica is freakishly strong, so...
Look, I-I drew a sketch about how we're gonna do it. Okay Rach, that's you. That's the couch.
Whoa-oh, what's-what's that?
Oh, that's me.
Wow! You certainly think a lot of yourself.
No! That's-that's my arm!
Oh, I see. I thought you just really, really liked your new couch.
Y'know what? Just-just follow my lead.
Okay!
Okay.
Come on, Chandler.
All right. Okay, here we go!
All right, ready?
Yeah.
Turn.
Okay.
Turn! Turn!
Okay, I don't think we can turn anymore!
Ross, I don't, I just don't think it's going to fit.
Oh yeah it will! Come on, up! Up-up-up! Up! Yes! Here we go! Pivot! Pivot! Piv-ot! Piv-et!! Piv-ett!!! Piv-et!
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!!
Okay, I don't think it's going to pivot anymore.
You think?!
All right, let's uh, let's bring it back down and-and try again.
Okay, yeah, I think it's really stuck now.
I can't believe that didn't work!
I know, me neither! I mean, you had a sketch!
Oh, y'know, what did you mean when you said pivot?
Hey!
Hey! How's it going? Did you make any new friends?
Yeah, yeah, I met this woman.
Hey, whoa-whoa! What's she like?
Uhh, well, she's...really good in bed.
Joey, I thought you were gonna try to be friends first!
Well look, hey, it's all your fault!
What?! Why?!
Well because you didn't give me advice! No! You gave me a pickup line! As soon as I told her I wanted to y'know, build a foundation and be friends first. I suddenly, through no fault of my own, became irresistible to her! And her roommate!
What about the closeness?
Closeness-shmoshness! There was three of us for crying out loud!
All right! Hey, who wants pizza?!
Ooh, I do! I do! I do!
Oh, great! Can you believe I found it on the second floor?
Who is it?
N.Y.P.D!!
Oh my God!
Uhh, just a minute officer!!
I'm looking for Phoebe Buffay!
Ooh, God, it's him! It's that cop! God, I can't believe it! He found me!
Oh my God, Phoebe, are you gonna go to jail?!
Well, if I'm going down, I'm taking you with me. Harboring a fugitive? That's one to three years minimum. Good luck Chandler. Okay, you can arrest me. Fine. But you'll never make it stick and you know it!
Yeah, but I kinda don't have a choice, it's my job. I mean, you understand right?
Yep! As long as you understand that I'm going to call my lawyer and once he puts you on the stand he'll make you look like a fool. A fool!
I don't like looking foolish. Y'know what? Maybe uh, I don't arrest you today. Maybe I came by and you weren't here.
I would love it if I weren't here!
Okay, so since umm, you're not going to jail tonight I was wondering if you would like to go to dinner with me?
Me?!
Yeah. Ever since you flashed my badge at me, I kinda can't stop thinking about you. You're the prettiest, fake undercover whore I've ever seen.
Nice!
Wow! I didn't see that coming! You're-you're asking me out!
Yeah. I mean, I coulda done it better, but these people keep staring at me.
Umm, yeah, I'd like to go out with you officer...
Gary.
Gary.
Okay, so it's a date.
Yeah! So--ooh, I gotta ask you though. How did you know where to find me?
Well you're fingerprints were all over my badge so I just ran it through the computer and this was listed as your last known address so I just checked it out.
Ohh, impressive.
Not as impressive as you. I gotta tell you, I looked at your record and you've done some pretty weird stuff.
Yeah, we'll talk at dinner.
Okay. So I'll come by in a couple hours and pick you up?
All right, I can't wait!
Okay. And don't worry, I'm not just gonna take you out for donuts.
He has a gun!
I'd like to return this couch. I'm not satisfied with it.
You wanna return this couch? It's cut in half!
That's what I'm telling you.
Did you cut this couch in half?
This couch, is cut in half! I would like to exchange it for one that is not cut in half!
You're telling me this couch was delivered to you like this?!
Look, I am a reasonable man. I will accept store credit.
I'll give you store credit in the amount of four dollars.
I take it.
Good, you guys are all here!
Hey! What's up?
Well, I have a job interview at Ralph Lauren tomorrow!
Congratulations! Ohh, that's great!
I know!
Boy, that guy's underwear sucks!
Wh-what?!
I got this pair marked excess, I gotta tell ya, there was no room for excess anything in there.
Anyway, I'm going to be the coordinator of the woman's collection, I'll work right under the director, it's the perfect, perfect job for me!
Wow! Well, if you nail the interview, you'll get it!
Yeah.
You wanna work on your interview skills?
O-okay!
Okay! All right, let's start with the handshake. Hi.
Hi.
Very good handshake, good wrist action.
Let me try.
Okay. Oh my God! What did I ever do to you?!
Did I squeeze it too hard?
Let's just say, I'm glad I'm not Chandler.
That's right Ross, I can see you in your new apartment! And you can see me! Same as yesterday, same as the day before.
Is he doing his shark attack bit yet?
Nope. Op, wait! There he goes.
Very funny Ross! Very life-like and funny. Okay. Oh no-no-no, I wasn't waving at you lady. Whoa, maybe I was! Hey, Monica, this totally hot girl in Ross's building is flirting with me.
Get in there man! Flirt back, mix it up!
Yeah, I-I-I'm down with that. Okay, here goes. How you a-doin'? It worked! She's waving me over. Okay, I-I-I'll be right over. Let's see, she's on the third floor...
Wow! She is pretty, huh?
Tell me about it, huh? Oh no-no-no, I'm not with her, she's just Monica! Ewwuck!
Hey Joey! Great stuff huh?
This is your place?
Of course it is. Yeah, come on in. Ooh-ooh, go by the window you can pretend to be surfing.
But I counted, you're not supposed to live here! Oh man!
Ugh!!
What happened?
I ended up at Ross's place. Oh, I musta missed counted or something. Damn! She's not there anymore. Oh, l-l-look, Ross is doing his 'Watching TV' bit.
No Joey, I think he's just watchin' TV.
We've lost visual contact with the suspect.
Okay, now I've really have to go!
But it's just so unfair that our date has to get cut short just 'cause some guy shot at a store clerk.
I know, but it's my job, sweethart!
Okay, then maybe I can come too!
Suspect has just emerged naked from the sewer.
All right, you go.
Bye-bye.
'Kay, bye!
Oh God!
What?
Oh I just miss him so much!
Wow! For just a week you guys are really close, huh?
Yeah, it's weird. I can't help it though he's so sweet, he's like this little puppy dog, y'know? But like a really tough one that shots bad guys. Ohh, I just love beginning parts of relationships, y'know?! You just like can't keep your hands off each other.
I know it is the best.
So-so how long did that last for you and Chandler?
What? It's still going on.
Come on, seriously! When did it end?
I-I am serious, I mean, we're, we're all over each other all the time.
Okay, you know where you are better than I do. I was just curious.
What don't you just calm down Phoebe! All right?! Why don't you just get all your facts before you run around telling everybody that you're the only hot couple!!
God, I woke the beast. Sorry. I was wrong obviously, I just-I misspoke. It's okay.
Oh no, it is okay, I mean as long as you know that Chandler and I are also very hot and fiery, just as hot as you! I mean our flame, whew, is on fire!
Hey Monica, here's your broom back.
You are so cute.
Oh hey, how'd the interview go?
Ugh, horrible! I did the stupidest, most embarrassing thing!
Did you tell the guy you wanted to have sex with his wife and then fall right out of your chair?
No!
So what happened?
Ugh, it was horrible! And-and the interview part went so well, y'know? I even made him laugh. He said something about a boat and I was like, "Well, yeah! If you've got enough life jackets!" Trust me, it was actually, it was very funny. Anyway, so we were saying good-bye and ugh!
What happened?
All right, we were shaking hands and he kinda leaned toward me... Y'know maybe he was going to open the door, but I totally miss read him and I uhhh...
You kissed him?!
Well, I didn't know what else to do!
Well you coulda tried, not kissing him.
Thanks Chandler.
Hey Rach, a guy from Ralph Lauren called, you got a second interview!
I can't believe it! I got a second interview!
Yes!
I bet that kiss isn't looking like such a big mistake now, is it?
What-what, wait a minute, you don't think that's why he wants me back?
Yeah! No?
A kiss? What are you talking about?
I accidentally kissed him in the interview, and now he wants me back y'know of course, 'cause "Let's bring the girl back who kisses everybody!"
Come on, Rach.
Oh my God! What if he thinks I'm the kind of girl that-that would just sleep with him?
He probably wants you back because you're right for the job.
Maybe. I-I don't know-Oh God, how could I be so stupid?!
Oh Rachel look, don't say that, I think you just need a hug from Joey. Come on. Come on. She's back! Hot girl's back!
Ohh, well I'm not totally back yet, but thank you.
No, in Ross's building! She's back! She's back! Okay, wait there, I'll be over in a second. Got it!
I gotta check out this hot girl! There she is!
Damnit!! Did you move?!
Yes. I lived with you guys for a while and then I found this place. I'm Ross.
Yes?
Uhh do you happen to have a hot girl in there?
No. I'm all alone.
Yeah. Sorry about that. Oh, hey little girl. Uhh, is-is your mommy, or sister, or babysitter by any chance a hot girl?
Daddy!!
Later! Oh man! Hot girl! Hot girl!!
Hi Rachel!
Hi!
Come on in.
It's really nice to see you again.
Thank you.
Oh Rachel, uhh...
What?
Just ah...
Excuse me?
Here let me...
Wh-whoa! All right, okay-okay, I see, I see what's going on here! Now listen, look-look, I'm sorry if I gave you the wrong impression, but I am not some hussy who will just sleep around to get ahead! Now even though I , hey-hey-hey, even though I kissed you, that does not give you the right to demand sex from me. I do not want, this job that bad. Good day, sir.
Ugh, you will not believe what that sleaze-ball from Ralph Lauren did too me!
Okay-okay that-that's amazing. How did you know that?
You got ink on your lip.
Oh. Ohhhhhhhhh....
So what do you say, maybe sometime I hold your gun?
I don't know man, we're really not supposed to do that.
Oh, what can happen? I mean, would you...
Yeah, I'm gonna say no.
Phoebe, do you want to go see a movie after dinner tonight?
Oh we can't, we already have plans.
What are you doing?
Well, same thing we did all day, hang out at Gary's apartment. He is so amazing, we never left the bedroom. But have fun at the movie.
Oh, we're not seeing a movie!
You're not? Then why did you ask us if we wanted to go?
Oh umm, that's because I just wanted to y'know walk in on me and Chandler while we were, y'know, doing it all night. Will you excuse me for just a second?
Yeah!
Okay. Chandler? Can I see you for a second?
Uh, yeah.
Okay. We have got to beat them! {Here we go yet again.}
Why?
'Cause, Gary and Phoebe think they're a hotter couple than we are!
Ohh, so?
So! So we've got to go upstairs and have a lot of sex to prove them wrong!
Monica, you have got to stop this competitive thing! Okay? It's crazy. {Finally! The voice of reason.} I mean, just impress Gary and Phoebe we have to go upstairs and have sex over and over and I'm saying no to this, why? Get your coat.
Hey!
Excuse me. You should check this out, tell the other tenants. Apparently he's running around looking for some kind of a hot girl.
Who isn't?
I don't, I don't think we've meet. I-I'm Ross.
I know. You're the guy who wouldn't chip in for the handyman.
Nevermind!
No, I-I actually thought it was unfair the way everyone reacted. I mean you had just moved in.
I had just moved in. Thank you! Listen umm...
Jen.
Jen, I know this may sound a little... But uh, would you maybe wanna grab a cup of coffee sometime, or...
Sure! That would be nice.
Umm?
Oh! My number is on there. Give me a call.
I will give you a call.
I'll see you later.
Okay!
I forgot my paper.
That was amazing!
Phoebe and Gary are so gonna hear about this at dinner.
That was amazing.
We are the hottest! Huh? No one is hotter than we are! You're the best.
No, you're the best.
No, you're the best.
No, you're the best.
I am the best.
Hey guys! What 'cha been doin'?
Hey Joey! Isn't that the girl that waved at you the other day?
I don't know. But I can see through your sheet. Yeah, yeah, that's her. But y'know what? Doesn't matter, I'm never gonna get to meet her anyway.
Why?
Because it's impossible to find her apartment! She lives in some like of hot girl parallel universe, or something.
What are you talking about? She obviously lives on the second floor, seventh apartment from the left!
No. No. No. She lives on the third floor, eighth apartment from the left.
No, those first two windows, that's the lobby. And y'know the other one over there, that's the stairway. You've been counting wrong.
I did not know that! Thank you Monica. I can't believe I almost lost another girl because of counting.
So uhh, you ready?
Sure, I'll just get my coat. Could you get that?
Sure. Joey...
Dahhhhh!! No! Noooo!!
Ah, first, I-I would like to say thank you for agreeing to see me again.
That's quite all right, but I feel obligated to tell you that this meeting is being videotaped.
Okay. Umm, well, first I would like to start by apologizing for kissing you and uh, for yelling at you.
Fair enough.
Now you're probably going to hire one of the people who did not ah, who did, who did not umm, yell at you and storm out, and I think that's a big mistake and here's why. I made a huge fool of myself and I came back, that shows courage. When I thought you wanted sex in exchange for this job, I said no. That shows integrity. And, I was not afraid to stand up for myself and that shows courage. Okay umm, now I know I already said courage, but y'know you gotta have courage. And umm, and finally when I thought you were making sexual advances in the workplace, I said no and I was not litigious. {By the way, litigious means to want to litigate and litigate is to make a lawsuit against. So she didn't want to sue him. Don't worry, I had to look it up too.} So there you go, you got, you got courage, you got integrity, you got courage again, and not litigious. Look Mr...
Zelner.
Zelner! Right! I knew that! I really, really want this job and I think, I think I would be really good at it.
Y'know what? I may regret this but uh, I'm going to give you a shot.
Oh! You are?
Um-hmm.
Really? Oh thank you! Oh... Oh, would it be completely inappropriate to give you a hug?
Yes!
Okay, well then how about a handshake? Oh God I'm sorry! Oh God, I'm sorry! I did not mean to touch that-I mean you there. There. Uhh, okay, so thank-thank you, I'm going to leave now thank you very much uh-huh, thank you so-Hey! I'll see you Monday!
You tired Chandler?
You better believe he's tired, after the day we had! If you know what I mean. You know what I mean?
Honey, the tortilla chips know what you mean.
So uh Chandler, you like that badge I got you?
Oh yeah, it's so cool. Now I gotta go, Officer Bing has gotta, 10-100. That's pee-pee.
Phoebe, you have a, a twig in your hair.
Ohh, umm, we kinda took a little detour on the way over here.
Yeah, we took a little stroll in the park and no one was around, so...
You didn't!
We did! We violated Section 12 Paragraph 7 of the criminal code!
The park huh? A public place.
Uh-huh.
I hear ya. Excuse me for just a second!
Hi Chandler.
Monica! This is the Men's room! Isn't it?
Yes it is. You see I've always found the men's bathroom very sexual. Haven't you?
No. And if I did, I don't think we'd be going out. Monica, this is getting ridiculous!
Come on, we can't let them win!
Ugh, we have already proved that we are hot! Okay? So why-why are you getting so obsessed about this thing?!
Because Phoebe and Gary are in that-can't-keep-their-hands-off-each-other-doing-it-in-the-park phase!
So?
I feel really sad that we're not...really there anymore.
Oh wow! Is that what this all have been about?
Wasn't it a lot more exciting when we were y'know all over each other all the time?
Yeah that was great. That was really great! But to tell you the truth, I'm more excited about where we are right now.
Really?
Yeah! I've never been in a relationship that's lasted this long before. Y'know to get past the beginning and still be around each other all the time, I think that's pretty incredible. And the fact that this is happening all with you, yeah I think that's pretty exciting.
That is so sweet. I know that I was acting a little crazy but umm, I feel the same way.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Y'know what I just realized? You just freaked out about our relationship.
Did not.
Yes you did! Admit it! You freaked out!
Okay, I freaked out a little.
Little?! You freaked out big time! Okay? And I fixed it! We have switched places! I am the relationship and king and you are the crazy, irrational screw up! And now we're back.
I cannot believe Ross is buying this!
Thank God! I can't watch him anymore!
You guys ready fore the movies?
Yeah! Oh by the way, thank you for loaning us Pamela and Yasmine.
Man! They cannot get enough!
Okay, pick a card.
Okay.
All right now, memorize it. You got it?
Oh yes.
Is that your card?
Yes.
Hey guys!
Hi!
Hi there!
Hi!!
Guess what? Ben is going to be in a TV commercial!
What are you talking about?!
Well, it's not for sure but umm, we met this guy in the park who thought Ben was really cute--y'know, which he is--so umm anyhoo, he uh, he gave us his card and told us to bring him down for this commercial he's auditioning.
Whoa! This guy is like the biggest commercial casting director in town! Ben takes one lousy walk in the park and gets an audition!! I mean, way to go Ben! Man! I've been in that park a million times and no one offered me an audition.
I know, it's crazy! We were just pushing Ben on the swings...
I'm always on the swings! What am I doing wrong?!
That.
Okay, gotta go! Wish me luck!
Luck!
Hey Rach, now that you're working at Ralph Lauren, can you bring me back some of those polo shirts?
Uh well, y'know what? I don't think if I feel comfortable stealing on my very first day...
Unwilling to steal from work, interesting.
Besides, if anybody's gonna get free stuff, it's gonna be me.
Okay guys, way to wish me luck!
Good luck! Go get 'em!
Okay, let's discuss Rachel's birthday. I say we throw a surprise party this weekend.
Whoa-whoa, but her birthday isn't like for another month.
Yeah but if we throw her a party on her birthday, then it's not a surprise.
I think it's a great idea. Yeah, we could have a dinner party and just invite her close friends.
Ross!! We're having a surprise party for Rachel!!
Okay!!
Done.
Okay, great so do you want to do it together?
I would love to do it together!
They're gonna do it together.
Dude! That's my girlfriend!
What, so I gotta shut it down now?
All right, I gotta take off. I'm picking up Ben then we're off to the big audition.
It's gonna be weird to watch some actor pretending to be Ben's dad.
Yeah.
Weirder than watching his two moms make out?
Whoa-whoa dad? There's a dad in the commercial?
Yeah the dad and Ben eat soup and pretend to enjoy it.
Whoa, hey, maybe I'll go down there with ya and see if I can get an audition to play the dad. I mean who better to play Ben's father than his godfather.
You're not his godfather.
What?! Are you kidding?!
Of course I am! Okay, let's go godfather.
All right!
Hey! I'm in, they're gonna let me audition!
Really? That's great!
I know! I know! It turns out that one of the casting ladies has actually seen me in a play, so I steered clear of her...
Hey, that kid looks familiar.
Oh yeah, yeah! He's done tons of commercials. I've seen him in like Sugar Smacks, Playstation, and that one for the phone company. In fact he was so good in that one, he actually convinced me to switch phone companies. Chandler was mad....
Yeah well, he's not gonna get this one. Ben is way cuter than that kid. I mean look at him, look at you,
That's great. Listen, wouldn't it be great though if I got to play Ben's dad?
Joey, you look nothing like Ben.
I look more like him than you do!
Y'know, I don't really know you well enough for you to do that.
So it's down to these two, Nancy I know you like this one and I think I agree. Rachel, what do you think?
Well umm, that one is pretty but uh, I just, I just love this fabric Sorry.
Oh don't be sorry, that's part of your job here to give your opinions and then I take credit for them--I'm kidding.
She is kidding, but don't ever disagree with her again. Okay, now I'm kidding!
Oh, what a fun office.
I don't know which one, but I do know I need a cigarette. So what do you say we take a break, we go outside, and we'll figure this out when we come back?
Rachel? Do you smoke?
Oh no, my dad's a doctor and he would always tell me just horror stories......about ghosts and goblins who totally supported the princess's right to smoke.
...and then they came back from smoking and they had made all of the decisions without me!
That doesn't seem fair.
I know! It's like I'm being punished for not having this disgusting, poisoning habit!
Yeah, it is the best.
I mean what if this keeps happening? Y'know, they'll-they'll be outside smoking, making all the decisions and I'll just be up in my office breathing my stupid clean air, y'know? And then when the day comes when Kim wants to promote one of us, who do you think she's gonna pick? Me or Smokey Smokerson?
Rachel, you can go down there, you don't have to smoke. Just say you wanna get some fresh air.
Yeah, I can do that.
Yeah, or you can do the easy thing and smoke.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey Rach, you wanna get some coffee?
I would love to!
Oh good!
Yeah, I wanna go to babe.
Oh good.
Oh wait, I change my mind! Okay, let's talk about the party! I have so many ideas!
Yeah, me too!
Oh, look at that.
All right, that's a little sketch of the cake, umm some sample menus, umm y'know what I thought we would start out with Tuscan style finger food, and for music, here's an alphabetized list of all my CDs! I've highlighted the ones that would go really good with the food.
What happened to the intimate dinner party?
Oh, we're not doing that. Okay...
So wow, it looks like you took care of everything. Thanks a lot, co-host.
What?! I didn't take care of everything, there's-there's plenty of things for you to do!
Like what?
Cups.
Cups? You're giving me cups?
And ice!
Cups and ice? Ooh, I get to be in charge of cups and ice? All right. Fine, okay, I will be in charge of cups and ice!
Wait a minute, I can get ice at the restaurant...
I got it! Mine!
Hi.
Hey! How'd the audition go?!
Not so good.
Wait a minute, are you doing Joey's "Audition didn't go so well. Yeah it did?"
Yeah I am! Yeah, Ben got a second audition!
Yeah, I had to teach Ross my bit because I actually didn't get a callback.
You got a callback too didn't you?
Yeah I did!
Hey Rachel, what are you doing out here?
Oh well, it's kinda lonely up there, so I just thought I would come out here and get some fresh air.
Nancy and I were talking about the fall collection.
Oh great!
So anyway we really... Honey, we're just smoking all over you.
Oh, sorry!
Oh that's okay.
No-no-no, we'll move you just stay right there.
So anyway I sent the designs over to Ralph and he's very excited about the line.
Oh that's great! You are the best!
Excuse me, can I, can I bum one of those? Y'know what, actually... Okay, okay, okay, what's so funny over here?
I thought you didn't smoke.
Oh, I thought you guys meant marijuana cigarettes, y'know? Y'know what I mean, like dubbies? And I actually, I thought to myself, "Wow, those guys are crazy!" But no, I actually smoke the regular ones all, all the time.
We get high.
Oh, me too.
I'm kidding.
Oh, me too.
Oh God, this is so nerve wracking! How-how do you do this?
Well, unfortunately, I don't get many callbacks so...
Is it a good sign that they asked us to hang around after the audition?
Who knows?
Okay uh, we have narrowed it down to Raymond, Ben, Kyle, and Joey. The rest of you, thank you very much.
Yes!! I knew it!! Bye-bye! So long! Later!
Oh this is great! I might actually get to play Ben's dad!
Yeah!
Actually, that can't happen. Yeah because you all have such different looks, we're putting you with Raymond and Kyle with Ben. So it'll be either you two or you two.
Man, this is gonna be kinda weird.
Yeah, it is.
Yeah. It's gonna be weird.
No, we-we're gonna be like best friends, that's why it's gonna be weird.
Oh, oh, I thought we were just talking.
Hey!
Hi!
Is it okay if I leave this stuff here 'til Rachel's birthday party?
Ah sure. What's in 'em?
Umm, cups.
Oh good, because uh we got Rachel 800 gallons of water.
Seriously that's a lot of cups.
Yeah well, that's 'cause Monica put me in charge of cups and ice, and Monica is gonna rue the day that she put me in charge of cups and ice.
Y'know I rued the day once...didn't get a whole lot else done.
Okay, time to bring up the rest of the cups. Oh, hi Joey!
Hey Pheebs! Hey!
Hey!
Ross good, I'm uh glad you're here. I wanna talk to you about something.
What's up?
Well, I've been thinking about this whole commercial thing, y'know me going up against Ben, the two of us competing, and that can't lead to anything good. So, I think I'm just gonna step aside. I'm gonna tell them that I won't audition.
Wow, uh, Joey that's-that's great. Thanks man.
That's it? You're-you're gonna let me do this?! This-this is my career we're talking about here!
Well, you just...
I just said that so you wouldn't let Ben do it! Look Ross, if anyone should step aside it should be Ben!
What?!
What? Chandler! Tell 'em!
Well I mean, let me get the door first. Oh, hi! No one.
Why should Ben step aside? It was his audition in the first place! You-you just tagged along! You're like the uh, tag-a-long dad.
At least I care about his feelings!
What?!
Do you know how hard this is gonna be on him when he doesn't get it?
And why wouldn't he get it?
Oh, come on! Have you seen what my kid can do?! Huh?! I mean he dials phones! He-he-he eats tortilla chips! He-he plays soccer with the cartoon tiger!
Are you saying your kid eats soup better than my kid?
You just give him a spoon baby!
Oh yeah? I guess we'll just see!
Yeah! Because this commercial belongs to me and Mitch!
You're kid's name is Raymond!
Yeah?! So's yours!
How did work go?
Oh it was great! It was great! I went down there just like you said, y'know? And we talked business. Kim totally took my opinions.
You stink!
Thanks!
No, I'm-I'm serious!
Well-well that's 'cause I went down there and they were all smoking. This is actually the smell of success.
Okay, there's something different though--Oh my God! You smoked!
I did not!
Yes you did! You look happy and sick; you smoked!
All right, fine! But I had too! I had to do it for my career!
I wish I had smoked for my career...
That's so gross!
No well, no it's not that bad, y'know? I mean yeah, my tongue feels a little fuzzy and these fingers sort of smell, I actually feel like I can throw up.
Okay, but you gotta push past this because it is about to get so good!
Chandler! I have to tell you, you smell so smokey I have to get up. I'm not kidding.
I think you smell great!
So, we're decided, no on plaid, yes on pink?
Absolutely!
I am so on board!
Rachel didn't you just light that?
Yeah, I did, but y'know what? I am really, really trying to cut back, y'know? Good luck, Rach.
I've actually been thinking about quitting lately.
Oh sure, every Sunday night I'm telling myself I'm quitting but every Monday morning it's like
Tell me about it!
Well then let's just quit! We'll just quit! Let's all quit!
It does sound appealing.
Oh, I never could do it.
Oh but you could. You can. Absolutely! We can help each other out! We can get--what are those--those patches! We could be like the Patch Sisters!
Oh y'know, we really should quit. Okay, let's quit!
Yes! Great! Give me those cigs! Give it! Give it!
My late husband gave me that lighter. I'm not kidding.
Okay then!
Hmmm, soup! Hmm soup! Hmm, soup!
Joey, Ross is gonna be here any second, would you mind watching Ben for me while I use the ladies' room?
Oh yeah, no problem.
Thanks.
Hi Ben! So you wanna be an actor huh? I gotta tell ya, it's no picnic. There's tons of rejection. No stability. One day you're Dr. Drake Remoray, the next day you're eating ketchup right out of the bottle.
Joey!
Ross!
Ben! I mean, Ben! Ben!
Okay, Raymond, Joey you're up.
Hi!
Okay, uh well, let's try one. Whenever you guys are ready.
Uh-oh.
Is there a problem?
Well this is noodle soup and uh, I've been working with tomato. But that's okay, no problem. No problem. Hmm, noodle soup.
Y'know, that's-that's fine, but the line is, "Hmm, soup."
Oh, what did I say?
Hmm, noodle soup.
How's that different? Oh! Yeah!
All right, let's try one.
Hmm, noodle soup.
Okay. Let's do it again.
Okay.
Hmm, soup. I mean, noodle soup. I mean soup!
COME ON!!!!
Y'know what? We need to move on.
No! No! I-I can do it one more time! See? Look! Hmm, noodle soup. Damnit!
Hey! Hey-hey-hey!!
Uh-oh, busted!
Come on you guys! What are doing?! I thought we were the patch sisters!
Yeah. That didn't work out.
Rachel we tried to quit, but it was too hard!
Well y'know if you, if you started smoking again you could've at least told me! Come on, give me one of those! What are we talking about?
No. No! You're doing great! Don't you give up! That's why we didn't tell you and we're not gonna drag you down with us.
Oh wait, no-no-no! Drag me down. Drag-drag me down.
Forget it Rachel! We're both so proud of how well you're doing. I'm not gonna let you blow it. In fact, if I catch you with a cigarette, you're fired. So go on, get out of here! Go on, I don't want you breathing this stuff! Go on!
Okay.
So, okay! So you'll come with me on the Paris trip.
Oh man!
Check it out! Cup hat! Cup banner! Cup chandelier! And the thing that started it all, the cup!
Great job with the cups, Pheebs!
Why don't you just go out with her!
And did you notice the ice? Look! We have it all! We have crushed! Cubed! And dry! Watch! Ahhh! Mystical!
Awesome!
Chandler! Everyone--no one's eating my Tuscan finger food 'cause they're all filling up on Phoebe's snow cones!
There are snow cones! Snow cones! Yuck!
Y'know...go! Go! Right there!
Thank you! Thank you!
Oh, look! Look! Look!
Surprise!!
What?! What?! My birthday's not for another month!
That's the surprise!
Oh my God! You guys this is so great! I mean it's so unexpected! I mean Chandler's birthday is even before mine!
Surprise!
Wow! This is great! Look at all these cups! This is so weird.
I was in charge of cups.
Oh, okay, not so weird.
Hey!
Hey.
Listen man, uh, I'm sorry the audition didn't go so well.
Yeah right!
No really, I-I am! I feel bad!
Yeah? Well look Ross, you don't have to. Okay? It's not your fault I suck. I mean what kind of an actor can't even say, "Hmm, noodle soup."
Yeah y'know what? Maybe-maybe you didn't mess up your audition because you suck, maybe you messed up because you care more about uh, your godson.
What you do mean?
I think, sub-consciously...
Wait-whoa-whoa, you lost me.
I think on some level, you-you sabotaged your own audition so that Ben would get the part.
Well, you're way sounds a lot better than mine. Yeah. Yeah! It's not that I'm a bad actor...
No!
No, it's just ah, I care so damn much about little Ben that uh, it was more important to see him succeed.
There you go. Thank you!
Thank you! So, did-did he get it?
No.
Eh, what are you gonna do?
Oh, hi! Excuse me, is uh Rachel Green here? I was supposed to meet her for lunch.
Oh, she doesn't come down here any more. You can find her up on ten.
Okay, great.
So we talked about the whole presentation yesterday at lunch and he wondered if one person would be enough to get a take on the trip and I said, "Yeah, absolutely!"
I'll catch you guys later.
Hey!
Hey!
Wow! You look nice. What's the occasion?
Monica and I are celebrating our ten-month anniversary, we've got reservations at Ja George.
Wow! How'd you get in there?
Made a few calls, pulled some strings, and they agreed to seat us at 11:30 if we both had the chicken and didn't get desert.
Hi Chandler!
Hey Caitlin! Somebody got a haircut.
Ugh, I hate it! I look like an 8-year-old boy.
Yeah, if that was true, gym class would've been a lot more interesting.
It's uh, 27 dollars even.
Oh, okay. Here you go.
Hey, where's the chicken?
Oh, he's in the back. The duck pissed him off, said that eggs came first.
Great. I'll see you later!
Okay, bye!
What the hell was that?!
What?
The flirting! Aren't you supposed to be going out with, I don't know hmm, let's say my sister?!
I was not flirting.
It was totally flirting. "Somebody got a haircut "
Okay first of all, the impression, uncanny. And second, that was not flirting, that was just casual conversation between two people. That is all.
Yeah, right.
You wanna see flirting? I'll show you flirting.
I'm good.
I am so proud of Joey, I can't believe he's going to be on Law & Order!
I know. But don't you think that it should be called Order and Law?
No because first they arrest the guy and then they try him.
Don't get me started on that.
I was not flirting.
And on your anniversary, for shame!
What's going on?
Chandler was hitting on the hot delivery girl!
I was not and oh God, shh!
Well I'm sorry but you were! Okay? And besides if anyone should be hitting on her it's the guy who's single, the guy that who-who-who can do something about it.
Sounds like somebody wants to be Mr. Pizza Delivery Girl.
Well...
Is that what this is about? You like Caitlin?
Ross! We broke up two years ago; you've been married since then. I think it's okay that we see other people.
Well, I-I was watching her the other day at the pizza place.
Hm-mmm.
And she's just so sexy and funny and has the cutest little...
Okay, y'know what? We don't need her measurements.
Okay pepperoni, pepperoni, pepperoni, okay Ross, I know she's pretty and you love her, but is she stupid?! She forgot my vegetarian!
This is perfect! She'll have to come back here with your pizza, and when she does, I'll turn on the Charm-O-Ross. Oh I'm so glad you don't eat meat.
See? Vegetarianism benefits everyone.
Hey everybody, look who's here! You remember my grandmother!
Big night!
This is so cool!
So, Joey on Law & Order, you must be very proud!
Chandler, she doesn't understand a word of English.
I'm sorry, I thought you were Joey's other grandmother. I've done it again.
She's my biggest fan. Yeah, she's the only one in the family that's believed in me.
Yeah, I uh weighted like 27 pounds when I was born so...
Hey! Happy Anniversary!
Happy Anniversary, 10 months!
So umm, when I was in the shower I was thinking about our first night in London...
Uhh, Joey's grandmother is right there.
Is that the one that speaks English or the one that doesn't?
The one that doesn't.
That was some hot love you gave me! I'm gonna go get ready.
Hey, why don't you wear those earrings I gave you?
That's a great idea! I was saving them for something special.
Okay.
You have got to go home!
But I like it here!
You gotta go home and get the earrings that you borrowed from me okay? Chandler wants me to wear them tonight.
Okay, well I think that they're in my purse. Why don't you go get dressed and I'll look for them.
Great!
Okay! Rach, hi, I need those earrings you borrowed.
Oh, umm, okay, yeah, I'll be, yeah I'll be right back.
Wow Pheebs, you speak Italian?
I guess so.
Here you go. Thank you!
Wait, Rach! Where's the other one?
Oh what, you-you want both of them?
Rachel Karen Green, where's the other earring?!
Okay, okay, okay, look, just don't freak out, but I kinda lost it. I know it's in the apartment, but I definitely lost it.
Well, what am I going to tell Monica? She wants to wear them tonight!
Tell her to wear her own earrings.
These are her earrings.
Nooo! Nooooo! You lent me Monica's earrings?! I'm not allowed to borrow her stuff!
Why not?
Because I lose her stuff!
Okay, see that blind guy right there? I'm gonna bash his head in later.
Oh umm, my big scene is coming up. Big scene coming up.
If you said, "Big lima bean, bubbling up." Would she understand the difference?
Rach? What are you doing?
Oh boy, I just can't watch. It's too scary!
It's a diaper commercial.
Oh yeah well, you know me, babies, responsibilities, ahhh!!!
Pizza delivery!
I'll get it! I will get that!
Hi!
Hi!
One uh, vegetarian pizza. That's $12.15.
Oh. Uh, by the way, if it makes you feel any better. I happen to like 8-year-old boys.
What?!
The uh, your hair, before, your hair, you said you thought your looks like an 8-year-old's, and I'm just saying I like it. The hair.
Oh. Thanks.
You understand I don't actually like 8-year-old boys.
Y'know, all I'm looking for is the money.
Here you go. Now stop bringing us pizzas you.
I'm gonna try.
You're welcome.
You couldn't let me have her, could ya?!
What?
This is a girl that I really like and had too swoop in there!
What's goin' on?
Chandler was totally flirting with the hot delivery girl!
Thank you for that! I was not flirting.
It's okay. I don't care. It's uh, it's fine.
Really?!
Really?!
It's no big deal, I do it all the time.
So umm, you-you flirt with guys all the time?
Sure! It doesn't mean anything! Just like I know it doesn't mean anything with you!
Okay, but there is a big difference. You are a lot hotter than I am.
True story!
Chandler, this actually bothers you?
Yes, it does bother me! And I think it would bother a lot of people. Rachel, when you were going out with Ross, did it bother you when he flirted with other women?
Uhh, no, no, it bothered me when he slept with other women.
And thank you, for that.
But y'know, I never really had anything to worry about. Ross was never very good at the flirting thing.
What? What-what, what are talking about? It-it worked with you.
Oh! Y'know what? You're right! We meet, you flirted and then bamn nine years later you had me!
All right, all right. You-you-you know what I'm going to do? I am going to order another pizza and when Caitlin gets here, you-you--I will show how well I flirt. Yeah! I will, I will get her phone number! And not the one on the menu!
I found it!
Ohh! Thank God! Where was it?
On your dresser.
Okay that is the one we already have!
Okay, here's my big scene. My big scene's here! Oh my God.
What?
Okay, everybody just keep smiling. It'll kill my grandmother if she finds out.
Well, what is it?
Oh, they cut me out of the show.
What?!
Are you sure?
Maybe your scene's coming up?
Not likely. 'Cause you see that body bag right there
Yeah.
I'm in it.
This is terrible, what are you going to do?
I don't know. This little, old lady lives for my career. When they dumped me off of Days of Our Lives she almost died.
That's not good.
No, smile! Not that face, smile! Everybody smile!
Joey, why don't you just tell her what happened? It's not your fault.
If we keep talking this way, aren't we gonna freak her out soon?
Soon, soon, I'm gonna be on soon. There I am!
No! Sam Waterston!
No-no-no, that-that's me, that's me.
No, it's Sam Waterston! Crimes and Misdemeanors, Capricorn One.
Doesn't know, "Hello." But she knows Capricorn One.
Phoebe! I have to have those earrings, we're going to leave as soon as the show is over.
But I already gave them back to you!
No you didn't.
All right, I already didn't give them back to you, that's what I said. Where is that other earring?
It's not here Pheebs, it's not here. Ohh, I went to Joey and Chandler's last night! Okay!
Make sure you check Chandler's jewelry box.
Wait a minute. Chandler has a jewelry box?
Okay, we have like ten minutes. Do you want me to get into that now?!
Hey Pheebs! How's that uh, vegetarian pizza working out for ya? You and those vegetables have a real thing going on, huh?
Why are you being weird?
Do you like it?
No, that would be, "Why are you being cute?"
Okay, I'm working on my flirting.
Ohh! I did not get that.
So uh Monica, do you, do you like the Law & Order?
Yeah, it's good.
See, I'm finding out all this stuff about you today, like you like the Law & Order and that you flirted with every guy in the Tri-State area!
Chandler! Okay, let me get this straight, it's okay for you to flirt, but not for me.
Oh, I'm so glad we cleared that up. Look, I'm sorry, some things are different for men and for women.
Go on, teach me something about men and women.
Okay, I've already taught you so much already, but whatever. See when you flirt with a guy you think, "I'm just flirting, no big deal." But the guy is thinking, "Finally! Somebody who wants to sleep with me!"
No way!
It's true.
Well that's pathetic!
Again true.
And this goes for all guys?
All guys that are awake. Then we go to sleep and then all the guys from the other end of the world wake up and behave the exact same way.
All right, it's another commercial; I still haven't told her!
Joey! This is like the last commercial. You've got like ten minutes left!
I know, I know! What am I going to do? Ooh!
No! You are not gonna run out and leave her here!
Yeah, all right. Ooh!
Joey!
Uh, Joey is gonna be right back. Right back! Meanwhile, let's-let's-let's talk about you. So, you're old and small.
Hey!
Did you find it?
The earring? No. But look, I found my sunglasses under the couch! I've been looking for these since like last summer.
Okay, those are my sunglasses, you borrowed them from me.
Okay, calm down, here they are.
Phoebe!
What are we going to do?!
I don't know, I don't know.
All right well, we're just gonna have to tell Monica, that's all.
Oh gosh, she's going to kill me.
I suppose I could tell her it's just all my fault.
Ohh that'd be great!
Mon, can I talk to you for a sec?
Yeah, what is it?
Umm, I lost one of your earrings. I'm sorry! I am so, so sorry!
Wow! All right well, I mean, what can you do? If you lost it you lost it.
I will replace it, I promise. I feel so terrible.
All right, sweetie that's fine. You didn't do it on purpose.
No.
Look at you! Come here! Feel better?
Yeah! You're the best!
Okay, wait a minute. Wait a minute, I-I-I, I can't do this. Listen honey, this is, it's not Phoebe's fault. She lent me the earrings, and I lost it. I'm so sorry. Honey, I feel terrible too.
That is exactly why I do not lend you stuff!! Okay?! I mean, first it's my jewelry! And if it's not my jewelry, it's-it's my blue sweater! And if it's not my sweater, it's my sunglasses!
Your sunglasses?!
Yes!
Oh, right!
Pizza!
Oh, mine! Mine! Mine! Okay, here goes. Prepare yourselves for some Class A flirting.
Okay, hold on. Okay.
Honey, you have nothing to prove. And if you really like this girl, I don't flirting is the right thing to...
You'll see. Okay. Oh, what's-what's her name?
Caitlin!
Caitlin!
Hey! Oh, we-we can't keep eating like this.
It's uh, $12.50.
Okay, so, do you make the pizzas in one of those uh, wood-burning ovens?
No actually umm, I think that they're umm, gas.
Gas? Wow! Intense.
If this is the way all the Gellers flirt, we don't have a problem.
Hey uh, y'know that smell gas has?
Yeah.
They put that in.
What?!
The gas is odorless, but they add the smell so you know when there's a leak.
Well okay!
A lot of other gas smells...
Oh the humanity.
Meth-methane smells...
Y'know what umm, actually I, I really, I should go.
Oh but I-I-I haven't paid you yet!
Y'know what? That's okay, you guys have ordered so many that this one is on me!
Was I talking to her about gas?
More so than anything else.
I-I-I found it interesting.
I'm sorry.
Look, no-no, hey, hey, don't worry about it! In nine years, she and I will be right there.
Okay, well, I'm gonna clear out some of these boxes.
Ross?
Yeah?
What else do they add smell too?
Hey! Hey! Hi! Hey-hey-hey, I'm Rachel! From upstairs? The ones with all the pizza?
Oh, is there a problem?
No. No. Every thing's--they're fine. Great pizza. But it's uh, actually umm my friend Ross. He uh, just gets really nervous when he's flirting.
Oh my God! That was flirting?!
Yeah.
Wow!
I know, I know, but uh just, I'm telling you, once, once you get past that part, that where it-it just feels like you wanna die, he's-he's really a good person.
The guy with the gas?!
Yeah. I'm-I'm telling you he's really sweet and he's really funny and he's just ugh, got a good heart. And besides, I y'know, I think he really likes you.
Really?!
Well y'know, we have 7 people and like 10 pizzas, what do you think?
I just, I thought Joey was there.
Hey Ross? Umm, I just ran into Caitlin in the hallway and-and uh, you must be getting better at this flirting stuff than I thought.
What do you mean?
Well, I don't get it, but she wanted me to give you her phone number.
And she just gave you this?
Yeah!
Rach, thanks but uh, I don't need you doing me any favors.
I-I-I didn't! I didn't! She thought you were cute.
Well that I can believe.
Yay!
Hey! Is the show still on?
Almost over man.
Look! Oh! Is that the Pope?!
Why am I looking?
Oh, here I am, here's my big scene!
All right back off! I gotta gun! I'm not afraid to use it!
Oh Joey!
That's right!
You couldn't have at least changed your shirt.
Now, I wanna a suitcase filled with 100,000 dollars. Choo! Choo! Choo! Filled with $100,000 in small bills, and if I don't get it... Choo!! And if I don't get it, I'm gonna shoot this duck!
Oh no!
I'm comin' out!
And she's supposed to buy this?!
Joey, bravo!
Ground control to Major Tom! Commencing countdown...engines...on!
That's uh, scenes from next week's show. Next week's!
I am definitely gonna watch that!
What about these? These look the same?
Definitely!
Not as each other!
Oh, then no.
Hey!
Hi!
You ready?
Yeah.
You look amazing. I'm the luckiest man in the world.
Ohh, you're about to get a little luckier.
Let me see the earrings.
Oh, honey, the earrings...
They look great! Does your boyfriend have the best taste or what?
My boyfriend really does have good taste!
Thanks for picking out the earrings man.
Hm-mmm.
Okay, guys, listen, don't forget that tomorrow is the day that Emily gets married again, so whatever we do, just try to really keep Ross's mind off of it.
Oh, yeah, good idea.
Hey man, what's up?
Oh, eh, just thinking about Emily getting married tomorrow.
Ooh, Ross, look! Look!
What? Where?
Right over there! Right there! Look-look-look!
What am I looking at?
Somebody help me out here!
Hey!
Hello!
Hey!
How are you?
Monica, I'm sorry I didn't come by last night. I was out with Gary; he let me ride around with him in his cop car. We saw and prevented crimes.
You got to go on a ride along?!
Uh-huh!
I want to go on a ride along!
Me too!
Okay!
Yeah, yeah! Me too!
Really?! You?
Yeah.
Well, it's kinda dangerous.
Well, I like danger.
Okay, you guys free tonight?
Yeah!!
Tonight? You-you didn't say it was going to be at nighttime.
Hey!
Hey! Oh, I'm so glad you're home, I thought tonight we could finally organize these photos!
Ohh, thank God! Finally!
Okay, I've broken them down into categories. Okay, we have uh, we got holidays, birthdays, candids, y'know... And then what I've done is I've cross-referenced them by subject. Right? So if you're looking up, oh let's say birthdays and dogs, you get Photo 152. See?
Ohh, it's me and La Poo! Wow! I miss that dog.
You can also find him under umm, dog and dead.
Great! Thanks!
All right, hand me that other box of photos; that's the very last one.
Okay.
Oops. Sorry! Well, good thing you number all of them, huh?
I hadn't! Photo 152 was a prototype.
Ohhhh. Honey, honey, honey, it's okay, it's okay honey. I'm gonna fix you a drink, huh? Maybe a margarita?
Ross has the blender! Ugh, everything's just falling apart!
No honey, it's okay! Listen, I'll got to Ross's and get the blender, you get all the margarita stuff ready.
All right, he's keys are in the drawer. Y'know what? I also need some cash.
Okay, you want me to stop at the ATM?
Nah, while you're at Ross's if you see any lying around...
What?!
What?! I-I-I don't, I don't do that!
That was so cool man, the way you leaned on that guy.
It is starting to get dark out there.
He told you everything! I mean you totally cracked him!
Yeah well, being that he was the victim, they're usually pretty talkative.
Okay. But it is officially nighttime.
Oh hey, Gary, want me to grab the berry for ya?
It's called the cherry.
It's the-Chandler!!
Okay, I got it! This place makes the best sandwich in the world!
Hey Joe does it have meatballs on it?
Oh-ho, yeah!
Does it have melted cheese and marinara sauce?
Yep!
Yeah, you can't eat that in my car.
Yeah okay. Even though my tax dollars paid for this car.
Your tax dollars?
Yeah, okay.
Wow! That sandwich really does smell good.
Did I say you could smell it?!
I can't smell your sandwich?
Half the taste is in the smell! You-you're sucking up all the tastiness!
Okay, I'll give them back. Look! What is so great about that sandwich?
Okay, imagine the best sex you've ever had.
Okay.
Are you thinking about Monica?
Yeah.
Yeah, what's that like?
Ohh please don't be from a real dinosaur! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Made in Mexico! Yes!! Ugh, who would buy this?!
Rach! It's me! Pick up!
Hey! What's up?!
I need a few more things to make the margaritas. Uhh, I need some salt, some margarita mix, and tequila.
So all we have is ice?
See if he has ice.
Okay.
Hello Ross? It's Emily. I know this is out of the blue but uh, I'm getting married tomorrow. Well, maybe I am. I keep thinking about you and I'm wondering if-if we made a mistake giving up so fast. Are you thinking about me? Of course you're not, but if you are, call me tonight. Okay, bye.
Oh. Oh!
So where are we going next?
This witness won't return my calls so we're gonna see if we can surprise him coming home.
Sur-surprise him? We're not, we're not gonna make anybody mad are we?
Come on man! Listen so uh, are you gonna squeeze the perps shoes a little bit before he lawyers up?
It's a witness not a perp. And no one talks like that!
Yeah, no one talks like that!
Oh what? Like your Mr. Cop!
Hey, I'm more cop than you two!
How do you figure that?
Hello! I'm in the front seat, okay? I'm Gary's partner!
Y'know, when you say partner it doesn't sound cop. It, it sounds gay.
Umm, jealous!
Hey, do you mind? We're under cover here.
Yeah, no problem.
Ross!
Sorry! Sorry! Oh, there! Hey Gary, who am I? Phone home!
Look at Officer Ross riding back here with the visitors.
Yeah, what's up with that Serpico?
Are you thinking about me? Of course you're not, but if you are, call me tonight. Okay, bye.
Nooo!
I know!
Well thank God you were here! I mean, we have to erase that!
What?! We can't do that!
We have too! I mean what if Ross's hears that and then calls her back and then they get back together? Is that what you want? Ross back with that controlling, neurotic, crazy Emily? The Emily that wouldn't let him see you?
Noo! Oh no! No! God no! He should not get back together with her. I know that! You know that! Even Ross knows that! But that still doesn't give us the right to erase his message!
I'm his sister, okay? I love him! I don't want to see him get hurt! Come on! Doesn't that give me the right to control him-help him?
I don't think he's the one who needs help.
No, look, she's obviously unstable, okay? I mean she's thinking about running out on her wedding day. Okay, fine! But I mean, look at the position she's putting him in! What's he gonna do? Ross is gonna run over there on the wedding day and break up the marriage?! I mean, who would do that?! Okay, fine, all right, but that's y'know, it's different! Although it did involve a lot of the same people.
Ugh!
Y'know what, this is obviously some kind of twisted joke she's trying to play on him.
Okay, you are crazy! I'm sorry, but she sounded generally upset! I mean, listen!
Your messages have been erased.
Noooooooo!
Okay, y'know, we-we're safe right? I mean nothing bad can go down!
No. But that reminds me, sign this.
What is it?
Oh it's nothing, it just says that you can't sue the city if you scrap your knee or y'know, get your head blown off.
Oh, hurry up. I want to sign that.
Okay, here he comes. What is he doing? What the hell is he doing?!
What? What? What? What is it?
Is everything okay?
What's going on?
Okay, he sees us. Now don't move. Don't look at him.
Hey, it's okay. It was just a car backfire. Hey, look at that! You tried to save your buddy. You see that? You see what he did?
You okay man?
Uh-huh. Thank Joey!
Uh, HELLO!!
Hi.
All right, I guess we should go.
No, wait. Wait.
Oh yeah right!
No, Monica! Monica! We have to fix this!
There's nothing we can do. You erased the message!
Yeah well unless we tell him.
Well, if you're gonna be totally rational about this, I can't argue with you! All right? Fine, if you wanna tell him, tell him. I just don't want to be a part of it.
Oh, maybe that's Emily calling back to leave the exact same message.
Hey Ross! It's you! I just want you to remember this feeling. You are lucky to be alive! So live everyday to the fullest. Love yourself, okay? Okay. Oh, and also get stamps. Bye!
Wow! Play that message for Emily and this whole problem goes away!
Right?
Hey, anybody want to meet a hero?
John Glenn is here?!
No, Joey!
Pheebs, we had the most incredible night! Okay, so, we're in the car...
Wait! Hold on! Hi!
Hi!
Okay, go ahead.
Okay, okay, so we're in the car. Right? And bang! A shot was fired. And Joey with no regard for his own safety throws himself on me!
My God, Joey!
It was a car backfire!
Yeah, but-but he didn't know that!
Yeah, I didn't know that.
And it could've just as easily have been a bullet.
Hey Joe, you ever think about joining the force? We could use a guy like you.
Who jumps at loud noises!
Wow! I could've died tonight.
Yeah! If the car that backfired had run over you! Y'know what, I think I'll go home before Ross starts rambling about his newfound respect for life.
I do have a newfound respect for life.
Oh my God!
So you wanna get some dinner?
Yeah! Sure! Yep! Oh, y'know what? If I heard a shot right now, I'd throw my body on you.
Oh yeah? Well maybe you and I should take a walk through a bad neighborhood.
Okay!
All right.
Bye!
Bye!
Cut it out Ross! I hate to have to save your life and kick your ass in the same day!
Dude! How come you took off?
Oh, I just went for a walk, around the living room. Whatever...
Is something wrong?
No. No I'm just tired. Y'know, from-from the walk.
Okay.
You dove in front of Ross! Ross!
That's what this is about! Oh my God, you hate Ross!
I do not hate Ross!
Of course you do! I saved him! You're mad at me! It all adds up! You want Ross out of the picture.
What picture?
I don't know, but I don't like what I'm hearing!
Look I'm very glad that you saved Ross from the car backfire, but y'know, it could've been a bullet and you y'know, you didn't try to save me!
Ohh, you're upset because you think I chose Ross over you! No! I...knew...you could take care of yourself. Y'know, I mean Ross, he need help. He's not street like us!
When it comes down to it, you would risk your life for Ross before you would for me. That's the bottom line.
Well, no, not exactly! All right, look, I, I wasn't trying to save Ross. Okay? My sandwich was next to Ross. All right? I was, I was trying to save my sandwich.
From a bullet!
I know it doesn't make much sense...
Much sense?!
Look Chandler, it was instinct! Okay? I just went for it!
So you risked your life, for a sandwich!
I know it sounds crazy, but Chandler this is the greatest sandwich in the world!
So you didn't uh, choose Ross before me.
No! I would never do that! You-you're like my brother!
Really?!
Yeah! In fact, to prove how much you mean to me, here.
Thanks.
No, eh, oh-oi, easy, it's not a hot dog!
How good is that?
Oh-oi-ho, yeah!
See?
Hm-hmm.
Oh-whoa-hey, dude, what are you doing?!
I thought you were showing me how much you mean to me.
Yeah. With a bite! Gee-e-e-eez!
Hey! Hi!
Rach, what uh, what are you doing here?
Hey! Y'know what? You are in our apartment all the time! Okay? This is, this is just a drop in the bucket mister!
Y'know, it-it doesn't matter. The important thing is that you're here. You're my friend, and you're here. Oh!
Okay, just a little scared. What's going on Ross?
The most amazing thing happened tonight. I thought my number was up. I had an actual near death experience!
What?! What? What happened?!
Okay, okay, we were on the ride along with Gary, right?
Yeah!
And somebody took a shot at me!
Really?!
No, a car backfired, but I thought somebody was taking a shot at me. And Rach, I...I survived! And I was filled with this-this great respect for life. Y'know? I-I want to experience every moment. I want to seize every opportunity. I-I am seeing everything so-so clearly now.
Because a car backfired?
Okay, why are you here?
Well, I-I-I don't know how this fits into your whole "seizing" thing but um, Emily called you today.
You talked to her?
No, she left a message. But it-it kinda got erased. There's just something wrong with your machine.
Well, okay, what-what did she say?
Well, uh something about having second thoughts about the wedding and did you guys make a mistake breaking up and uh, she wants you to call her.
Wow!
Now, that-that was a good thing that I told you, right?
Huh? Yeah! Yes, of course!
Okay. Thank you! Thank you! Because-I'm sorry, all right. Because y'know what? She didn't want me-not important. The point is, I was right. Your decision. Okay? I was right. Your decision.
Right. I guess, I guess I should call Emily.
Okay, no, that's not the right decision. That's not, that's not right, no Ross-Ross, come on! I mean, that woman made you miserable! Okay, Ross, do you really want to get back into that?
Okay, look, yesterday I would've even considered calling her back, but my ex-wife calls on the same day I have a near death experience. I mean, that-that has got to mean something!
Ugh, Ross! That was not a near death experience! That was barely an experience!
You weren't there! Okay, maybe this is something that I-I'm supposed to seize! Y'know?
Okay, y'know what? Maybe, this is not about seizing stuff. Maybe this is about escaping stuff.
Huh.
I mean, look-look today you escaped death, y'know? And maybe this is a chance for you to escape getting back together with Emily?
That does make sense. Because I do wanna seize some opportunity, but I-I really don't wanna see or talk to her.
Well, there you go!
Yeah. Maybe today is just, close call day.
Close call day.
Hey, thanks Rach.
Ohh, honey no problem. Okay.
Oh wait-wait-wait! The message is blinking. Maybe you didn't erase it.
Oh?
"Hey Ross, it's you!" Oh yeah, no that's-that's an old message, nobody needs to hear that.
No.
Hey umm, was-was Monica here?
Yeah.
Yeah, I want my money back.
Yeah, uh you-you probably need that for stamps, right?
Hey Pheebs, has Gary ever been shot at for real?
Yes. Once. Yeah, a little. He kinda did it to himself. It's not really a good story.
I wonder how I would react under fire, y'know? And not backfire but-but heavy fire, like I was in a war or something.
Man, I would be great in a war! I mean, I really, I think I would make a fantastic military leader. I mean I know I would make General way before any of you guys.
Before or after you were shot by your own troops?
I know where Joey would be. He would be down in the foxhole protecting all of us.
Yes, if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches.
Yeah, hero sandwiches.
Well you all know that I'm a pacifist so I'm not interested in war in any way. But y'know what? When the revolution comes, I will have to destroy you all. Not you Joey.
Would you like some more coffee, baby-doll?
I'm fine, thanks.
Yeah, see, I can't pull of baby-doll can I?
No. I think we learned that from the sugarlips incident. I'm gonna get some tea.
Okay.
Hiya doin' pumpkin?
Nope.
So it looks like it's going really well for you two, huh?
I know, really well. In fact, I'm gonna ask Phoebe to move in with me.
Oh my God!
What do you, what do you think?
I think that is so great! When are you gonna ask her?
Tonight, but don't say anything. Okay?
I swear, I promise. I promise. Oh my God, I'm so excited! {And I just can't hide it! I'm about to lose control and I think I like it! Sorry, just couldn't resist it.} All right, listen let me tell you, do not get her flowers. Okay? Because y'know, she cries when they die, and there's the whole funeral...
I'll see you after work sweetie.
Okay. Bye!
So, what movie should we see?
Gary's gonna ask you to move in with him!!
What?! Really?!
He just told me at the counter. He made me promise not to tell, but I couldn't hold it in any longer!
I can't believe this!
Right, because it's fast. Because, it's so fast. It's fast!
Relax! It's Phoebe! Not you!
Oh! Good for you Pheebs, way to go!
No, but it is fast. Isn't it?
Ohhhh!
No, I like him a lot but I don't think I'm ready for this!
So, what are you gonna do?
I don't know. I'll just handle it-I'll ask you to talk to him!
Me?! Why me?
Because you are so afraid of commitment! You talk to him, make him scared like you! Make him a...man!
I'll try, but I'm not sure what good it would do, y'know? Because I'm a lot less afraid of commitment than I used to be.
That is so sweet!
Still terrified, I'll take care of it. No problem.
Hey Ross, is uh, is Staten Island really an island?
Uh-huh, that's why they call it Staten Island.
Ohhh. I thought it was like Long Island.
Also an island.
Hey, what time is it?
2:17.
Wow! You realize that we've been throwing this ball, without dropping it, for like an hour?
Are you serious?!
Yeah. I realized it about a half-hour ago but I didn't want to say anything 'cause I didn't want to jinx it.
Wow! We are pretty good at this! Hey! We totally forgot about lunch!
Oh, I-I, I think that's the first time I ever missed a meal! Yeah, my pants are a little loose!
Hey, you guys...
Hey!
Is Monica here?
No.
All right listen umm, I just bought something I'm not sure she's gonna like it, and it's gonna seem a little crazy, but this is something that I wanted since I was a little girl.
You bought Shawn Cassidy!
Noo! I wish! Okay, you ready?
Yeah!
Okay! Check it out!
What-what is it?!
What the hell is that?!!
It's a, it's a cat!
That, is not a cat! {I have to agree with Joey on this one.}
Yes it is!
Why is it inside out?!
Excuse me! But this is a purebred, show-quality Sphinx cat!
How much did you pay for that?
Well, it was a little extravagant, but I a pretty good deal.
Yeah? How much?
A thousand bucks.
ON A CAT??!!!!
It's not a cat!
All right listen ball boys! My grandmother had one of these when I was a little girl and it was the sweetest thing! I mean it was so cute, it would sit in my lap and purr all day long, and I would drag a shoestring on the ground and he would chase it!
Free cats do that too, y'know. {Which reminds me, if I might get a little political here, support your local animal shelter. Pet shops are not the place to buy dogs and cats from, you get a much better deal from the shelter, plus they probably won't die on you in a week and a half. If you want a leash, go to the pet shop. If you want the dog for that leash, go to the shelter and save it's life. Now back to regularly scheduled programming.}
It's not a cat!
Ugh! Look you guys, I'm really excited about this! Okay? I don't care what you think! I'm gonna go set up a little litter box for Mrs. Whiskerson. Well, what am I gonna call her? Fluffy?!
Hey, you wanna get something to eat or uh, do you wanna see how long we can throw this ball back and forth? Huh?
Uhh, the ball thing.
Yeah?
Hey Ross, wouldn't it be great if we could go two straight hours without dropping it?!
Uhh, yeah it would! Let's do it!
Okay!
Uh-oh.
What?
I have to pee. And Rachel's in the bathroom!
Man, I didn't think we were gonna make it!
I know! Don't switch hands, okay?
Hey ladies! What are you in here for?
Hey Chandler, what are you doing here?
Gary, I'm here to report a crime.
Yeah?
It is a crime that you and I don't spend more time together.
What's up?
Well, I heard that you thinking about asking Phoebe to move in with you and I thought maybe, we should have a talk. Man to uh, me.
Sure. Okay.
Uh, are you crazy? Are you insane? If you live with Phoebe, you two are gonna be y'know, live-living together!
Yeah, I-I considered that. I just know it would make me happy.
You mean scared.
No, I mean happy.
Scared? Happy?
Chandler, what-what are you doing?
I am trying to open your eyes, my man! Don't you see, if you lived with Phoebe she's always gonna be there. You're gonna get home, she's there. You go to bed, she's there. You wake up and oh yes, she's there!
I know! I can't wait!
Were you're parents happy, or something?
Listen Chandler, the way I see it is that I was lucky enough to find someone that I really love. I just-I wanna be around her as much as I can.
Wow, y'know when you say it, it doesn't sound so scary.
So you know what I'm talking about, right?
Yeah, I think I do! Y'know what? You move in with her! You move in with her right now! Maybe I should in with Monica!
No, it's too soon for you guys.
Yeah, you're right about that.
...now when they found the remains of the Mesozoic Mastodon they discovered what appeared to be the remains of a Paleozoic Amphibian in its jaws! How did it get there?!
Maybe this should be more of a quiet game.
Hey guys!
Hi!
Joey, I left my watch on the counter last night. It was right here, where is it?
I don't know.
All right, come on, I'm-I'm late for work!
How do you know? You don't have a watch.
Guys, could you please just stop throwing the ball for one minute and just help me find it!
Oh, I don't know.... Yeah, can't do it.
What?!
Monica, whatever you do, do not drop that ball!
Yeah, we haven't dropped it in...
2 hours, 27 minutes.
Really?!
I-I'm not gonna be able to make it into work today, I don't feel very good. Yes!! Wow! Uh, for a second there I thought I was really better, but I'm not.
Hey Rach!
Hey.
Check it out! Almost 3 hours without droppin' it!
Oh, wow! Congratulations, that's quite a waste of time.
Rach?
Yeah?
You have scratches all over you, what happened?
Well, it's my cat.
What?!
Oh yeah, I got a cat.
I don't want a cat!
Oh, don't worry, it's not a cat.
Yeah.
You guys this cat is nothing like my grandmother's cat. I mean, it's not sweet, it's not cute, I even dragged that little string on the ground, and it just flipped out and scratched the hell out of me. And I swear, I know this sounds crazy, but every time this cat hisses at me I know it's saying, "Rachel!"
Doesn't sound as crazy as paying a thousand dollars for a cat.
What?! You paid a thousand dollars for a cat when you owe me 300!!
Well, I was gonna let you play with it.
Hi!
Hmm, did you talk to Gary about the moving in thing?
Yes I did, and I think you should do it.
What?!
He's a great guy, y'know? And he loves you a lot, you are a very lucky lady.
You are useless! Freaking out about commitment is the one thing you can do! The one thing! And you can't even do that right! God!
I'm sorry. If you ask me, I'd move in with him.
Ohh!! God! Ooh! Get out of here, good for nothing.
Hey Chandler.
Hey Gar!
Hi sweetie. Hi, can I talk to you for a second?
Yeah! Okay.
You look very pretty today.
Thanks! Okay.
Here's the thing.
Yeah?
Y'know I really want to move this relationship forward.
Uh-hmm.
Because if you're not moving forward, y'know you're just moving backwards.
No that's not true. If you're not moving forward, you're just staying still. And staying still is good. Watch this.
Phoebe?
Yeah?
I want you to move in with me.
That is so sweet. But don't you think it's a little too soon? I mean there's so much we don't know about each other.
Oh. Oh-oh-okay, I get it.
I just-I don't want us to jump into something we're not ready for.
Uh-huh.
I really don't want to mess up what we have. I'm just-I'm worried it's gonna be a big mistake.
Yeah.
Which is why my answer is yes!
Really?!
Uh-huh! I'm so...happy.
Monica! Stop throwing it so hard! We're on the same team!
Four hours? You guys have been doing this for four hours?
That's right baby.
All right, let me in.
No-no! Don't do it! Don't!
What?
He's a dropper!
Oh yeah, that's right!
I'm not a dropper!
It's really a uh-uh three person game, y'know?
It's throwing and catching!
All right.
Oh! Oh! That's so hard.
Whoa-whoa you guys, it's not a cat!
Oh my-Oh good God!
I give up you guys, I don't know what I'm going to do with this thing!
Baking it didn't help, huh?
So, why don't you just take it back to where you got it?
I tried! They won't take her back.
Maybe that's because she's a minion of the anti-Christ.
Rach, why won't they take it back?
Well, they said would but they would only give me store credit. I mean, what am I going to do, get a thousand regular cats?
Look, if you want you can keep it at our place until you find out what to do with it.
No Mon that's not the point. I'm out a thousand dollars, I'm all scratched up, and I'm stuck with this stupid cat that looks like a hand!
Oh my God, the cat's made my eyes water! Don't-don't throw it to me! My vision's been compromised!! Oh God! Okay. Okay. It's okay. Man, that was close.
Yeah, you almost overreacted to something.
Hey!
Hey!
We have great news!
We're moving in together! Isn't it great! Yay!
Congratulations! Congrats!
I know, I'm so excited!
So am I!
Well, you're not more excited than I am! No way! I'm the most excited!
Okay, I'll see you at the station later.
Okay, yeah, I'll see you later! Don't forget about the moving in!
All right.
So you're moving in with him. What happened?
I couldn't tell him no. He got so sad. Maybe it'll be all right. I do really like him a lot and probably do it eventually anyway and plus, think of all the money I'll save on stamps.
Why, do you write him a lot?
No, I just heard when people live together, they split the cost of stamps. Don't they?
Yeah! That's right. Yeah-yeah! Yeah!
Oh, I'm sorry, the oven mitts really freaked me out.
Hey, honey! Okay, so did you find any apartments? Anything in Brooklyn Heights?
No, nothing.
Oh really?
Yeah.
Nothing at all?
No, as soon as something opens up we'll move right in. Unless it doesn't have a pool, I need a pool.
Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?
Uh-huh!
Take a seat. You okay? You feeling all right?
Yeah, I feel great. 'Cause we're moving in together.
So you uh, you checked the paper for listings in Brooklyn Heights, right? You-you checked the Post?
Yeah, uh-huh, there was nothing. Can I get some water?
In a minute. You-you checked today's Post?
Umm, yeah! Today's.
'Cause uh, this is today's Post and uh, these are the listings I found. Brooklyn Heights, two bedroom. Brooklyn Heights, one bedroom. Brooklyn Heights, Brooklyn Heights, Brooklyn Heights!
Are these for rent! I thought people were just bragging!
Let me tell you what I think might be going on. No-no-no, don't look at the table. Look at me. Okay, I think somebody asked someone to move in with them. And I think someone said, "Yes" but now she's having doubts because things are moving to fast for someone. Does that sound at all possible to you?
Yes. Yes! Fine! I am someone! You want me to say it? I have doubts! I'm sorry!
Phoebe...
Yeah?
Phoebe, it's okay that you feel this way. I mean it is soon. And there's a lot of things we don't know about each other, and I just figure that everything I really like. And the things I don't know, I get to learn about at someplace with both our names on the mailbox.
That's so sweet.
Sweethart, but none of that matters if it's too soon for you. It's fine! We don't have to move in together. I just-I want you to be happy
Living with you would make me happy.
Phoebe, you don't have to say that.
No, I really wanna live with you! I wanna move in with you!
Are you sure?
Yes. Definitely! Yes! Let's live in an apartment that we both live in!
Oh that's great!
Oh wait, one sec. One sec. Hey you! Behind the glass! Who are you looking at! I've always wanted to say that when I was in one of these rooms, which was never!
Show cat! Quality show cat! Show cat!
Oh my God! What's wrong with your baby?!
It's not a baby! It's a cat!
Eew! It's creepy looking!
Oh no! No! It's actually-it's very sweet. It's very sweet. Look! Yeah, do you want it?
No, I hate cats.
Well, so then what are you doing to me? Okay? Just get out of here! All right? Move on!
Wow! What an unusual cat!
Yes! Thank you! Exactly! You want it?
Maybe. I was thinking about getting a cat, I was just going to go to the shelter but... Okay, why not?
Oh, terrific! That'll be $2,000.
What?!
Okay, a thousand.
I thought you wanted to adopt your cat.
Well, I do, but you're just gonna have to actually look at this as more of an investment than a cat.
Okay, yeah, I just wanted a cat.
Obviously you know how to haggle, so I'm not gonna try and take you on. Okay? So $800 and I don't call the cops because you're robbing me blind! Blind! Just take cat, leave the money, and run away! Run away! Damnit! Cat, can't you at least smile or something?! Okay, did anybody just hear that? Anybody?
I'm starving!
Come on guys! Suck it up! We're closing in on ten hours! It's gut-check time!
I don't know who made you the boss? All right? We invented this game!
Please! I made this game what it is.
Not fun anymore?
I'm still hungry!
All right, there's some pizza at my place, we can all eat with one hand right? Are you with me?
I am!
All right! Let's go! Let's go Team Monica! All right, we can work out the name later.
Rachel! What is your cat doing in one of my bowls!
It's not! I'm defrosting a chicken. Oh, I uh sold Mrs. Whiskerson.
Oh, thank God!
Did you get your money back?
Yeah, 15 hundred dollars.
Wow! You made a profit!
I just came for the red-velvet pillow.
Oh yeah, there you go.
Thanks Rachel. And-and don't forget you-you can come visit her anytime you want.
Oh good, great! I'll-I'll keep that in mind.
Hey! So what is this? Some kind of snake or something?
I really like waking up with you.
I like waking up with you too. Oh! It's such a beautiful morning. Oh, I can stay here all day.
That would be great!
We could have breakfast in bed...
Wait, just a second.
Okay. Oh! Oh no.
All right! Come on Monica! Look alive! Come on, look alive!
Oh good, you're all up.
Phoebe! It's 6 o'clock in the morning! Why aren't you at Gary's?
Oh yeah, that's over.
What?!
Come on! Gary's such a great guy! Whatever the problem is, you can work it out!
He shot a bird!
Oh that is over!
That's terrible! I'm sorry!
Phoebe, are you okay?
Yeah. Yeah, I'll be alright.
Oh hey, here Pheebs.
Nah, I don't feel like playing.
It's okay. It's okay. Just pretend that it didn't happen! Okay? No one needs to know! I mean, Phoebe's not an official ballplayer! I mean, only official ballplayers can drop the ball!
All right. Okay. I'm starving!
Phoebe, honey, wanna get some breakfast?
Yeah!
Okay! Okay, let's race! First one there wins! Ha-ha!
You guys wanna eat here?
Yeah! As long as we're here!
Man that was great! Huh? Can you believe how long we threw that ball around?
Yeah, it is amazing it lasted that long.
I know. My arm is killing me.
No, I meant with the dropper over here.
Y'know, how did I get this reputation as a dropper? Okay? I'm anything but a dropper.
What's going on?
Well, my eye is a little itchy.
Uhhh, mine too! Yeah.
Wow! It's really red! You should go see my eye doctor.
Richard? I'm not gonna go see your ex-boyfriend!
Oh, Richard. That's all I ever hear, Richard, Richard, Richard!
Since we've been going out, I think I've mentioned his name twice!
Okay, so Richard, Richard!
It's not Richard! Okay? It's this new guy and he's really good.
Well, I'm sorry I'm not going to an eye doctor!
Oh God, here we go!
What?
Anytime anything comes close to touching her eye or anyone else's she like freaks out. Watch! Watch!
Ross! Come on! That's all right! Fine--Okay, I have a weird thing about my eye. Can we not talk about it please?
All right, fine.
Hey Rach, remember that great song, Me, Myself, and I?
Monica! Come on!
Hey, does anybody want to get some lunch? All those in favor say I?
Ross! Stop it! Come on!
How much did I love The King and I?
Chandler!
Me too! Me too! Me too!
Just stop it! Come on!
You okay there man?
Yeah, I got too excited!
All right, I gotta go. I'm taking Ben to the park.
Ohh, give him a kiss for me!
All right, bye!
Bye!
Bye!
Later!
I am so sorry you got caught in the middle of that. I didn't mean to be so out there. I am furious with him!
Wow umm, calm down.
I'm trying, but man that guy can push my buttons!
Why are so mad at him?
Look, I don't wanna talk about it. Okay?
Well, it just seems that...
You wanna be on my list too? Keep talking! Has anyone seem my list by the way?
Uh, no Pheebs. What's it look like?
Uh, it's a piece of paper and it says, "Ross" on it.
Hey. I just got off the phone with Estelle and guess what. I GOT THE LEAD IN A MOVIE!!!!!!
You got the lead in a movie? That's amazing! What's the movie about?!
It's called Shutter Speed, it's really cool! Yeah, umm, I meet this girl in the subway and we fall in love in like a day, right? And then, she disappears... But I find out where she lives and when I get there this like old lady answers the door and I say, "Where's Betsy?" Right? And she says, "Betsy's been dead for 10 years."
Ohh-oh, chilling!
And the best part is, we're filming in the desert outside Vegas! And you know what that means buddy!
Yeah, I know that means buddy!
Road trip! Yeah, we can rent a car! I just have to be there by Tuesday!
Oh wait, my grandmother's dead.
Well, uh, we can talk about that too Pheebs.
No! No, her cab! She probably won't be using it; you can drive it to Las Vegas.
All right! Thanks Pheebs!
Whoa-whoa-whoa, what are we going to do about my job?
Oh umm, not go.
All right, great, road trip baby! This okay with you?
Chandler! You don't have to ask for my permission. You can go.
Thank you.
Hey Rach, come on! We're gonna be late for the eye doctor appointment!
All right! Let's get this over with! Ugh! Ohhh! No! Look what I did! Oh, I mean, look at this mess! I mean, we're probably gonna have to clean this up! Y'know? We're gonna have to reschedule!
No. If you thought this mess is going to bother me, you are wrong! All right, let's go Blinky! Chandler!!!!
Oh hey Joey! What's up?
I can't decide which route to take to Vegas. Hey, you've traveled a lot right?
Yeah, I've been around.
Okay, so-so which route should I take the northern route or the southern route?
Ooh, if you take the northern route there's a man in Illinois with a beard of bees. {Okay, I must protest this, I've lived in Illinois all my life and know of no man with a beard of bees! Wisconsin, on the other hand, might be a different story.}
Great! Problem solved!
But on the southern route there's a chicken that plays tic-tac-toe.
Well, back to square one.
Oh, I know a way that you can decide! All right, I'm going to ask you a series of questions and you answer as quickly as you can.
Yes!
Good, but wait. Okay, all right, here we go. Now I want you to relax. Take a deep breath. Clear your mind. Which do you like better peanut butter or egg whites?
Peanut butter!
Which would you rather be a fireman or a swimmer?
A swimmer!
Who would you rather sleep with Monica or Rachel?
Monica. Oh... huh, I always thought it would be Rachel.
No thinking! No thinking! Tie or ascot?
Ascot!
North route or south route?
North route!
Bamn! There you go! Huh?
Wow! That was incredible! Beard of bees, here I come!
Hey!
Oh, this guy again.
Hey man, what's up?
Uhh, not much. You guys want to see a movie tonight?
Sure, what do you want to see?
I don't know, umm...
Oh, I know how we can decide. Phoebe, show him your game!
Umm, no thank you.
What's with her?
I don't know. But hey, I know we can decide. Okay, I'm gonna ask you questions and you answer real quick. Okay?
Okay.
What do you like better action or comedy?
Action.
Who would you rather sleep with Monica or Rachel?
Dude, you are sick.
Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot you had that whole Rachel thing.
Oh my God! What does that thing do?
Oh that's an eye removal machine.
All right, I'm outta here!
I'm kidding! I'm kidding!
Hi Rachel!
Hey!
I'm Dr. Miller. Monica told me you were a little nervous, but don't worry everything's gonna be just fine.
So were done then!
Almost! But first, we gotta start.
Okay.
This is a glaucoma test.
Uh-huh.
Sit down.
Okay.
But your chin here. Now, you'll feel a small puff of air in each eye.
What?!
A small puff of air, now come on!
Here we go.
All right.
1...2...3!
I'm sorry. All right, I'll just stay in here this time. Okay.
Ready?
Uh-huh.
1...2...
Y'know what, I'm gonna hold her head.
Okay.
That's okay.
Okay.
Okay. Okay!
1...2! Y'know what? You're young; you probably don't have glaucoma.
Great!! It was very, very nice to meet you sir--Ow! Hey! What are you doing?! Are you crazy!
Okay. You've got a small, minor infection in that left eye. I want you to take these drops three times a day and you'll be as good as new.
Yeah, no, I don't-I don't put things in my eye.
Okay then, I guess we'll see you back here in three months.
Great!
And I'll fit you for a glass eye.
Okay, just give me the damn drops!
Dr. Miller? P E C F D.
Very good Monica! You know where they are.
I sure do! And you don't get one!
Y'know, I-I gotta tell ya, those eye drops are a miracle. My eye is a 100% better.
They're still in my coat.
Damn!
Hey!
Hey! You ready to go?
Yeah, listen, how cold is it going to be there? Do I need a coat or will all these sweater vests be enough?
What?
I love you.
Man, I wish Ross was coming with us! Y'know? I'm gonna miss him!
Thanks a lot! I just got that jerk out of my mind!
Hey, so where are we staying? Is the movie putting us up in a big hotel suite?
Uh no, not really. It's an independent film y'know? So we don't have a real big budget. I figured I'd just stay in your room.
I see, but once you get your first paycheck you'll be springing a big hotel suite, right? I mean, lead in a movie, they must be paying you a lot?
Oh yeah! For every dollar Shutter Speed makes, one penny of it goes right in Joey's pocket.
So you don't get paid unless the movie makes money?
Did you not hear the plot of the movie? "She's been dead for ten years." I'm gonna be a millionaire!
Hey!
Hey!
I just wanna say good-bye to you guys and to see if you guys will place a little bet for me, huh? Twenty bucks on black 15.
You got it!
All right!
All right, bye-bye now!
Bye!
Bye you guys!
Bye-bye!
I wanna say good-bye at the car!
Okay!
Anybody want to say good-bye to me at the car?
Oh honey, I'll say good-bye to you at the car if you don't mind the puss.
See ya!
Well, wait a minute! The puss is good! It means it's healing!
Hey Pheebs, what 'cha reading? Pheebs? Hello? Phoebe? Phoe-Phoebe! Come on!
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't see you there.
Phoebe, are you, are you mad at me, or something? 'Cause if are please, tell me what it is I did!
Well, if you don't know I can't help you.
Well, I don't know.
Well, I can't help you.
Well, whatever it is I'm-I'm very, very sorry. Okay?
Apology accepted.
Okay. So we're, we're good?
Uh-huh.
All right. I'll uh, I'll see you later, okay?
Bye, fat ass.
ALL RIGHT!! Phoebe now come on! Will you please tell me what it is I did that mad you so mad at me!
I don't know! I don't remember!
Well if you can't remember, can't we just forget about this?
Oh no, I am mad at you. I know that much. But, I am sorry about the fat ass thing. You actually have a very sweet little hiney.
Man, I'm getting pretty tired. You're might have to take over soon.
We've been driving for a half-hour, and you haven't looked at the road once.
Don't worry, it's out there! I think I just need lunch.
Yeah.
You wanna eat? My treat!
Isn't that Ross's money?
Yeah. Okay. Ross's treat! Where do you wanna eat?
I don't know.
Ooh, hey, I know how we can decide! All right, uh, I'm gonna ask you a bunch of questions and then you have to answer real fast. Okay? So uh, clear your mind Clear it right out! Clear it out! Clear!
Okay!
Okay, uhh, would you rather be too wet or too dry?
Too dry.
Do you believe in ghosts, yes or no?
No!
Is this movie gonna be my big break?
No!
What?!
Yes.
Dude you said, "No!"
I also said, "Yes!"
You don't think this is going to be a big break for me?
No! Ahhh!!!
I don't believe this!
Look Joe, I just, I just don't want to get your hopes up real high.
What are you talking about?! I'm the lead in a movie!
They're not even paying ya! This doesn't even sound like a real movie!
Y'know what? I don't need this! Okay? I don't know why you're dumping all over my big break.
Joe, I don't think this is going to be your big break.
Is that why you're on this trip, huh? Make me feel like a loser? 'Cause if it is, I'll tell ya, I-I-I'd rather be alone.
Oh, you don't want me on the trip?
Not if you're gonna be like this!
All right, I'll tell ya what, the next time you ask me a question like that I'll lie.
Yeah! I don't want you on the trip!
All right, fine! Fine! Why don't you pull over? I'll get out right now!
Fine! Get out!
You're not actually supposed to stop on the bridge.
Get out!!
All right!! Wait! Wait, there's no sidewalk! Yeah, I'm gonna die here.
Okay, are you mad at me because my hair gel smells?
No.
Are you angry at me because I said your handwriting is childlike?
No that made me feel precious.
Oh, I know! Umm, is it because he's always correcting people's grammar? Whom! Whom! Sometimes it's who!
Yeah? Sometimes it's...
Oh, did you beat him at a board game? He turns into such a baby when he starts to lose.
Okay, I'm the baby.
Eh! Stop it!
Hey!
Chandler! What are you doing here?
Hey!
Joey kicked me out of the car on the George Washington bridge!
Why?!
I don't know! He went crazy! Y'know, we were playing that game where you-you ask a question and you answer it really fast.
That game should not be played without my supervision.
Well, I don't know what mad him so mad, y'know? All I said was that uh, I didn't think this wasn't gonna be his big break, that this movie wasn't going to do anything for him, and that uh, y'know it didn't sound like a real movie--Okay, he should've pushed me off of the bridge.
What's in the bag?
Oh, I figured you guys would all be mad at me. So I got you some gifts that I found on the side of the road. Who wants the teddy bear with one leg?
I do!
Okay.
Not even close.
Okay, then y'know what? Help me! I need help! I can't do this!
Okay! All right! Let's do it!
All right!
Sit down.
All right.
Put your head back.
Yes!
All right.
Okay.
Now, open your eyes.
Okay, they are.
How many fingers am I holding up?
Four.
Oh my God, I was thinking four.
Really?!
Yes! All right, y'know what? Why don't we start with a practice run? Okay?
Okay!
No drops!
Great!
Okay.
Okay.
On three, 1...2...3! Now my pillow's all wet!
Well, well, you said it was practice!
Then why did you move?!
Because I knew you were lying!
All right, come here!
What are you? Monica!! Stop it!! Oh my God! Stop it!
I am going... I'm going--Turn it over! I'm... I am going to get these drops in your eyes.
Oh my God! You really are freakishly strong!
Monica! Stop it!
Damn! It's empty!
Wow, y'know if Joey and Chandler walked in right now, we could make a fortune!
Ooh that is definitely Chandler, Joey, or Ross. Or-or Rachel!
Hello? It's Joey. I'm so glad you called! Chandler told me what happened. Y'know he's really upset about it.
Not as upset as he's gonna be when he finds out what I did with his sweater vests!
What did you do to his sweater vests?
Let's just say there's a well-dressed pack of dogs in Ohio. Hey Monica listen is-is Phoebe there? I gotta ask her something about the car.
Yeah, she's here. Hold on a second.
Hey, dude!
Hey Pheebs! Listen, this wooden box keeps sliding out from under the seat. What-what is it?
Oh that's my grandma. And thanks Joey she's having a really great time.
Is that Joey? Is that Joey? Let me talk to him! I wanna talk to him!
Okay Joey? Chandler's here, he was wondering... Okay, I guess he ran out of change.
Y'know, he won't even talk to me. How am I going to apologize to him if he won't even talk to me?
Well, maybe you should send him something. So that when he gets to Las Vegas he'll know that you're sorry.
That's a good idea. I wonder where I could get a basket of porn...
No, don't-don't say I'm sorry with porn!
Really?
Y'know what you should send him? A cartoon of cigarettes. 'Cause that why he could trade it for protection. No. That's prison.
Okay Pheebs, I know how we're going to figure this out. Okay, clear your mind and answer the first thing that comes into your head. Okay?
Uh-hmm.
What do you like better flora or fauna?
Fauna.
Who would you rather be Simon or Garfunkle?
Garfunkle.
Why are you mad at me?
You said I was boring--Ohh!
When did I say you were boring?!
Oh my God, I remember now! We were playing chess!
Phoebe! You and I have never played chess!
Oh, come on! Yes, remember that time on the frozen lake? We were playing chess, you said I was boring, and then you took off your energy mask and you were Cameron Diaz! Okay, there's a chance this may have been a dream.
Hey-hey! Stanley! Hey-hey! You're leading man is here! Let's get to work.
Umm, slight change of plans. We've shut down.
Wh-what?! Why?!
It's a money thing, we don't have any.
You're kidding right?
No.
What?!
It-it's probably just temporary. We're hoping to get some more money soon, so if could just uh, hang out.
Uh, hang out?! How long?
I don't know. A week? Maybe two? The money will turn up! People will always wanna invest in movies! Hey, you're not rich are ya?
No!
Eh, worth a shot. Look Joey, let me know where you're staying, okay?
Hey pal, are you Joey Tribbiani?
Yeah.
These got left for ya.
Thanks. Congratulations on your big break.
Hello?
Hey Monica, it's Joey!
Hey Joey! Aww, you remembered even though you're a big star!
Aw, come on! It'll be years before I forget you!
Joey, what's it like on a movie set, huh? Do you have a dressing room? Do you have a chair with your name on it?
Uh, well yeah-yeah, I've got all of that going on. Yeah, listen uh, I want you to make sure you tell Chandler that he couldn't have been more wrong! Uh-oh! I gotta go Monica, my uh, my sushi's here!
Sorry about that. Thanks for waitin'.
Okay!
Everybody smile! Okay, thanks a lot! Enjoy your stay at Caesar's! We hope it's toga-rrific! Kill me. Kill me now.
Hey Rach, can you pass me the TV Guide?
Yep!
Go!!
What?!! Stop it! Stop it! Oh my God!
Okay! Okay! Okay! We'll see you in about 3 to 4 hours.
Oh!
Pheebs? Could you get that? Please?
Why? Just 'cause you're too lazy to get up off your touchie?
No! No! It's just that all the people in the entire world that I want to talk to are right here.
Okay!
Sucker!
Hello? Hey Joey!
Hey Pheebs! Listen, uh can you do me a favor? I forgot the pin number to my ATM card can, can you get it for me?
Sure! Where is it?
Uh, I scratched it on the ATM machine down on the corner.
Ohh! So you're 5639?!
That's it! Thanks Pheebs!
Hey!
Ooh, do you want to talk to Chandler?
Is that Joey?! Let me talk to him!
No! Because he didn't believe in my movie! Which is a big mistake because it is real! Real!
Hey! Tribbiani! Get back to work! Break time's over!
Who was that?
Uhh, my stunt double. Yeah, and y'know, he's getting a little too familiar for my tastes.
Y'know what? I have been trying to apologize to him all week! If he's not gonna let me do it on the phone, I'm gonna go down there and do it in person.
Uhh Pheebs, I heard that. Can you put him on?
Yeah!
Hey!
Don't come out here!
No-no-no-no, I've supported you one hundred percent and I want to prove that to you in person!
I got that! I forgive ya! Don't come out here!
Forgive me? You haven't been taking my calls in a week!
Well, I'm totally over it Chandler. Friends forever! Don't come out here!
Would you mind doing a picture with us?
Uh, what was that?
Uh, Entertainment Tonight. Yeah, okay so, good talking to ya and don't come out here. All right.
Monica! I'm sorry I'm late! Monica?
Phoebe? Oh, Phoebe, I'm so sorry. Have you been here long?
It's okay. What the hell took you so long?
Okay, you can not tell Chandler. Okay? That I ran into Richard.
Which Richard?
The Richard.
Richard Simmons?! Oh my God!
Noo! My ex-boyfriend Richard! Y'know the tall guy, moustache?
Oh! Okay, that actually makes more sense. So how was it?
It was, it was really nice. We started talking and I-I ended up having lunch with him.
That is so weird! I had a dream that you'd have lunch with Richard.
Really?
But again, Simmons. Go on.
The strange part was, he was really nice, umm and he looks great, but I didn't feel anything at all!
Ooh! So now why can't we tell Chandler?
Because it would totally freak him out and tomorrow's our anniversary. I just don't want anything to spoil that.
Oh, I can't believe you guys lasted a whole year!
I know.
Wow! I owe Rachel 20 bucks!
What?
On a totally different bet.
Hey!
It's almost our anniversary!
I know. Can you believe it? One year ago today I was just your annoying friend Chandler.
Awww! Now you're just my annoying friend Chandler.
Huh.
I got you a present!
Oh, but it's not 'til tomorrow!
I know, but you have to open it today!
Okay.
Okay! There you go! It's two tickets to Vegas!
Wow!
For this weekend! Oh gosh, it would be perfect, we get to see Joey plus we get to start our anniversary celebration on the plane. We can call it out plane-aversary.
Do we have to?
No.
Okay this is great, but Joey said he didn't want any of us out there.
Oh, he just doesn't want us to go through any trouble. Think of how excited he'll be when we go out and surprise him! Plus we get to have our own, ani-Vegas-ary! A-Nevadaversary!
Yeah, I think we should see other people.
But we can go, right?
Yes.
Okay!
It's a great idea.
Okay, I'm gonna go too!
Y'know Pheebs, it's kinda our anniversary.
Oh please, you are not gonna ditch again like you did with London.
Ditch you? Phoebe, you were pregnant with the triplets!
Uh-huh, great story! I'm going!
Hi!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey, you guys, listen, this weekend we're all gonna go to Las Vegas to surprise Joey! Including me!! You wanna go?!
Well, I guess I could take a couple days off work.
Of course you can take a couple days off work because this trip includes me!
Oh no, wait a minute, wait, I've got a presentation tomorrow. I can't miss that.
Oh, but I've got tickets to the Van Gogh exhibit! I've been waiting like a year for this.
Art lover!
What'd you say?
I said art lover.
Is that supposed to be an insult?
I don't know, I'm very tired.
So Rach, maybe you and I could fly out together Saturday.
That sounds great.
Yeah? All right I'll call the airlines.
Okay. Yeah, that would be nice actually, to have the apartment to myself for a night.
Oh yeah, so you can walk around naked.
No! So I can be by myself. Y'know? Have a little alone time.
Naked alone time.
No! Phoebe just because I'm alone doesn't mean I wanna walk around naked. I mean, you live alone, you don't walk around naked.
Uh-huh! Why do you think it takes me so long to answer the door?
So, so far is this trip to Vegas better or worse than the trip to London?
So it's pretty much the same Pheebs.
Okay, what about after I give you these candies?
Yeah, I guess it's a little better now.
Ah-ha! Okay, Las Vegas 1, London 0! I'll be right back.
Happy plane-aversary.
Aww! I love you!
Can I give you a present now?
Okay!
Okay! Oh man! Don't tell me I did this!
I love the "I forgot the present" fake out!
How do you feel about the, "I really did forgot the present, please forgive me" not fake out?
Oh that's okay. Don't worry about it, you can give it to me when we get back.
Ohh that's the worse thing that can happen on an anniversary ever!
Oh good! All right, so you decided to tell him about the Richard thing.
What-what Richard thing?
Oh no.
What Richard thing?
Simmons! Go with Simmons!
Okay, I umm, I ran into Richard yesterday and he asked me if I wanted to go for a bite and I did. The only reason I didn't tell you is because I knew you'd get mad and I didn't want to spoil our anniversary.
I'm not mad.
Really?!
Oh yeah! Yeah, so you-you bumped into Richard! You grabbed a bite! It's no big deal.
Great!
Okay, London 1...
Oh! Look what happened! {Don't get your hopes up guys, we only get to see her from the back or from the neck up. Its times like these I wish that the networks would broadcast some nudity other than Denis Franz's butt.} Huh, check me out! I'm in my kitchen...naked! I'm picking up an orange. I'm naked! Lighting the candles, naked, and carefully.
Oh my God! That's Rachel naked! I can't look at that! I am looking at this. Okay, vivid colors, expressive brush strokes-Unless she wants me to be looking at that. She knows I'm home. She knows I can see her. What kind of game is she playing? I think maybe someone's lonely tonight. Oh-ho, Dr. Geller! Stop it! You're being silly! Or, am I?
Love to love ya baby! Ow! Love to love ya baby! Ow! Love to love ya, baby! Darnit! Ugh.
Hey.
May I come in?
Uh, yeah, if you want too.
Do you want me too?
Yeah, sure?
So do I. Okay Rach, before anything happens I just want to lay down a couple of ground rules. This is just about tonight. I don't to go through with this if it's going to raise the question of "Us." Okay? I just want this to be about what it is!
And um, what-what is that Ross?
The physical act of love.
What?! Are you crazy?
Oh so-so you weren't trying to entice me just now with your-your nakedness?
Oh God, you saw me?! Oh!
You weren't trying to entice me with your nakedness.
Noo!! No! You thought, you actually thought I wanted to have sex with you?!
No! No! No! No-no-no-no.
Ohh wow! I'm sorry, but Ross you kicked off your shoes!
Can we, can we just forget this ever happened?
Yes of course, absolutely! You're right. I'm sorry.
Thank you.
Yes.
All right I guess I'm, gonna go pack.
Okay. Oh wait! One more thing umm, do-do we still need to uh settle the question of "us?"
Hey you guys wait! Guys! This place is so much better than London! Okay? This lady dressed like Cleopatra gave me a coupon, 99 cent steak and lobster dinner. Huh!
Phoebe, you don't eat animals.
For 99 cents, I'd eat you. Okay, I can totally settle down here. It's got everything I could ever want, including Joey! Look! Oh! Look! Hi!
Oh my God.
Hey! Joey! Hey! Hey!! Wow!
Hi!
Love your condoms my man.
What-what are you guys doing here? I thought I told you not to come.
Why are you dressed as a gladiator?
Uhh, because I'm shooting a scene right now. Yeah, I uh, I play a gladiator. Uh, y'know what? Hold-hold on a second. Can we cut? Yeah, my-my friends are here, I'm gonna take a little break.
Who are you talking too?
They uh director. Uhh, her. All right, all right, it's not a gladiator movie. I work here.
Why?! What happened?!
Well, the movie got shutdown because they ran out of money, so I'm working here 'til it starts up again, if it ever does.
I'm so sorry.
Look, I'm sorry I didn't tell ya. I'm sorry man.
No-no, that's okay, apparently there's a new policy where we don't have to share everything with everybody.
I knew you were not okay with that.
So you're a gladiator! Wow!
Yeah, what-what's going on?
Monica had lunch with Richard.
Dawson?!
Noo! But that would've been so cool!
No! Her boyfriend Richard!
It meant nothing! Okay? After all this time, how can you not trust me?
When you go lunching with hunky moustache men and don't tell me about it!
You're right. I'm sorry. I should've told you.
Thanks.
Aww, there we go.
I love Vegas!
I promise you, next time I will absolutely tell you.
Next time?
Ooh, so close.
There's not gonna be a next time! You can not ever see him again!
I can not see him? I mean, you can't tell me what to do!
That's so funny, because I think I just did!
Oh y'know what? If you're gonna be acting like this all night, I really, I don't even want to be around you.
Fine with me!
Fine! Happy Anniversary!
Whoa! Whoa! Guys! Please! Come on! Come on! This is obviously just a big misunderstanding.
No it is not!
What are you talking...
Hey-hey don't look at me! I just work here!
Okay umm, Ross? I'm-I'm really warm, so I'm going to be taking off my sweater. Now, I'm just letting you know that this is not an invitation to the physical act of love.
Yep! That's hilarious!
I'm sorry. I'm done. I'm done.
Y'know, last night was embarrassing for you too.
No, not really. I mean you've seen me naked hundreds of times.
Uh-huh. But it was a first for the rest of my building.
Okay. All right, that's true! But y'know I just don't embarrass that easily.
What?! You totally get embarrassed!
No, I don't! Ross, I think I'm just a more secure person than you are.
Is that so?
Yeah.
Hey lady! I don't care how much you want it! Okay?! I am not gonna to have sex with you in the bathroom!
Hey, y'know in Roman times this was more than just a hat.
Really?
Yeah, sure! Sure! They would uh, they would scrub the floors with it! They would use it to get the mud off their shoe. And sometimes underneath the horse would get dirty so they would stick it right...
Joey, I uh! I can't believe this is how I'm spending my anniversary.
All right well, I'll take you someplace nice then. Look! A guy tipped me a hundred bucks today.
Whoa!
Yeah-yeah, he was playing blackjack for like an hour and he won $5,000. Can you believe that? $5,000!
Y'know, if I won $5,000 I'd join a gym, y'know build up my upper body and hit Richard from behind with a stick!
Wait a minute! Why don't I do what that guy did? I'll take this $100 and turn it into $5,000! And then I'll turn that into enough money to get my movie going again!
Good luck!
Chandler! I don't need luck. I have thought this through!
I see.
Thank you.
Thanks.
I can't believe this! This is like the worst night ever!
Y'know Monica you had a minor setback in your relationship with Chandler. Big deal! It's only Chandler. I am so sorry.
This is crazy! I mean, it's such a stupid argument. I don't even wanna see Richard again.
So go fix it! Go find Chandler! He's probably up in your room! Tell him that you're sorry and that you love him.
Y'know what? You're right Phoebe. You're right. Thank you!
Sure! Yeah! Las Vegas, number one!
Anybody lose this?
Comin' out. Place your bet. Dice are out. Double or nothin'! Pay the front line!
Hmm.
So uh, I'm on my way back to the bathroom.
Yeah, all right. All right! Just keep walkin'! All right?
Ross! What are you... I'm sorry sir. I just, I think he just really likes you.
Hey! Y'know that teacher who had a baby with her student?
What the? What...
Hi!
Miss? May I help you?
Yes, I'm sorry. Do you have any extra pants? Umm, my friend seems to have had a little accident.
Can I change a hundred?
Changing one hundred! Good luck sir.
Let's ride.
13.
Hit me! Ohh man! Wait!
Chandler! You are not gonna believe this! I have found my identical hand twin!
What?
My identical hand twin!
What's an identical hand twin?
What's it sound like? It's a guy with my identical hands! It was incredible! Chandler, the dealer's hands were exactly like me! It-it was like looking at my hands in a mirror!
Are you sure you weren't looking at your hands in a mirror?
Don't you see what this means?! I can forget about that stupid movie. I'm gonna be a millionaire!
How?
Look, I don't have it all worked out yet, but it's gotta mean big money! Come on! Identical hands!
Again I must go back to, how?
This is Vegas man! People will pay to see freaky stuff! Okay, how much would you pay to see this hand twice? Huh?
Y'know, I-I can't really put a price on that Joe.
Hey, are you unsupporting me again?
No! No! I support you 100%! I just didn't, I didn't get it right away. Y'know now I'm caught up! Identical hand twins! It's a million-dollar idea!
Hey!
Pheebs!!
Yeah?
I found my identical hand twin!
Ohh, you are so lucky! Hey! So, where's Monica? Did you guys make up?
No!
But she just came up here!
That was Joey!
I wonder where she is. That is so weird.
Yeah, well, she's probably talking to Richard.
Would you stop that! Do you wanna know the first thing she said when she came back from her lunch with Richard? She didn't feel anything for him. She loves you!
Really?
Yes! Now, she feels terrible! She really wants to make up! You gotta find her.
Okay.
Good. I should really start wearing hats!
Welcome to Las Vegas.
Thank you! Enjoy your flight?
Yes, I did. Thank you very much, it was excellent.
Hope you had a nice flight.
Ohh, it was the best!
I think the check in is that way.
Ahh.
Hello! Ohh, kids love me.
Hey!
Phoebe!
You guys are here! Yay!
Hi!
What? Did you go to a costume party? Let me guess umm Pancho Vila? and you're Bob Saget.
Pancho Vila?
Yeah!
What are you talking about Pheebs? I don't... Oh my God, you drew on me?!
Hey, you wet my pants!
Whoa, what kind of party was this?
Ross, I have been walking around like this since the plane! I can-you have so crossed a line.
Rach! Wait! The men's room is that way.
Ugh!
What?
That's like the third time that lady's won on a machine I was playing.
Oooohhh, I'll bet she's one of those people.
M-M-Mole people?
What? No-no, a lurker.
Oh. What's a lurker?
Okay when you're playing a machine and it hasn't paid out, a lurker waits for you to give up and then...
Kills you?
No. They swoop in and steal your jackpot.
Ohhh!
Uh-hmm.
How do you know about this?
My nana used to do it. That's how she paid for all my dance-karate lessons.
Dance karate?
Yes, it's a deadly but beautiful sport.
All right, it won't come off!
What?!
It won't come off!
Oh my God! Rach-Rach, are-are-are you sure?
No, actually I took it off then I drew it back on.
Hey-hey-hey you made it!
Joey!!
All right! Hey-hey!
Hi!!
Who's your friend? He's hot!
Thanks man.
Hi.
Hey listen I uh, talked to Chandler, sorry about the movie.
No, don't be sorry. I don't need it anymore. I found my identical hand twin!
Your what?
My identical hand twin! The person whose hands are exactly like mine! This thing is a gold mine!
What?! That's not gonna make you any money!
Okay. Well, if that's how you feel about it, fine! None of you get to live with me in my great big hand-shaped mansion! Except uh, you Pheebs. You can live in the thumb.
All right baby, come on! Yes! Yes! I am on fire!
See you later Mon.
Wait Chandler, what are you doing?!
What does it look like? I'm going home.
What? Wait! Why? Chandler! Chandler! Wait! I'm sorry, I was just playing for one second! I was trying to find you to tell you that, look if you don't want me to see Richard again, I won't! He means nothing to me!
Come on! I was there! I know he's the love of your life.
Not any more.
Really?!
Really! All right? Let's forget about this going home stuff and celebrate our anniversary. Okay, this is empty.
Yeah, I wanted to make a dramatic scene, but I hate packing.
Uhh, hey. Where's the other guy?
Which guy?
He's kinda tall, dark hair, hand looks exactly like this. See?
I don't know about the hands, but the guy that was here before me just went to the bathroom.
Okay! How you doin'?
Very busy.
Right! Okay.
Yes, hello. I have a question. Umm, I used your pen to draw on my friend's face. A beard and a moustache. Thank you. No, she didn't think so. I know it's like anyway, umm well make-up didn't cover it and we've tried everything to get it off and nothing's worked. What-what do we do? Yeah. Uh-huh. Yeah. Oh! Okay. Okay, thank you! Yeah, it's not coming off.
What?! What else did he say?
Umm, he said he thought I was funny. So... Okay, look-look umm, let's just go downstairs, we'll have some fun, and you will forget all about it.
Ross, no! There is no way I am leaving this room looking like this!
Oh, come on! Rach, it's-it's not that bad.
Ross, I am a human doodle!!
Look, just because some idiot drew on your face doesn't mean you shouldn't have any fun! Okay? And besides, hey-hey-hey no one is even gonna look at you. Okay? This is Vegas! Hello! There are tons of other freaks here! There are tons...of...freaks here. No other. No. Come on! No one will notice, I swear!
Okay, there was some staring and pointing.
Okay, I need a, I need a drink!
Oh, hey y'know, they-they really overcharge you for that stuff. But who cares?! Because it's all on me! That is, one big drink!
Macadamia nut?
Umm... Wow! That's-that's some pricey nut!
Hm-mmm!
Really like those Macadamia nuts, huh?
Nope!
Get out of here you lurker! Go on! Get!
Hey Pheebs!
Ohh! You made up!
Yeah, I couldn't be mad at him for too long.
Yeah, she couldn't live without the Chan Love.
Ohh, get a room.
We have one.
I know. Use it.
Oh-oh-oh, yeah! That's right, you take good care of those babies!
Excuse me?
It's me, Joey!
Do I know you?
Joey!
Oh-ho, yeah. Yeah, the hand guy.
Okay, so what are we going to do about this hand twin thing?!
Nothing?
Look, you and I have been given a gift. Okay? We have to do something with it. Like-like, hand modeling! Huh? Or-or magic! And you know NASA's gonna wanna talk to us!
I have to get back to...
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa-whoa! We could have our own show! Y'know we could clap our hands together people will love it! Huh? And-and-and I wrote a song for us! This hand is your hand! This hand is my hand! Oh wait, that's your hand! No wait, it's my hand!
That's okay.
But you haven't even heard the chorus!
Oh my God, I'm starting to look like my great aunt, Muriel.
All right. Y'know what? We don't have to go downstairs! We can bring Vegas up to us! All right, come on, come on, we'll play some blackjack. Here we go. 13.
Hit me!
Oohh, 23. Which is what we play to at this casino! You win 10 dollars!

What did you just say?
You roll another hard eight and we get married here tonight.
Are you serious?!
Yes! I love you! I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.
I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.
Okay, so if an eight comes up, we take it as a sign and we do it! {Whoa! Where have I heard that before? Matthew Perry talking about signs in Las Vegas. I guess it must've been some movie I saw.} What do you say?
Okay!
Okay! Come on! Let's go! All right!
Okay! That's a four! And where-where's the other one?
It went under the table.
Nobody move! Okay, you look that way; I'll look this way!

It's a four.
I think so too.

You can't sit here if you're not gonna play.
Ooh-ho-ho!
Hello. My name is Regina Phalange. I'm a businesswoman in town on business. Would you like to see my card? Ooh, what did I do with my file-a-facts? I must've left it in conference room B.
14.
Hit me!
Oh my God! May I just say that you two gentlemen have the exact same hands! They're identical! Now, I've never seen anything like that in the business world.
Stop it!
Uhh, Ms. Phalange, may I ask you a question as an impartial person at-at this table?
Please stop it!
Wouldn't you pay good money to see these identical hands showcased in some type of a uh, entertainment venue?
If you leave now, I will chop off my hand and give it too you!
Didn't I just throw you out of here?
No, you threw out Phoebe. I'm Ms. Regina Phalange. Phalange!

All right.
Dum! Dum-dum-dum! Dum! Dum! Dum! Dum-dum-dum!
What are you doing?
Oh, that's The Wedding March. Does, does that freak you out?
No, only because that's the graduation song.
