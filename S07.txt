Hey, what's going on?
Hey.
I found a note on my door, "Come to Monica's quick, bring champagne and a Three Musketeers bar."
Yeah I'll take that.
What's up?
Monica and I are engaged.
Oh my God. Congratulations.
Thanks.
Where is she?
I'm engaged!!!!!! I'm engaged!!!!
Yeah, she's been out there for twenty minutes, I'm surprised you didn't hear her on the way over.
Oh, I thought it was just a kid yelling, "I'm gay! I'm gay!" Can I bring her in?
Oh no, let her stay out there. It's sweet.
I'm getting married!!!! I'm gonna be a bride!!!! No, I will not shut up because I'm engaged! Ohh, big talk! Huh, why don't you come over here and say that to me?! Huh, buddy?! Yeah, my fiancee will kick your ass! Come on, apartment 20! Apartment 20!
Okay, you get her in here. You bolt the door. I'll be in the closet.
Okay! Wait-wait-wait! Shhh! Okay, umm, I just wanna say that...I love you guys so-so much and-and thank you for being here on my special night. Our special night. I mean it just wouldn't be my-our-our night, if you all weren't here to celebrate with me-us-Damnit!
It's okay, I want this to be your night too. To Monica.
Awww, come on-wait-stop it. Okay, to Monica.
To Monica!
So have you decided on a band for the wedding? Because, y'know, I'm kinda musical.
Yeah Pheebs, honey, she just got engaged a couple of hours ago. I doubt she's even had time to...
Well speaking of chiming in, remember the time you burned down my apartment?
Yeah, you're on your own.
Y'know what we should do? We should all get dressed up and go to have champagne at The Plaza.
But I-I-I can't stay too long, I gotta get up early for a commercial audition tomorrow and I gotta look good. I'm supposed to be playing a 19-year-old. What?
So when you said, "Get up early," did you mean 1986?
You guys don't think I look 19?
Oh, 19! We thought you said 90!
Okay everybody, let's go! Let's go!
Okay.
Okay.
Hey, is uh the rest of my candy bar around here?
Oh honey no, you ate it all.
I was afraid of that.
Y'know what shoes would look great with this ring? Diamond shoes! You're not getting dressed.
Know what I mean?
Yeah, but I don't think we have time.
There's gonna be a wedding. You're gonna be the bride. Two hundred people are going to be looking at you in a clean white dress.
Let's do it!
Chandler! It happens to lots of guys! You-you-you were probably tired, you had a lot of champagne, don't worry about it!
I'm not worried, I'm uh, I'm fascinated. Y'know it's like uh, Biology! Which is funny because in high school I uh, I-I failed Biology and tonight Biology failed me.
Check it out. Okay, I can play this when the guests are coming in. Okay. "First Time I Met Chandler, I Thought He Was Gay. But here I am singing on his wedding day!"
Phoebe!
If you would've let me finish, it goes on to say that he's probably not gay.
Sure, you guys don't have this problem, you're made of wood. Hey!
Hey!
You look great!
Oh, thanks.
You okay over there?
I don't know, y'know? I feel a little umm... No, y'know what? Nevermind, I'm gonna be fine.
Oh, don't worry about it I mean you probably were tired, you had a lot of champagne, it happens to everybody.
Hey!
Hi!
Wow! Happy Monica's night!
Well thank you, you too.
Thanks.
Hey, do you believe this? Do you believe they are actually getting married?
Well sure. But I get married all the time so...
Ohh...
You okay?
Yeah, I guess. I-I... I mean, do-do you think we're ever gonna have that?
You mean, we-you and me?
Oh no-no-no-no-no, no, no! We, you with someone and me with someone.
Oh good, you scared me for a minute.
Shake it off.
I mean-no, it's just 'cause, it's just 'cause you and I were like a nightmare. No, but there was some good times.
No, absolutely. Y'know like it was umm...
Surely you can think of something good.
Yeah, just give me a minute! Oh well, yes, I can think of one good thing.
What?
Well you uh, you were always really good at the uh, at the uh the stuff.
Yeah? I was good at the stuff huh?
Uh-hmm, uh-hmm, yeah, yeah, I really liked your hands.
My hands?
Yeah.
Yeah?
Uh-huh.
Way to go guys. Y'know, you-you were really good at the stuff too.
Oh, I know. Hey, y'know what we never did? Oh no, not that. We uh, we never had bonus night!
A what?
Y'know, bonus night. Y'know, when two people break up but they get back together for just one night.
One night, just-just sex. No strings attached?
Yeah-yeah, we never had that,
No.
Okay, this is getting a little crazy. I mean, I'm-I'm sure it would be amazing but I...gotta say I really-really don't think it would be a good idea. Y'know? I really, really...don't.
'Sup? 'Sup dude?
Take whatever you want, just please don't hurt me.
So you're playing a little Playstation, huh? That's whack! Playstation is whack! 'Sup with the whack Playstation, 'sup?! Huh? Come on, am I 19 or what?!
Yes, on a scale from 1 to 10, 10 being the dumbest a person can look, you are definitely 19.
Come on man, really how old?!
Young! You're a man-child okay?! Now go get changed because everybody's ready and please, oh please, keep my underwear!
Wow thanks!
Joe?
Yeah!
Uhh, you've had a lot of sex right?
When? Today? Some, not a lot.
Well, it's just the reason that I'm asking is because I kind of eh, uh, I was unable to-I mean I really wanted too, but I couldn't.... There huh-hmm, there-there was an incident.
Don't worry about that man, that happens.
It's happened to you?
Yeah! Once.
Well, what'd you do?
I did it anyway.
Phoebe! Come on! Let's go! Come on! Why aren't you dressed yet?!
I'm sorry, but I just wrote the best dance song for your wedding. Check this out.
No, Phoebe, I'll tell you what, if you get ready now I'll let you play it at the wedding.
Really?! Oh that's so exciting! Thank you! Thanks Mon! Oh but Mon, if you touch my guitar again I'll have to pound on you for a little bit.
Fair enough, now go get ready!
Okay.
I'll get everybody else , finally we can start celebrating my- I'm sorry, uh apparently I've opened the door to the past.
Okay, Monica. Mon, uh what-what you just saw...
Can I ask you just a little question, huh? Why tonight?
What?
See, I've been waiting my whole life to be engaged, and unlike some people I'm only planning on doing this once. So, uh y'know, maybe this is selfish and I'm sorry about it, but I was kinda hoping tonight could just be about that.
Oh honey, but it is just about...
It is! It is!
No it's not! No! No! Now it's about you and Ross getting back together!
What?!
See yeah umm, you kinda stole my thunder!
Okay! Ho-ho! We did not steal your thunder because we are not getting back together!
Yeah. No. And you know what? Nobody even saw!
Yeah!
That's true.
Honey I swear it we just kissed.
It was just a kiss.
You guys kissed!!!!! What does this mean?!! Are you, are you getting back together?! Can I sing at your wedding?
Thunder being stolen!!
Okay come on Phoebe, it's nothing! Monica, come on!
Look let's not make a big deal out of this! It was a one time thing. It doesn't even matter!
Oh my God! I cannot believe you guys are talking about this! The problems in the bedroom are between the man and the woman!!! All right?!! Now Chandler is doing the best he can!!
I don't think that's what they were talking about Joe!!
What a great night, Chandler can't do it, these guys kissed...
What?
What?!
You guys kissed! Oh my-this is huge!
No!
Oh no!
No-no, it's really not huge.
And; people thinking it's huge has led Monica to believe that we are stealing her thunder. Which we are not!
Well, we're still talking about it, aren't we?
Well yeah, that and Chandler's problem.
Monica-Monica-Monica-Monica, listen-listen, listen, listen, would-would it make you feel better if we all stop talking about Ross and Rachel.
Yes that would be lovely.
You got it. Okay. Now, I can pass for 19 right?!
Yes, you can pass for 19.
Really?
Yes!
Seriously?
Seriously? Seriously, no! You can play your own age which is 31!
I'm 30!
Joey, you are not! You're 31.
Aww crap!
Okay, so The Plaza! Okay, we'll get us some Mai Thai's, maybe no more for you though.
Y'know what? I-I think that umm, I don't feel like going to The Plaza.
Why?!
Honey, Monica, this is ridiculous! Look...
No-no, I-I really don't want to talk about it! I don't! Especially with you.
Psss, that is whack!
Yeah? Okay, I think I'll play it at the wedding.
Yeah! Well, I think we'll see if they actually let you play. Huh? I mean they tell you anything you want to hear like-like, "You look 19," and then they just take it away like-like, "No you don't."
Well, I don't think Monica is gonna take this away.
Wouldn't she?
Would she?
Would she? You ate my candy bar!
Guess who?
Hey.
Hey, I just realized we kinda let some stuff up in the air...
What do you think Monica mean when she said she didn't want to talk, especially with me? I mean, why not especially you and me? We were both out there kissing.
Still thinking about it huh?
Come on! Serious-ser-ser-seriously, what did she mean by that? Especially you!
Oh, who cares?
I care!
And so do I.
Y'know what, I-I have to go talk to her, would you let me just get changed?
Okay. Sure.
Am I going to let you watch me undress?
No!
I can't believe her, y'know it's just-it's so typical.
Now Monica, I know you're upset, but don't forget. There is going to be a wedding, you are going to throw the bouquet, and then there's going to be a honeymoon, maybe in Paris.
Paris?
We will take a moonlit walk on the Rue de la .
Keep talking.
Then we will sprinkle rose pedals on the bed and make love. Not just because it's romantic, but because I can!
I love you!
Bonjour, monsieur.
Okay, don't say anything, you might scare it away.
It's Paris, who knows we're here!
Hi Pheebs, what's up?
Okay, you said I could sing at your wedding so, I'm just gonna need a small deposit.
What?!
Y'know, just some good faith money to hold the date.
Pheebs, we're not giving you a deposit for our wedding!
Oh, I see.
They break your heart, don't they?
Y'know, I don't really their permission.
Yeah! If you wanna sing at their wedding, well you sing at their wedding!
Yeah! And if you wanna look 19, then you... You gotta do something about your eyes.
What?! What's wrong with my eyes.
They give you away! There's just-there's just too much wisdom in there. Just put some tea bags on there for like 15 minutes.
And that'll get rid of my wisdom?
Maybe just 10 minutes for you.
Oh, give her the deposit! Give her the ring! I don't care!
Yes.
Monica, what did you mean before when you said you didn't want to talk to anyone, especially me?
What a great apology! And you accept! Okay, bye-bye!
No-no, seriously-seriously, what was the especially me part about?
Well, let's just say it's not the first time you've stolen my thunder.
What?!
Hey, here's a thought.
Monica, what are you talking about?
My Sweet Sixteen! Remember, you went to third base with my cousin Charlie.
Ahh, third base.
It's all everybody at the party could talk about!
Monica, y'know what? The only reason I did that was because your party was so boring!
We had a characturist!
Oh!!
"Whenever I get married, guess who won't get to sing? Somebody named Geller! And somebody else named Bing!"
Monica, your Sweet Sixteen was like a million years ago.
And yet, here we are doing it again.
Ugh, Monica I don't want to steal your stupid thunder!
Oh please! Why else would you have made out with Ross?!
Got me.
All right, easy mimey, the moment has passed, it ain't gonna happen!
I just thought it would be nice if I could have just this one night!
I swear, I never wanted any part of your night!
Oh, is that why you did it the secret hallway where nobody ever goes?!
Uh, Rachel, I've been thinking. I don't think us getting together tonight is such a good idea. I'm calling it off.
Why to save your dignity my man.
Monica, why? Why would I ever want to take away from your night?
I don't know! I don't-maybe you're feeling a little resentful. Maybe ah, maybe you thought you'd get married first! Maybe you can't stand the fact that your formally fat friend is getting married before you!
Oh wow. That-y'know what? That is so unfair. Y'know what? Now I want to steal your thunder! Come on Ross, let's go have sex!
I can't believe you're gonna have sex on my engagement night!!
Well, somebody should.
Look uh, if we're gonna do this...
We're not gonna do this, all right? She's just gonna think that we're doin' it.
Oh, I see, so everybody wins.
Who is it?
It's Monica, open up!
Okay well Ross! Stop it please! Wait a minute!
Oww!
Yeah, you like that baby? May we help you?
I just wanted to say that I hope you do have sex tonight and I hope that you guys get back together, but I must warn you, the night that you announce your engagement I'm going to announce that I'm pregnant!
How is that ever going to happen?!
All right Monica, do you want to know why I was with Ross tonight?!
I know why!
No you don't know why!
Okay! Why?!
Because! Because I was sad.
What do you mean?
Look, I am so...so happy for you guys, but you getting married just reminds me of the fact that I'm not. I'm not even close. And I don't know, maybe I just wanted to make myself feel better. And I know that that's dumb, but oh my God you were so depressed when Ross got married that you slept with Chandler!
I don't care, she slept with me.
Anyway sweetie, I am, I'm so sorry I ruined your night.
I'm sorry I almost made you sleep with Ross.
Well, I'm going to take off. Congratulations man.
Thanks.
And uh, Rachel.
Yeah.
What can I say, you missed your chance. From now on the only person who's going to enjoy these bad boys is me.
"We thought Phoebe would leave, but she just stayed and stayed. That's right, I'm here all night, and Chandler will never get l..."
Hey! Here's a dollar, consider it a deposit. Please sing at our wedding.
Oh thank you.
Okay.
Now... "Who will perform the ceremony! Who will perform the cer--Oh-oh! All right, I'll pound on him in the morning.
Hey!
Hi!
Who wants French toast?
Oh, I'll have some!
Good, me too. Eggs and milk are in the fridge. Thanks.
Oww!
What's the matter honey?
I don't know, my hand feels weird. I guess it's because, I'm engaged! How long before it starts getting annoying?
It starts?
Yeah, so let's get started on the wedding plans!
Okay!
Already?!
Yeah, we got a lot to do! We gotta think about the flowers, the caterers, the music...
Oh, I got some thoughts on that.
Oh wait Chandler, too many cooks...
Take from me, as the groom all you have to do is show up and try to say the right name.
Okay!
What in God's name is that?!
Oh my God, the wedding book?! I haven't seen that since the forth grade!
This baby has got everything. Take y'know, locations for instance. First, organized alphabetically, then geographically, then by square footage.
That is so smart! Break it off. Break it off now.
And that should conclusively prove that I had the idea for Jurassic Park first! Now let's take a look at...
Hey! Ross!
Phoebe, oh my God! Wh-wh-what are you doing here?
I need to talk to you, it's pretty urgent. It's about Monica and Chandler.
Oh my God! Of course, of course. Umm, would you please excuse me for a moment? Umm, do you know each other's hometowns? Why don't you... Wh-what's going on?
Well, umm, not much. But, I was just thinking that since those guys just got engaged that maybe it would be nice if they had some privacy, y'know? So, could I just move in with you for a couple days?
Umm, okay, yeah, sure. But wh-what's wrong with Monica and Chandler?
Nothing-Why?!
Phoebe, you said it was urgent!
Oh yeah it is! I'm going to the movies and it starts in like five minutes.
Do you realize I have a classroom full of students?
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm so rude. Does anyone want to come to the movies?
All right, so I haven't cleared the budget with my parents yet, but tell me how this is for music.
Okay.
All right umm, a string quartet for the procession.
Aw.
A jazz trio for cocktails. The Bay City Rollers for dancing. Wait, that was from my sixth grade wedding.
Well, you couldn't get them anyway. Ian doesn't plan anymore and Derrick... And Derrick is a name I shouldn't know.
Hey Mon, do you have another pillow? Y'know, something a little snugglyer?
Why are you napping over here instead of over at your place?
Well, the duck...
What?! The duck?! What the hell did the damn duck do now?!
Uh, well he did not get sick somewhere in there and it was immediately found and properly cleaned up!
Now, do I get to look at this book or is it just for people who are actually involved in the wedding?
Of course you can look at it! Yeah, I want your opinion too!
Okay.
Here you go! What do you think about centerpieces?
Centerpieces!
Yeah! Roses or Lilies?
Definitely roses. Well, I just think they're a little more weddingy. But Lilies are the clear choice.
Oh my God! It's like one mind.
Uh-huh!
Guys! Guys!! You gotta let me nap! Ugh, I'm gonna get cranky!
Joey, there is a perfectly good couch across the hall!
Yes it is perfectly good, and it is not one of the places the duck got sick!
What?!
All right, I'm gonna go!
Now Joey, what did the duck do?!
I don't know! But he did not eat your face cream!
Hey little buddy, how are you feeling? What the hell is in that face cream? That's so soft. Pillowcases! Zelda looked at the chimney sweep. Her father, the vicar... The vicar? ...wouldn't be home for hours. Her loins were burning. She threw caution to the wind and reached out and grabbed his... Whoa! Whoa-ho-ho-ho! This is a dirty book!
Uh, Phoebe...
Oh Ross, hi.
Phoebe, what are you doing?
I'm sorry, I'm with a client right now.
Phoebe!
Okay, let's talk outside.
Phoebe, you can't massage people in my apartment!
What's the big deal? I did it at Monica and Chandler's!
And they knew about it?
Okay, well Ross, what is this really about?
Look, this is my home and I want to be able to come and go whenever I want!
Okay, I will find someplace else to do the rest of my appointments. I just don't know what the big deal is!
The big deal is I don't want naked, greasy strangers in my apartment when I want to kick back with a puzzle-beer! Cold beer.
Hey Joey, what 'cha doing?
Sweepin'. Why? Turn you on?
No.
Huh. What if I was sweeping a chimney?
Joey, did you my face cream?
Where are you going? The vicar won't be home for hours.
Joey, where did you learn that word?
Where do you think, Zelda?
You found my book?!
Yeah I did!
Joey, what-what are you doing going into my bedroom?!
Okay, look I'm sorry, I went in there to take a nap and I know I shouldn't have, but you got porn!
Hey-hey, y'know what? I don't care! I'm not ashamed of my book. There's nothing with a woman enjoying a little...erotica. It's just a healthy expression of female sexuality, which by the way, you will never understand.
You got porn!
Hello.
Hi, is uh Phoebe here?
Uh no-no, she-she's out for the night.
Ohh great.
Can I, can I help you with something?
Well, I don't know. Are you a masseur?
Yes I am.
Great! Dad! Thank you so much, I'll be back to pick him up in an hour.
So Chandler, you're parents must've been thrilled when you told them you were engaged.
Oh yeah, I should probably call them.
I remember when we first got engaged.
Oh, I don't think I ever heard that story.
Oh dad, really you don't need to...
Well, I'd gotten Judy pregnant. I still don't know that happened.
You don't know how that happened?! Your dog thought my diaphragm was a chew toy!
What a sweet story.
Well, at least you're not hearing it for the first time at your fifth grade Halloween party.
What?! They wanted a scary story!
Anyway, we're really excited about our wedding plans, and well I guess pretty soon we'll be making a big withdrawal from the Monica wedding fund. What?
You tell her Jack, I can't do it.
What happened? You still have the Monica wedding fund don't you?
We have it. Only now, we call it the beach house.
I don't believe you spent my wedding fund on the beach house!
We're sorry honey, but we just assumed if you got married after you turned 30 you'd pay for it yourself.
You bought the beach house when I was 23!
Which means you had seven years of beach fun and you can't put a price on that sweetie.
We really do feel bad about this though.
We started saving again when you were dating Richard and then that went to hell, so we redid the kitchen.
What about when I started dating Chandler?
Well it was Chandler! We didn't think he'd ever propose!
Clearly I did not start drinking enough at the start of the meal.
I can't believe it! That there is no money for my wedding?!
We might still have some money, if your father didn't think it was a good idea to sell ice over the Internet.
It seemed like such a simple idea.
Stupid Jack, the word is stupid.
All right, enough! I don't want to hear about it anymore! Good luck, Chandler.
Okay! Now, I'm going to touch you. Ohh, that's soft.
I can't believe this. Do you think that your parents could help pay for it?
I don't know, my mother spent most of her money on her fourth wedding. She's saving the rest for her divorce. And any extra cash my father has he saves for his yearly trips to Dollywood.
Well what happened at dinner?
My parents spent the money for our wedding!
My God! What did you order?!
Wait, but there's no money! Well this is terrible! You guys are gonna have to get married in like a, rec. center!
Honey, it's gonna be okay.
No! No it's not! It's not gonna be okay! It sucks! No swing band! No lilies!
No, y'know what? It's gonna be okay. I mean you don't have to have this rustic Italian feast. Y'know? And-and you don't need, you don't need this custom-made, empire waisted, duchess, satin gown; you can wear off the rack.
Look, it really is gonna be okay. The important thing is that we love each other and that we're gonna get married.
Do you even understand what off the rack means?!
Look, why don't you just pay for it yourself?
How? I don't have any money.
Well, I have some.
How much?
Well, close to...
Whoa!!! Are you kidding me?!
Well what?! How-how much is it?!
It's enough for wedding scenario eight.
Ohh! Really?!
How great are you, you little saver?! I mean, the-the amount you have is exactly the budget of my dream wedding!
Ohh, you guys are so made for each other.
Well, you're not suggesting that we spend all of the money on the wedding?
Ah, yeah!
Well, come on, I've been saving this money for six years and I kinda had some of it earmarked for the future, not just for a party.
Wow! Hello, Mr. Chandler.
This is the most special day of our lives.
No, I realize that honey, but I'm not gonna spend all of the money on one party.
Honey, umm I-I love you, but umm, if you call our wedding a party one more time, you may not get invited. Okay? Listen, we could always earn more money, okay? But uh, we're only gonna get married once.
Look, I understand, but I have to put my foot down. Okay? The answer is no.
You-you're gonna have to put your foot down?
Yes, I am!
Wow, money and a firm hand. Finally a Chandler I can get on board with.
Hey Rach.
Joey.
Hey Rach, do you smell smoke?
Uh-huh, I get it, smoke, chimney, chimney sweep, very funny, ha-ha.
No-no-no, I'm serious. You don't smell it? Something's on fire.
Well no, I don't smell anything.
Oh, y'know what? It's probably just your burnin' loins.
Hey, what are you guys, what are you guys talking about?
Nothing!
Damn, this coffee's cold! Hey Rach, do you mind if I heat this up on your loins?
Y'know, I can not believe you told him, Joey!
So I guess you bought that book after we broke up huh?
Uh-huh, yeah I did, because I wore out my first copy when I was with you.
Oh yeah, yeah? Well uh, when we were going out, I read tons of porno magazines! 'Sup?
Ross! How could you do that to an old man?!
Excuse me ladies. I'm sorry?
My massage client, Arthur? His daughter called and said that some guy that worked for me gave him a really weird massage this afternoon.
I gave him an extremely professional massage!
He said you poked at him with wooden spoons.
Okay, so it wasn't uh, a traditional massage. But I did give him accu-pressure with a pair of chopsticks. And, and I gently exfoliated him with, with a mop.
Well, he's never coming back! Okay? You just cost me eight dollars a week!
Hey, y'know what? This is your fault! You're the one that didn't move his-his appointment.
Oh, it's my fault?! You didn't have to massage him! You could've sent him away! You could've not rolled Tonka trucks up and down his back!
He said he liked that!! Oh you're right, you're right. I'm sorry.
Dude, what are you massaging an old man for?
His daughter was hot.
Gotcha.
Hey.
Hey.
Listen umm, I've been thinking, it's not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding. I mean, you work, you work really hard for that.
Ehh.
Eh, you work for that.
Look, I thought about it too, and I'm sorry. I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding.
You do?!
Yeah, I'm putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy then, then that's what we're gonna do.
Oh, you're so sweet. Oh, but wait, what about our, what about the future and stuff?
Eh, forget about the future and stuff! So we only have two kids, y'know? We'll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college.
You thought about that?
Yeah.
How many kids were we gonna have?
Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy.
What else did you think about?
Well, stuff like where'd we live, y'know? Like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Y'know, we could have a cat that had a bell on it's collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. Of course, we'd have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old.
Y'know what? I-I don't want a big, fancy wedding.
Sure you do.
No, I want everything you just said. I want a marriage.
You sure?
Uh-hmm.
I love you so much.
I love you. Hey listen umm, when, when you were talkin' about our future you said cat, but you meant dog right.
Oh yeah, totally!
Oh good.
Hello, Zelda.
Who are you supposed to be?
The vicar!
Do you even know what a vicar is?
Like a goalie, right?
Yeah. Look Joey, it's enough all right?! You keep making these stupid jokes and this sleazy innuendoes and it's-I'm not-it's just not funny anymore!
All right, I'm sorry. Rach I-Rach I'm sorry. Okay? I'm sorry! Maybe I can make up for it by, taking you roughly in the barn.
All right! Y'know what? That's it! You wanna do it?! Let's do it!
Huh?
That's right, I wanna do it with you! I've been trying to fight it, but you just said all the right things.
I-I-I-I did?
Yeah! Ohh, I've been waitin' so long to get on that body!
This body?
Yeah that's right! Come on Joey; sex me up!
Hey-hey, you're startin' to sound like the butcher's wife there in-in chapter seven.
Oh, come on now, don't keep me waiting. Get those clothes off! But, I would keep that helmet on because you're in for a rough ride!
I don't want to, I'm scared.
Hey, you guys!
Hey!
So, what do you think?
About what?
Yeah, what?
What?
Are you kidding? Okay, I'll give you a hint; I'll give you a hint.
Eyes! No, no. Your eyes! No. Chandler's eyes!
I got glasses!
Well, you-you've always had glasses.
No I didn't!
Are you sure?
Yeah-yeah, did-didn't you use to have a pair? They were really round, burgundy, and they made you look kind of umm...
Feminine.
Yes!
No!
Sweetie, I think the glasses look great. They make you look really sexy.
Really?
Yeah!
You didn't think I used to wear glasses, right?
Of course!
So what do you guys want for an engagement present?
That's okay Pheebs, we're not having a party or anything, so you don't have to get us...
If someone wants to give us a present, we don't want to deprive them of that joy.
Oh, y'know what you should get 'em? One of those little uh, portable CD players.
Oh, I already have one.
Not unless someone borrowed it and left it at the gynecologist.
Yeah, and-and-and by someone, she means Joey.
Hey, I know I what I want!
What we want honey.
No, you don't want this. I want to have your grandmother's cookie recipe.
You mean the chocolate chip cookie recipe?
Uh-huh, yeah.
You mean the one that my grandmother made me swear on her deathbed that I would never let out of our family?
Dying people say the craziest things.
I wanted it for years! I was gonna make cookies for my children.
Break my heart-Oh, all right.
Okay. I'm gonna be the mom that makes the world's best chocolate chip cookies.
Our kids are gonna be fat aren't they.
Ahoy!
Hey! How's the boat?!
Great! I'm finally getting into this sailing stuff.
Oh, so you finally took it out of the marina huh?
Why would I do that? It took three guys to get the thing in there!
If you don't sail your boat, what do you do on it?
Oh, it's great! It's a great place to just kinda, sit, hang around, drink a few beers, eat some chips.
Well, it's good that you finally have a place to do that.
Y'know Joey, I could teach you to sail if you want.
You could?
Yeah! I've been sailing my whole life. When I was fifteen my dad bought me my own boat.
Your own boat?
What?! What?! He was trying to cheer me up! My pony was sick.
Do you know what I was thinkin'?
What?
Nothing, I just like to go like this.
Hey Chandler, what are you doing tonight?
Uh why, do you have a lecture?
No, why?
Then free as a bird. What's up?
My dad wanted to know if you wanted to play racquetball with us.
Wow! That's great! Dad must really like you, he doesn't ask just anyone to play.
Yeah and he didn't really ask for you, he asked for Chancy, I assumed he meant you.
Well, did-did you correct him?
No, I-I thought it would be more fun this way.
This is so cool, maybe this is something you can do every week.
Or you can sit with him on the front porch and make sure no one steals the trash cans. He does that every week too.
Oh, just so you know, you-you have to let him win.
Yeah.
He hates to lose.
Oh no problem, maybe I'll play with my left hand.
You're not a lefty?
Does anybody know me?!
What's wrong Phoebe?
I just went to my old apartment to get you the-the cookie recipe and the stupid fire burned it up!
No!! Why didn't you make a copy and-and keep it in a fireproof box and keep it at least a hundred yards from the original?!!
Because I'm normal! That was the one legacy my grandmother left me, and I know you wanted it as an engagement present.
Oh, we have to get you an engagement present?
Don't worry about it Pheebs.
No one got me an engagement present.
Okay, here I wish you health and happiness.
An old cookie?
This is what happens when you don't register for gifts!
See no-no, I made a batch and I froze it, and this is the only one left.
We can't accept this.
Why not?
'Cause it's gross.
No! Wait! I think I can figure out the recipe from this cookie! I do stuff like this at work all the time.
Really?!
Yeah! I bet I can do it.
Okay, we owe you a present.
Two! I've been engaged twice!
Look at this clown! Just because he's got a bigger boat he thinks he can take up the whole river. Get out of the way jackass! Who names his boat Coast Guard anyway?
That is the Coast Guard.
What are they doing out here? The coast's all the way over there.
Joey, just ignore the boats all right? We're not finished with the lesson yet.
All right.
Okay, I'm just gonna go over the basic points just one more time, are you ready?
Come on Rach, not again. I got it! Okay? Let's start sailing, and I want to go over there where that boatload of girls is! Yo-ho-ho!
Oh, okay. Is that what you want to do? You wanna go over and give a little shout out to the old, hot chickas? Okay, let's do that Sailor Joe. Quick question though, what's this called?
Uh, boat rope.
Wrong! How do you get the mainsail up?
Uhh, rub it?
No. What do you do if I say we are coming about?
I'd say, come again. No-no, wait I-I-I know this one, I know this one, uh...
Time's up, now your dead.
And deaf!
Okay, you just go on and make your little jokey-jokes, but if you do not know what you are doing out at sea you will die at sea. Am I getting through to you sailor?!
Yes.
Don't just say yes! This isn't a game, Joey you can really get hurt out here. Okay, so do you want to pay attention or do you want to die?!
I want to make a ship to shore call to Chandler.
All right, I definitely taste nutmeg.
You do?
You don't? Well, that's the difference between a professional and a layman.
That and arrogance.
Hey.
Hey! How was sailing?
I don't want to talk about it. Y'know, you could've at least saved me a whole cookie.
No-wait-no-no!!!!!!!
Women are mean!!!
I can't believe that! Now the only thing left of my grandmother's legacy is this crumb. I wish you a long and happy marriage.
Hey.
Hey! How was it?
Well I had a great time! Umm, Chancy on the other hand...
I will tell the story! It was going great. I let him win. We were bonding. He even said I could call him dad.
And what did he ask you not to call him?
Daddy. All right look, here's the story. Well, we had just finished playing racquetball and we were gonna take a steam. I walk into the steam room and it was really steamy. So I take off my glasses and that's when in happened.
Guys?
Over here.
Have a seat son. Hey!!
Oh my God Chandler! I can't believe it!
I know.
You gave my father a lap dance!
Why do they put so much steam in there?!
'Cause otherwise they'd have to call it the room room.
Why? Okay? Why? Wh-wh-why did that have to happen?
Come on, it's not that big a deal!
Not that big a deal? There...there was touching of things.
Now, I know you wanted to bond with my dad, but did you really have to bond to that part?
Listen, I'm sure that dad doesn't care. He probably thought this was funny; he'll be telling this story for years!
I don't want him to tell this story for years.
Oh, but he will. He still tells the story how Monica tried to escape from fat camp.
I wasn't escaping.
Then how did you get caught in the barbed wire?
I was trying to help out a squirrel.
You were trying to eat it!
If that is your father calling to tell this story then the marriage is off!
Come on. Hello? I'm sorry you have the wrong number. Okay, I'll call you later dad. I love you.
All right, I'm off to see your dad.
Whoa-whoa, aren't you a little over dressed?
Yeah, and-and you better make sure he tips you this time.
Look, I figured I would try to convince him not to tell the story anymore, and I figure the best way to do that is face to face-And by face I don't mean his lap. And by face, I don't mean my ass.
Hey are you getting Monica and Chandler an engagement present?
I don't know. Y'know, they didn't get us anything.
Thank you!
Hey.
Hey.
Well hello! So, when are we gettin' back out on the water matey?
Oh uh, I don't know the boat way to say this, but uh never!
Why not?
Because! You're mean on the boat!
What? I was just trying to teach you.
Well, lesson learned! Rachel is mean!
Yeeeeeep... Yep-yep-yep-yep-yep. I remember when she took out on her dad's boat she wouldn't let me help at all.
Excuse me, I wanted you to help, but you couldn't move your arms because you were wearing three life jackets.
You have to respect the sea!
Look Joey, I'm sorry if-if you thought that was mean, but I gotta tell ya something. That was not mean. Okay, my father is mean. He used to yell at me all the time on the boat, I mean it was horrible. I was just being a good teacher.
Does a good teacher say, "Put down the beer pinhead!?"
Well, does a good student drink seven beers during his first lesson?
Six and a half! You knocked that last one out of my hand! Remember?
Yeah, I didn't want you to get hit by the boom!
Well it hit me anyway! And it would've hurt a lot less if I had finished that last beer.
All right, y'know what? I-I'm sorry. I will try to tone it down and uh stop yelling.
You won't boss me around anymore?
I won't boss you around.
And you'll be nice?
And, I'll be nice.
And you'll be topless?
And-Joey!
Do you want me to learn?!
Okay, here's batch 22. Ohh, maybe these'll taste a little like your grandmother's. This has a little bit of orange peel, but no nutmeg.
Let's give it a shot.
Okay. Man, I have not made this many cookies since I was in the ninth grade.
Oh, what was that for? Like a bake sale?
No, just a Friday night.
Ohh, these are pretty good.
Yeah, but not as good as batch 17.
Which one was that?
The ones we had right after you almost threw up.
Oh yeah! Batch 17 was good. I did not like batch 16. I'm okay.
Are there anymore from the good batch? 'Cause we could just work off of those.
Yeah, ooh yeah, I think there is one from batch 17 left, uh... It's batch 16! 16 people! Get out of the way!
Okay Joey honey, you're doing really good! All right, now I'm just gonna need you to step to the port side. Remember? Remember how we talked about the port side?
Ohh yeah.
Right?
Nope.
It's left sweetie, but that's okay sweetie, that's a tough one.
I don't know why you just don't say left.
Okay, go to the left. The left!
Huh?
Just sit over there!!
Okay! Okay, you're yelling again! See that?
No! No-no, no-no-no, very quiet, said with love, no yelling.
Oh, y'know what? Since I'm here, I think I'm gonna have me a little beer on the port side.
Okay Joey, we're luffing a little bit, so could you tighten up the cunningham?
Uh, wow, you just said a bunch of stuff I didn't know there.
Joey, come on! We just went over this!
Oh, y'know, when we did that was when that bird was flying overhead with the fish in his mouth. Did you see it? It was gross!
No! All right?! I did not see the bird! I did not see the fish! I did not see the piece of Styrofoam that was shaped like Mike Tyson! I did not, because I was trying to teach you how to sail a boat! Which obviously is an impossible thing to do!
All right that's it! You're yelling and I don't see you taking your top off! I quit!
What do you mean you quit?! You can't quit!
Why not?!
Because you're not finished yet and I won't have it! Greens do not quit!
Greens? I'm a Tribbiani! And Tribbianis quit!
Oh my God, wait did I-I just said Greens don't quit didn't I? Did I just say Greens don't quit?!
Yes! Yes! You did and you're still yelling at me!
No! No! No! I'm not yelling at you, I'm just yelling near you. Oh God Joey, ohh I'm my father. Oh my God, this is horrible! I've been trying so hard not to be my mother I did not see this comin'. Oh, Joey, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I just wanted you to learn.
Well, hey I did learn.
Really?
Yeah! Come on.
Awww...
Yeah, it's okay. I know what a mainsail is. I know, I know to duck when the boom comes across. I-I know port is right.
Left.
Damnit!
Y'know, I bet it would actually make my grandmother very happy to know that we're trying to figure out her recipe. I bet she's l-l-lookin' up at us and smiling right now.
Looking up?
Oh yeah-No, she was really nice to me, but she's in hell for sure.
Well, I've tried everything. I give up. I guess I'm not gonna be the mom who makes the world's best chocolate cookies. I do make the best duck confit with broccoli rabe. Kids love that right.
Aww, Pheeb, come on isn't there any relative that would have the recipe? What about, what about your sister?
Oh no-no, no, I made a promise to myself that the next time I would talk to Ursula would be over my dead body. And that's not happening 'til October 15th, 2032.
That's the day you're gonna die? See-darnit, I've got shuffleboard that day.
That's what you think.
Well, I mean what about friends of your grandmother's? Wouldn't they have the recipe?
Well, y'know I may have relatives in France who would know. My grandmother said she got the recipe from her grandmother, Nesele Tolouse.
What was her name?
Nesele Toulouse.
Nestle Tollhouse?!
Oh, you Americans always butcher the French language.
Phoebe, is this the recipe?
Yes!! Ohh.
I cannot believe that I just spent the last two days trying to figure out the recipe and it was in my cupboard the whole time!
I know! You see it is stuff like this which is why you're burning in hell!!
So you understand, I'd feel a lot more comfortable if you didn't tell people what happened. Y'know, I'm a little...I'm a little embarrassed about it.
I understand completely, there's nothing more horrifying than embarrassing yourself in front of your in-laws. As a matter of fact, when I started dating Judy I was unemployed, and her father asked me what I did for a living and I told him I was a lawyer.
What did you do when they found out?
They never did, so if ever see me giving them legal advice just nod along. Shall we?
So I guess we wear swimsuits in here!
Well Joey, I hate to admit it, your way of sailing is a lot more fun.
Yeah, yeah. Hey, why don't you give a pull on that rope?
Ohh we're not sailing.
Just pull on it.
All right. Hey-hey-hey!! Sandwiches!
What else?
Here you go.
Thank you.
Oh wow!
What are you doing?
Ohh, sorry.
What you-don't hold it like that! You're lettin' all the good stuff fall out.
Ohh whoops.
Careful! You're wasting good pastrami! Oh my God! I'm my dad!
Well, if we learned one thing today C.H.E.E.S.E. is that cheerleaders and high explosives don't mix.
You can say that again Mac.
Well, I couldn't have done it without you buddy. You're a genius.
Oh yeah? Well then how come I can't get my VCR to stop blinking 12:00?
So, what did you guys think?
Hello? Hold on please. Joey, it's your mom.
It's your mommy. It's your mommy.
Ohhhh...
That's nice.
Mom, so what did you think?
Well that was umm...Okay.
It wasn't the best.
That was one of the worse things ever. And not just on TV.
Wh-what are we gonna tell him?
Well, the lighting was okay.
Ohh no you don't! You got lighting last time, lighting is mine!
And I have costumes.
Oh great! That means I'm stuck with, "So, we were watching you in there and you were sittin' right here! Whoa!"
What are you gonna do Pheebs?
I don't know. I don't know. I can't lie to him again. Oh no I-no! I'm just gonna press my breasts up against him.
And say nothing?
Uh-huh, yeah that's right.
Wow! Well, my folks really liked it! So what-what did you guys think? It wasn't that good.
Phoebe, do you think that your favorite animal says much about you?
What? You mean behind my back?
Oh! Hi you guys, oh my God! You'll never gonna believe happened to me today! I am sitting in my office and...
You guys! You guys! You're not gonna believe what my agent just told me!
Joey! Kinda in the middle of a story here!
Ooh, sorry. Sorry. You finish, go.
Okay, so anyway I'm sittin' in my office and guess who walks in.
I'm gonna be on two TV shows!
Oh, that's great!!
Joey!
Oh, you weren't finished?
Yeah! Guess who walks into my office is the end of my story. It was Ralph Lauren! Ralph Lauren walked into my office!
Uh Rach, if you're gonna start another story, at least let me finish mine.
It's the same story.
Wow, it's really long.
Anyway, Ralph just came in to tell me that he's so happy with my work that he wants me to be the new merchandising manager for polo retail.
Still get a discount on wedding dresses?
Yeah!
I'm so happy for you!
Well, these really are the days of our lives.
What?!
Well, since you ask. They want me back on Days of Our Lives!
Oh God!
I got-I get a big pay raise!
Oh hey!
I'll be playing Drake Remoray's twin brother, Stryker!
Oooh!
I get to hire my own assistant!
Ahhh!!
Well-I got a head rush from standing up to fast right there.
And you were at this job for four years?
That's right.
Okay, well this is all very impressive Hilda, um I just have one last question for you. Uh, how did I do? Was this okay?
What?
I've never interviewed anyone before. I've actually never had anyone work for me before. Although when I was a kid, we did have a maid, but this is-this isn't the same thing.
No dear. It's not.
No. Yeah, and I know that. All right, well thank you so much for coming in it was nice to meet you.
Thank you! Good meeting you.
All right. I'm a total pro!
Hello?
Wow! H-umm! Hi! Yes, uh I'm sorry the models are actually down the hall.
Actually, I'm here about the assistant job.
Really?! Okay well then, all right, well just have a seat there. Umm, so what's-what is-what's your name?
Tag Jones.
Uh-huh, go on.
That's it. That's my whole name.
That's your whole name, okay of course it is! Okay, well let's-let's just have a look-see here.
I know I haven't worked in an office before, and I really don't have a lot of experience, but uh...
Oh come on, what are you talking about? You've got three years painting houses. Two whole summers at T.G.I. Friday's, come on!
It's lame, I know. But I'm a goal-oriented person, very eager to learn...
Okay, hold on just a second. I'm sorry, it's for human resources, everybody has to do it. Could you just stand up please?
No-no-no-no. Hey!
Anyway, I should go. Okay, bye.
Hey sweetie.
Hi sweetie. So, what was with all the whispering?
I can't tell you. It's a secret.
Secret? Married people aren't supposed to have secrets between one another. We have too much love and respect for one another.
Awww. But still no.
No I'm serious, we should tell each other everything. I do not have any secrets from you.
Really? Okay, so why don't you tell me what happened to Ross Junior year at Disneyland?
Oh no-no, I can't do that.
If you tell me, I'll tell you what Phoebe said.
Okay.
Okay.
So, Ross and I are going to Disneyland and we stop at this restaurant for tacos. And when I say restaurant, I mean a guy, a hibachi, and the trunk of his car. So Ross has about 10 tacos. And anyway, we're on Space Mountain and Ross starts to feel a little iffy.
Oh my God. He threw up?
No, he visited a little town south of throw up. So what was Phoebe's secret?
Oh, Nancy Thompson from Phoebe's old massage place is getting fired.
That's it?! I gave up my Disneyland story for that?
That's right! You lose sucker!! Please still marry me.
Chandler, you have an assistant right?
Did she call? You-you told her I was sick right? Always tell her I am sick!
No, I-I just don't know how you decide who to hire. I mean I've got it narrowed down to two people. One of them has great references and a lot of experience and then there's this guy...
What about him?
I love him. He's so pretty I wanna cry! I don't know what to do. Tell me what to do.
Come on you know what to do! You hire the first one! You don't hire an assistant because they're cute, you hire them because they're qualified.
Uh-huh. No, I hear what you're saying and-and-and that makes a lot of sense but can I just say one more thing? Look how pretty!
Let's see. Oh my God! Oh... But no! No! You can't-you can't hire him, because that-it's not professional. Umm, this is for me yes? Thanks.
Okay you're right. I'll hire Hilda tomorrow. Dumb old perfect for the job Hilda!
Let me see this guy. W-H-Wow! Don't show this to Monica! And don't tell her about the W-H-Wow!
Hey-hey-hey Joey!
Hey Terry!
Good to see you again!
It's been a while, huh? Wow, it's funny these halls look smaller then they used to.
It's a different building.
So! Stryker Remoray huh? When do you want me to start?
Why don't we start right now!
Okay.
Here are the audition scenes.
Audition? I thought you were gonna offer me the part.
Why would you think that?
Well, I was Dr. Drake Remoray, Stryker's twin brother. I mean, who looks more me than me right?
Everybody has to audition.
Y'know Terry, I-I don't really need to do this. I got my own cable TV series, with a robot.
I'm sorry Joey that's...that's the way it is.
Well. I guess you think you're pretty special huh? Sittin' up here in your fancy small hall building. Makin' stars jump through hoops for ya, huh? Well y'know what? This is one star who's hoop... This is a star that the hoop-this hoop-I was Dr. Drake Remoray!
Hi! Tag. What are you doing here?
I just wanted to come by and thank you for not laughing in my face yesterday. And I noticed there aren't any plants in your office so I wanted to bring you your first... There is a plant in your office.
Kinda.
Right. So I guess I shouldn't put good at noticing stuff on my resume.
Oh-ohh, thank you.
Anyway, I'm guessing you hired somebody.
Well...
Gotcha. Thanks again for meeting with me.
But I hired you!
What?
Yeah! You-you got the job! You're my new assistant!
I am?!
Yeah!
I can't believe it!
Me either. Umm, all right, first thing I need you to do is go downstairs and find a women named Hilda and tell her to go home.
Hey.
Hey! Good, you're home!
Oh it's always nicer to here than, "Aw crap! You again!"
Hey baby.
Hey.
I made you a surprise.
Oh yeah?
Yeah, tacos! Ever since you told me that story I've had such a craving for them.
Did you not understand the story?
Hey!
Hey! What's up?
Ross!
Oh, nothin' much. Just trying to figure out what I'm gonna do for dinner.
Huh.
Hey-Ooh! What's-what's that, dinner stuff? You making dinner?
No! Shhh!
What you got over there? Tacos?
No! No. They're umm... They're just uh...ground beef smileys.
Uhh, those are tacos.
Excuse me Mr. Mexico.
Eh, either way I'll pass. I still can't eat those. What's so funny?!
I'm not laughing.
You told her!
Nancy Thompson's getting fired!
Look, okay-okay I had food poisoning! It's not like I choose to do it! It's not like-It's not like I said, "Umm, what would make this ride more fun?!"
You're right. I mean I'm sorry. Yeah, I shouldn't be laughing. I should be laying down papers for you!
How could you tell her?!
I had too okay?! We're getting married! Married couples can't keep secrets from one another!
Oh really? Well I-I guess Monica should know about Atlantic City.
Du-ude!
What happened in Atlantic City?!
Well, Chandler and I are in a bar...
Did you not hear me say, "Du-ude?!"
And this girl is making eyes at Chandler, okay? So after awhile he-he goes over to her and uh, after a minute or two, I see them kissing. Now, I know what you're thinking, Chandler's not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with girls, and you're right, Chandler's not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with...girls.
You kissed a guy?!! Oh my God.
In my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy.
Oh Mon, I laughed so hard...
Ho-ho, so hard we had to throw out your underwear again?
Whatever dude, you kissed a guy.
Hi!
Hey.
Hey-Ooh, how's Hilda? Is she working out?
Ohh, my new assistant is working out, yes.
Was she happy you gave her the job?
Oh, my-my new assistant has very happy that I hired my new assistant.
Hello? Oh hey! Can you, can you hang on a second? It's the producers over at Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E. can you excuse me for a minute? Hey, funny you should call. I was just looking over next week's script. Canceled?! Like they're taking it off the air? Ohh. All right, see you Monday. We're not even shootin' them anymore?!! All right, bye! They canceled Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E!
Sorry.
I'm sorry Joey.
Why would they do that?! It was a good show right?!
You wanna tell secrets?! Okay! Okay! In college, Ross used to wear leg warmers!
All right! All right! Chandler entered a Vanilla Ice look-a-like contest and won!
Ross came in forth and cried!
Oh my God!
Oh, is that funny?! Oh, you-you find that funny?! Well maybe Chandler should know some of your secrets too!
I-I already told him everything! You shush!!
Once Monica was sent to her room without dinner, so she ate the macaroni off a jewelry box she'd made.
Ross used to stay up every Saturday night to watch Golden Girls!
Monica couldn't tell time 'til she was 13!
It's hard for some people!
Of course it is. Wow-whoa!
Chandler one time wore my underwear to work!
Hey!!!
Ohh, I'm sorry I couldn't think of anymore for Ross!
Ohh! Ohh! In college, Chandler got drunk and slept with the lady who cleaned our dorm!
That was you!
Whatever dude, you kissed a guy.
How could this happen to me?! Yesterday I had two TV shows! Today, I got nothin'!
Well wait a minute, what happened to Days of Our Lives?
Uh, well they might be a little mad at me over there.
What happened?
Well maybe I got a little upset and maybe I told them where they could go.
Joey, why would you do that?
Because they wanted me to audition!
You! An actor?! That's madness!
Rachel Green's office.
Tag? Hi, who was that?
Nobody. I was just practicing.
Really?
Hi!
Hi! Rachel Green's office.
You must be Hilda.
Yeah, this is Tag. Tag, this is Phoebe. Phoebe, can I see you for a second?
Phoebe! That's a great name.
Oh, you like that? You should hear my phone number.
Okay. We'll be right back.
So you hired yourself a little treat did ya?
All right I know, I know how it looks Pheebs, but I'm telling you...
But-but you know you cannot get involved with your assistant.
Yes, I know that. I know that. And I know that hiring him was probably not the smartest thing that I've ever done. But I'm telling you, from this moment on I swear this is strictly professional. Yes?
Hey Rachel!
Hi!
Cute assistant! What's his story? Is he...
Gay? Yeah.
Hey! Terry.
Joey Tribbiani! I'm surprised your big head could fit through our small halls! I gotta go Joey.
Wait! Terry! Wait-Look-Wait I-I... Look, I'm really sorry about before. I was an idiot thinking I'm too big to audition for you. You gotta give me another chance.
I can't help you Joey.
Wait! Terry! Please! Look, I just lost my other job. Okay? You have no idea how much I need this. Please, help me out, for old times sake.
This poor guy's been in a coma for five years. It's hopeless.
It's not hopeless! Dr. Stryker Remoray's a miracle worker. Look, here he comes.
Good morning. Drake, it's your brother Stryker. Can you hear me?
And cut!
I'm back baby! Ha-ha-ha!
Y'know, in my defense, umm there was no glitter on the macaroni and very little glue.
And in my defense, the cleaning lady came on to me!
You have no trouble telling time now right?
No!
Quick! What time is it?!
I don't know! Time to kiss a guy maybe?! What are you laughing at Pampers?
Y'know when I said that because we're getting married that we should share everything and not have any secrets?
Yeah?
Yeah that was stupid. Let's not do that.
Ohh, absolutely.
And! We should keep all the stuff uh, we told each other secret from everybody else.
Yeah, definitely!
Okay, if you'll excuse me, I-I'm gonna go hang out with some people who don't know the Space Mountain story.
Then, I'd steer clear of Phoebe.
Man!
Yeah, and not that you would, but I wouldn't hang out with...all the guys in my office.
Hi!
Do you have a minute?
Well yeah, sure, what's up?
I got asked out twice today when I was at lunch...by guys.
Oh really?!
Yeah. Did you tell someone that I was gay?
Oh, did you not want people to know that?
But I'm not gay. And I especially wouldn't want you to think I was gay.
Why's that?
I don't think I should say.
Ohh, you can say. Come on, I don't want you to feel like you can't tell me things.
Okay.
'Kay.
Well...
Yeah.
I'd love to ask out your friend Phoebe.
Yeah, she's gay.
Hey.
What's the matter?
Someone on the subway licked my neck! Licked my neck!!
Oh Willie's still alive!
What are you guys doing?
Oh, my mom called, they're gonna run our engagement announcement in the local paper, so we're looking for a good picture of us.
Oooh, I'm afraid that does not exist.
That's not true, there are great pictures of us!
No, there are great pictures of you standing next to a guy who's going like this...
Oh my God! That's the creep that you're with at the Statue of Liberty.
I don't know what it is, I just can't take a good picture.
Oh, here's a great one.
Yeah, I'm not in that.
I know, but look at me all tan.
Hey, why don't you guys go, get portraits done by a professional photographer.
That's a good idea! I bet they have one of those wind machines! Y'know...
Yeah that's great! Next to that, Chandler won't look so stupid.
Chandler what do you say?
All right, but I should warn you, I'm not going. I'm going.
Dude, that reverse lay-up! Oh...
How about those three pointers?
Amazing!
And those guys were this close to lettin' us play this time too.
Hey look-look, Phoebe's talking to uh, Cute Coffeehouse Guy.
Oh, you guys call him Cute Coffeehouse Guy, we call him Hums While He Pees.
Yes, and we call Ross Lingers In The Bathroom.
Hey you guys, Hums While He Pees just asked me out!
Hey, I thought that guy was married.
He is! But he's getting divorced-Ross! Maybe you know him.
It's not a club.
Phoebe, if this guy's going through a divorce, is it such a good idea to start going out with him?
Hey, divorced men are not bad men!
They have that on the napkins at the club.
Oh, I gotta get back to work.
You don't have to be back for a half-hour!
Yeah but, my assistant Tag does sit-ups in the office during lunch. Ohh! I could just spread him on a cracker.
Rach, if you have a crush on this guy, why would you hire him? I mean y'know you can't date him right?
Oh no, I know that. I know that. Although, we made a joke that we spend so much time together he should call me his work wife.
Soon he'll be able to call you, that lady he knew who got fired.
I am not gonna get fired, because I'm not gonna act on it.
So you wouldn't mind if he was dating someone else?
Why? Is he? He is! Isn't he? He's dating that slut in marketing!
Maybe I should open a divorced men's club.
Dude that is so sad.
I could put uh-uh a basketball court in the back.
Could I play?
Oh, no sit-ups today Tag?
I just did them.
Oh, well drop and give me ten more!
What?
Uh, I-I had a drink with lunch. Did those cost reports come in?
Yeah, I filled them out last night?
Oh, great could you make me four copies of those?
Hey Rachel!
Ahh, hi! Hi! Melissa, what's up? I'm just uh, about to umm, go out to the store to get some stuff to put in my backpack. Y'know, like dried fruit and granola and stuff. What's up?
Umm, is Tag here?
No. Why?
Oh, I was gonna talk to him about doing something tonight.
Really?! Got a little crush on Tag there do ya?
Well, we've been flirting back and forth, but I was hoping that tonight it would turn into something a little more than that.
Okay, whoa-whoa easy there Melissa! This ain't a locker room, okay? But, y'know I remember him saying that-that he had plans tonight.
Oh no!
Oh yeah. All right, back to work.
Hey! Isn't that Tag's backpack.
Yeah Melissa, I don't want to be known as the uh, office bitch, but I will call your supervisor.
Great! That's great Monica! Great! Now, Chandler, you want to give us a smile?
Okay.
I'm sorry, is the seat uncomfortable?
No, I am.
Chandler, listen to me sweetie, I know you can do this. Okay? You have a beautiful smile.
I do?
Yeah! All right, maybe you don't have to smile. Let's try something else. Let's try umm, try looking sexy.
Okay.
Or not.
Hi Joey! What are you doing here?
Uhh, well I've got an audition down the street and I spilled sauce all over the front of my shirt. You got an extra one?
Yeah, sure. Umm...here.
Great. You got anything that's not Ralph Lauren?
Yeah, I don't think so Joe.
All right, I guess this will be fine.
Hey, listen umm, what-what are you doing tonight?
Nothing, why?
How would you feel about taking out my assistant Tag? I'll pay.
Huh, Rach I got to say it's gonna take a lot of money for me to go out on a date with a dude.
I'm not asking you to go on a date with him!
Really? 'Cause I could kinda use the money.
Joey, just-just he-he's new in town and I know he doesn't have any guy friends. Just take him to like a ball game or something. I'll really appreciate it.
Yeah, okay.
Yeah?
Sure, no problem. Ooh-Hey, donuts!
Yeah!
Okay.
I know. Let's try a look...of far off...wonderment. Okay, we'll-we'll gaze into our future and we'll think about our marriage and the days to come. Chandler! What is the matter with your face?! I mean this picture is supposed to say "Geller and Bing to be married," not "Local woman saves drowning moron!" Hey! Don't laugh at him! He's my drowning moron!
Aww!
That's it! Take it! Take it! Take it!
I like this one. It seems to say, "I love you and that's why I have to kill you."
They can't all be bad. Find the one where you make your bedroom eyes. Ohh, there it is.
Oh my God! Those are my bedroom eyes?! Why did you ever sleep with me?
Do you really want to pull at that thread?
I'm having a really good time!
Me too! I'm sorry that guy in the subway licked your neck.
Ohh. No that's okay, he's a friend.
Hey uh, I don't mean to be presumptuous but I have these two tickets to the ballroom dancing finals tomorrow night if you want to go?
Yeah, I... Well y'know I-I mean I missed the-the semi-finals, so I'd just be lost.
I know it's really lame, but I got these tickets from my boss and-Oh no! No! No! My God!
Okay, don't freak out. I'll go.
No it's... Uh, my ex-wife Whitney is out there. I cannot deal with her right now. That woman is crazy!
Okay, I know. Hold on. Hey Ross?
Yeah?
Yeah, umm that's Whitney , Kyle's ex-wife out there, now do you think that you can y'know divert her so that we can slip out?
What?! No!
Well okay but I have two tickets to the ballroom dance finals.
Look, I don't think so Pheebs. All right, I'll do it. But just because you're a friend.
Hi Ginger.
All right! I want my key back!
I don't have it!
It's right there!
Ugh, okay Sherlock!
Look, I'm sorry but you-you-you better go Pheebs.
All right, well I just wanted to say thank you though for diverting Kyle's ex.
Oh yeah-No-You're welcome. We'll talk about it later.
Okay.
Hi Whitney.
Hi Ross! You ready for breakfast?
Yep. Okay.
Kyle's ex-wife? You were supposed to divert her not date her!
Hi! I'm sorry, but can you give me a second while I talk to this woman, who by the way did not spend the night.
Sure.
Okay. I did divert her and we ended up having a great time! Okay?
Watching ballroom dancing?
Yes! That's where we realized we were both super cool people!
Well look-look, okay Ross, Kyle just told me some really bad stuff about her.
Like what?
Like she's really mean, and she's over critical, and-and-No! She will paint a room a really bright color without even checking with you!
Okay.
And! She uses sex as a weapon!
Fine! Thank you for warning me. At breakfast I'll be on full alert for room painting and sex weapons.
You're still gonna go out with her?!
Yeah!
Well, didn't you just hear what I said?!
Pheebs come on! I mean, consider the source! Of course her ex-husband's gonna say that stuff. Now, if you'll excuse me...
No listen to me! She is crazy!
Uh, your door isn't sound proof.
You see? Nothing is good enough for her!
Good morning.
Hi Tag! Hey, so did you have fun with uh, with Joey last night?
Oh yeah! We went to the Knicks game.
Ohh that's nice.
Then we went to this bar and he hooked us up with all these women!
Wo-women? You mean like old women?
Well kinda old, like 30.
Oh.
And I never used to be able to just talk to girls in bars, but I got like 20 phone numbers last night.
That's great! Wow man, so Joey must've really taught you some stuff huh?
A little.
Yeah?
How you doin'?
See? That's a great smile! Easy. Natural. Now, pretend I have a camera. You're changing it!
I can't help it!
All right, all right, all right, all right, you wanna know what I do when I take resume shots?
Borrow money from me?
Okay, first-first of all, you want to make it look spontaneous. I look down , look down, keep looking down; then I look up. See? All right, now you try. Look down , you're looking down, keep looking down...
Why is there jelly on your shoe?
I had a donut.
Hi!
Hey!
Hey!
So uh, heard you had some fun with Tag last night.
Yeah! That guy's all right!
Yeah and you had fun teaching him how to be all Joey.
What?
Y'know, all the women.
Hey well, you can't teach someone to be good with women. Y'know, that's why I never had any luck with Chandler.
I'm right here!
All right, would-would you mind just not going out with him again? Okay, just the idea of you and he and all these women, it's just-And I know he's my assistant and I can't date him-but it just bothers me, all right?!
Hey! No-no-no-no, you can't take him away from me! I got a great partner to pick up girls with! Finally!!
I'm still right here!
All right, will you, will you at least tell him how hollow and unsatisfying this, dating tons of women thing is!
What?!
I just don't want him to meet anybody until I am over my crush-And I will get over it. It's-it's not like I love him, it's just physical! But-I mean I get crushes like this all the time! I mean hell, I had a crush on you when I first met ya!
I know, Monica told me.
Did you have a crush on me, when you first met me?
Yeah. Sure.
Can you people not see me?!
So, will you talk to him?
I don't know Rach.
Oh, come on! I'll give you ten free Ralph Lauren shirts.
One! No ten! You said ten! You can't take that back!
Hey Joey, you wanted to talk to me?
I don't know. You uh, you got something for me?
Oh, yeah, this is from Rachel.
Ten. Okay. Now Tag there's such a thing as to many women.
Really?
Yeah, for you!
Hey! There you are!
There I am!
Are you okay?
Yeah, Joey said I uh, I needed to relax so he gave me an antihistamine.
What?!
Yeah, and then I fell asleep on the subway and went all the way to Brooklyn. Brooklyn is f-far!!
Chandler, what were you thinking?
I don't know, but don't worry, don't worry, because I know how to take a picture now. Okay, see? Look down , look down, look down...
Chandler?
Yeah!
Hi.
Hi.
So, how are things going with crazy? Has she cooked your rabbit yet?
Listen, you are hearing one side of the story, okay-and F.Y.I she must've shown Kyle over 30 paint samples before she painted that room! And his response to each one was, "I don't give a tiny rat's ass."
Yeah well, maybe she should've spent a little less time decorating and a little more time in the bedroom.
Well, I don't think we are gonna have that problem, but maybe that's just because I am not emotionally unavailable!
You think he's emotionally unavailable?
I think he can be.
Well, maybe he wouldn't be she didn't bring the office home every night!
Well, excuse her for knowing what she wants to do with her life!
Yeah well, she certainly knew what she was doing New Year's Eve 1997.
I knew you were gonna throw that in my face!! That was three years ago! She apologized and she apologized! What more do you want?!!
We want the last six years back!!
So do we!! So do we!! I'm sorry you had to see that.
Good morning Rachel.
Hi! Thanks, hey so uh what'd you do last night?
Went out with Joey.
Oh yeah? Another night of birdogging the chickas?
No. We had a really good talk. I don't think I'm gonna do that bar scene anymore.
Wow! I did not see that coming.
It's just not really who I am. Y'know, I've always been happier when...Why am I telling you this? You don't care about this stuff.
Oh no, yes I do! I do! I mean, come on go on, you were, you were saying I am happier when uh, y'know?
When I'm in a relationship, I love having a girlfriend.
Really?
Someone I can spoil, y'know?
Sp-spoil?
Uh-huh! Let me ask you something?
Uh-huh.
Do you believe that there is one perfect person for everyone?
Well, I-I'm startin' too.
And if that person is already in your life, you should do something about it right?
Yes! Hell yes!
All right then, it's settled.
Okay.
I'm gettin' back together with my ex-girlfriend.
I'd love to!
What?
Hello?! Oh, yeah! This is gonna be a while. Excuse me. Yeah!
My God!
Oh, I'm sorry. Is that annoying? And speaking about being selfish in bed, how's Whitney?
Well maybe she wouldn't have to be selfish in bed if someone else knew where everything was!
Oh he knows! For the most part.
Oh hey! Good, you're both here.
We kinda need to talk.
Both of you together?
Wh-what's up?
Well, I went over to Kyle's last night to pick up a few things and we got to reminiscing...
...we talked through most of the night and we realized that the reason we were so angry at each other was because there are still feelings there. So...
Oh just say it Kyle!
We're gonna give it another try.
What about her whining and her constant need for attention?!
I'm gonna work on that.
Oh right, because you're so capable of change.
Y'know, he hums when he pees!
I do know.
It makes him miss the bowl, but whatever.
We're so sorry.
That's all right, we-we don't need you. In fact, hey I'm over it already.
Yeah, and y'know what? I don't give a tiny rat's ass.
Yeah, we're gonna go.
I'm sorry. Ugh, Pheebs, you were, you were right about her. Y'know, she did try to use sex as a weapon! Yeah, I hurt my back a little.
Oh. Y'know, he hums while he does other stuff to.
Yeah, were better off without them.
And y'know, even if they break up again, you'd better not let him in your sad men's club!
Divorced men's club.
Potato, Potaato.
Hey guys check it out! My mom sent me the paper!
Ooh, let's see it!
Ahhh.
Okay.
Oh yeah, that looks good.
You guys make a very attractive couple.
Yeah, we look great together.
Yeah, we really do!
Okay.
Wow! Imagine what our kids would look like!
Y'know, we don't have to imagine.
I'm marrying her.
We'll just see.
Okay, the reason why I asked you guys out to brunch today is because I have been doing some thinking about who should be my maid of honor.
Oh my God! This is it! I really hope it's you!
I hope it's you.
Me too!
First of all um, I love you both so much and you're both so important to me...
Okay, bla-bla-bla-bla!! Who is it?!
Well umm, I was thinking that maybe we could come up with a system where we trade of being maid of honor for each other. Like hypothetically, if Phoebe were mine...
Yes!!! Oh!!
Hypothetically!
Still.
If Phoebe were my maid of honor...
Uh-hmm.
Rachel would be Phoebe's, I would be Rachel's, that way we all get to do it once and no one would get upset.
Yeah that's actually a pretty good idea.
Yeah, I'll do that. So who gets to be yours?
Well that's the best part. Umm, you guys get to decide!
Wh-why is that the best part?
Because then I don't have to!
Well of course we will help you decide! We will do anything we can to help you! Now, I would like to make a toast, to the future Mrs. Chandler Bing , my best friend, and truly one of the nicest people that...
I'm really not deciding!
Fine!
Excuse me, I-I couldn't help overhearing, you're marrying Chandler Bing?
Yeah that's right.
Huh, good luck!
Aww, and good luck to you too! What a nice lady!
Die Hard still great!
Yep. Hey, what do you say we make it a double feature?
What'd you rent?
Die Hard 2.
Joey, this is Die Hard 1 again.
Oh, well we watch it a second time and its Die Hard 2!
Joey, we just saw it!
And?
And it'll be cool to see it again! Yeah!
Die Hard!!!!!!
Dude, you didn't say Die Hard. Is everything okay?
Yeah, I just got uh, got plans.
Well, John McLane had plans!
No, see the thing is I want to get out of here before Joey gets all worked up and starts calling everybody bitch.
What are you talking about? Bitch.
Hey Rachel?
Yeah?
Umm, when I get married will you be my maid of honor?
Really?!
Uh-hmm.
Oh my God Phoebe! I mean I'm just-Wait a minute. If I'm your maid of honor that means you are Monica's.
Oh! Well, if that's what you want...
Ohh! No way Phoebe! I want to be Monica's!
But why does it even matter?!
Why does it matter so much to you?!
Because this one is now! And-and it's two of our best friends! Who knows what you're gonna marry!
What-what if I marry Ross-Or Joey?
You wouldn't! Okay look, Rachel I know you really want to do this, but I-I've never been maid of honor to anyone before! And I know you've done it at least twice!
Yeah but Phoebe...
And no, oh please, oh please let me finish. Oh I guess that was it.
Okay. Okay. It's-since you've never done it before you can be Monica's made of honor.
Oh, thank you so much! Okay.
I'm gonna marry someone good y'know.
Oh I know.
Better than Chandler.
What happened?!!
Well, I don't know!!
We fell asleep! That is all.
Yeah. Yep. Yeah. All right, well uh, I'd better go.
I think that would be best.
Yeah. All right, I'll talk to you later.
Okay. But not about this!
No! Never! Never! Bye.
No touch! No touch!
Yeah hey, a weird thing happened today whey I was at brunch. This woman overheard that I was marrying you and-and then she...she wished me good luck.
That's sweet.
No, it's more like a good luck.
So uh, what did this woman look like?
She was like 30, dark hair, attractive.
Well, is there any chance you were looking into a bright, shiny thing called a mirror?
Come on, was it somebody maybe you dated in college?
No, no I only dated two girls in college, both blonde, both not attractive... Hold on one second; let me check this out. (He gets up and grabs a photo album.
What are you doing?
Well, let's see... Okay uh, is that her?
Oh my God yes! Who is she?
Julie Grath, my camp girlfriend.
Did you break up with her?
No, we're still together. Yeah we went out for two summers, and then I broke up with her.
Why?
Well, 'cause she came back the third summer and she'd gotten really fa-aa-aw-ow...
Fat?!
I did not say fat! I said, "Fa-aa-aw-ow..."
You broke up with a girl because she was fat?!
Yeah. Yeah, but it was a really, really long time ago! Does she still feel bad?
Well, apparently she does.
Well, you know what they say, elephants never forget. Seriously, good luck marrying me.
Hey! What's going on?
Phoebe is gonna be Monica's maid of honor!
Hey! Well I hope it goes better than the last time you did it for that girl downstairs, remember?
You have been maid of honor before?!!
See? This is exactly why you shouldn't lie!
All right that's it! I am maid of honor!
Na-uh, I am!
How come you are?!
Because I cared enough to lie!
Hey-hey-hey-hey, I can help you decide who should do it! Yeah, we could have like uh, like an audition and see how you'd handle maid of honor type situations.
What are you talking about?
Like when I want a job, I go to an audition and if I'm the best of the people they see, they give me the part.
Okay, so after this audition, who decides who gets it?
Oh uh, me and Ross can be the judges.
Well, it's better than us deciding.
Oh, come on! This is crazy! Can't we just flip a coin?!
No! Coins hate me!
Okay. Okay fine, y'know what? We will let Ross and Joey decide. Hiiiii, Ross! Sweetie.
Hey there, you handsome thing.
Wow, this cologne really is every bit as good as Georgio.
Hi.
Just uh, brought back your videos.
Uh hey look uh Ross, look I think we need to talk about before.
No! No we don't!
Yes we do! Now look, that was the best nap I ever had!!
I... I don't know what you are talking about.
Come on! Admit it! That was the best nap you ever had!
I've had better.
Okay! When?!
All right! All right! It was the best nap ever!
Uh-huh!
I've said it! Okay?! But it's over Joey!
I want to do it again.
We can't do it again.
Why not?
Because it's weird!
Fine! Do you want something to drink?
Sure, what do you got?
Warm milk and Excedrin P.M.
Chandler! Chandler! I just figured out who you are!
Can you figure out what I'm doing?
You're Lewis Posin.
Who?
Lewis Posin! He was my best friend in fifth grade, and-and then one day I asked him to be my boyfriend and he said no. Do you know why?
Because you kept talking to him while he was trying to go to the bathroom?!
No! But because he thought I was to faaaaa.... And every time I think about it, it makes me feel as bad as I did in fifth grade! Y'know, I-I really think that you should apologize to Julie.
What? Are you kidding? That was like 16 years ago.
No, I know. But y'know what? It would make me feel better if Lewis apologized to me.
Okay, I will do it. But I have to warn you; this may make me a better person and that is not the man you feel in love with!
Okay, all right, this is how it's going to work. We're gonna give you hypothetical maid of honor situations and you will be scored on a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the highest.
No, 10 is the highest.
Why is 10 the highest?
Because It's The Highest. Situation No.1 You're with Monica, the wedding is about to start when Monica gets cold feet. Go!
I don't want to marry Chandler!
Okay, uh...
I've got cold feet.
...it's gonna be okay!
No, one man for the rest of my life? I don't know if I can do it! This means I'll never get to sleep with Joey!
Look Monica, getting cold feet is very common. Y'know, it's-it's just because of all the anticipation and you just have to remember that you love Chandler. And also, I ran out on a wedding. You don't get to keep the gifts.
Very good! Drawing on your own experience, I like that!
Thanks!
Yes, very nice Rachel.
Thank you judges.
Ugh, what a kiss ass.
Oh!
Okay, Phoebe...
Yes! Your honor?
We're now in the ceremony, Monica is about to say, "I do" when her drunk uncle starts yelling. What do you do? Go!
When Monica was a little girl, I remember that--Ooh!! Ow! Very good!
Oh!
Yes! Excellent! Perfect score!
Wait a minute! She just made a scene in the middle of the ceremony!
Hey! Do you want do you want a little taste of Pheebs?!
It is time for you to give your maid of honor speech.
Ohh, wait a minute, we haven't pre...
Go!
Okay! Okay! Umm, Webster's Dictionary defines marriage as... Okay!! Forget that! That sucks!! Okay, never mind! Forget it! Umm, umm, okay, uh... I met, I-I met, I met Monica when we were just a couple of six year olds and I became friends with Chandler when he was 25, although he seemed like a six year old.
Oh! That's nice.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Umm, I've known them separately and I've known them together and-and to know them as a couple is to know that you are truly in the presence of love. So I would like to raise my glass to Monica and Chandler and the beautiful adventure they are about to embark upon together. I can think of no two people better prepared for the journey.
Wow. Good speech.
Yeah, it really was!
Aw, thanks!
Okay Phoebe, I guess you're next although I really don't see the point.
Yeah.
Okay, I can't believe that Monica and Chandler are getting married. I remember talking about this day with Rachel while we were showering together, naked.
And she's back in the game.
Julie hi! Chandler Bing, I, I guess you remember me.
Hello Skidmark.
It's a nickname, I'll explain later.
It's pretty clear.
Ah, uh, I owe you a long overdue apology. I never should have broken up with you because you were overweight.
That's why you broke up with me?
You-you-you didn't know that. Well, I guess my work here is done!
All right, well first of all I would like to say that you both performed very well. Okay? You should be proud of yourselves. And-and I would also like to say that in this competition there are no losers. Well, except for Rachel-Damnit!
Really?! I won!
What?!
I'm sorry Rach, it was, it was really close.
Well then I demand a recount!
Actually, it wasn't that close.
No! Y'know what? No! No! You thing was so stupid anyway, this was ridiculous-We're gonna flip a coin! All right?! Heads!
The coins have finally forgiven me!
Well y'know what? I hope Monica forgives you after you throw her, her vegetarian, voodoo, goddess circley shower!
Rach, it's gonna be okay! You guys are the best!
Boy I tell ya, that judging stuff took a lot out of me.
Yeah?
Yeah! I was thinking about maybe going upstairs and taking a little nap on my couch.
Why-why would I care about that?
No reason, I'm just saying that uh... That's where I'll be.
As bad as that went I actually enjoyed myself. I think that I'm going to apologize for all of the stupid things I do.
Why don't you just stop doing stupid things? Then you wouldn't have to apologize.
I would really love it if could do both.
All right, I...I have to ask.
What?
Are you gonna break up with me if I get fat again?
What?!
Well, you broke up with Julie Grath! How much weight could she have gained?
A hundred and forty-five pounds.
In one year?! My God what did she eat? Her-her family! That's not the point.
Look I know it was a stupid reason to break up with somebody, but I was 15!
Well... That's not the only time this was an issue. You remember when umm, you spent Thanksgiving with us? You called me fat.
Okay. Okay, now wait a minute that was totally different.
How?
You were not supposed to hear that! I said that behind you back!
What if I have babies, okay? I mean I'm gonna look different. I'm okay with that, but I'm not sure that you are!
Look you have to realize I don't think of you as a thin, beautiful woman. See this is one of things that I can apologize for later! Look, what I mean is you're Monica! Okay? And I am in love with Monica.
Keep going.
So you can balloon up or you can shrink down and I will still love you.
Even if I shrink down to two inches tall?
I'd carry you around in my pocket.
I love you.
Skidmark's still got a way with the ladies.
Hi Pheebs.
Hi!
Hi! I just want to apologize. I'm really sorry I was a baby.
That's ridiculous Rachel, we were all babies once. Oh, you mean today.
Yeah. Yeah, and y'know you-you deserve to win. And-and y'know I was thinking about it, if-if you're Monica's maid of honor that means I get to be yours.
Oh yeah!
Yeah! Oh, umm when-when Monica and Chandler got engaged I started putting some stuff together, y'know just in case...
Oh that's so sweet thanks.
Here is a book of poetry that I know Monica loves. And-and ohh God this is funny, look, this is a picture of one Halloween where she dressed up as a bride. And look, she made me carry her train, which was weird because I was Wonder Woman. Oh and here's a little purse that I found. Y'know I just thought that maybe they could hold the rings in there.
Ohh.
And umm, vintage handkerchiefs y'know 'cause, people cry at weddings. I'm just gonna grab a couple of these.
This stuff is great!
Oh, I forgot this was in here. Umm, this was the uh garter that I was saving for my wedding and I wanted it to be Monica's something borrowed and it's blue. Yeah...
Y'know Rach, I think that, I think you should be Monica's made of honor.
You do? Why?
Because I think it means more to you.
But Pheebs, y'know you earned it.
Its fine. I mean, this is something that you've been thinking about since you were what, 14?
No, I was ten. I just developed early.
Man alive!
Hey, what's going on?
Hey!
Well, we just decided that Rachel is gonna be your maid of honor.
Ohh, wow! That's great! Oh wow! We really have to start planning! I have, I have a lot of really specific ideas! We should probably get together like four times per week. You can come over to my place; we'll get together before work! What do you say, 6:30, my place? I'm so excited!
Yeah okay, you laugh now, but she's gonna be yours.
Great nap.
It really was.
Dude! What the hell are you doing?! God!
Excuse me.
Morning!
Hi! Oh, how was your date last night?
Pretty good.
Oh good. Ahhh! My God, sorry!
Okay, really good. Anyway I gotta go; I'm late for work.
What-what?! You're gonna leave this person with me?!
Yeah-Hey, don't worry, she's a terrific girl. And hey listen, could you do me a favor? When she comes out could you just mention that I'm not looking for a serious relationship; that'd be great.
Why?! What?! Are you kidding?!
Just casually slip it in, y'know lay the groundwork. Tell her uh, I'm a loner-No! An outlaw! Tell her she doesn't want to get mixed up with the likes of me.
Y'know what? That's a lot to remember, can't I just tell her you're a pig?
Hey, I'm gonna call her later! Honest! Oh come on, Chandler used to do it! He'd even make the girl pancakes! Plus, he'd make extras and leave 'em for me.
Well forget it, I'm not telling that girl anything. That is not my responsibility.
Fine! Now, where'd we land on those pancakes?
Hi!
Hi.
Sorry about that, but I couldn't get that lock to work on the door.
Yeah, Joey kinda disabled it when I moved in.
You must be Rachel, I'm Erin.
Hi.
Hi. I don't mean this to sound like high school, but did he say anything about me?
Would you like some pancakes?
...Come on! Why are we here?!
Okay, okay take a guess.
The hot chicks?
Okay, okay, I was typing names into the library computer earlier, y'know-y'know for fun, and I typed mine in and guess what came up? My doctoral dissertation! It's here! Yeah, it's right-it's right down here! In the biggest library in the university!
Wow that's actually pretty cool.
Oh umm, there's also a book here by a woman named Wendy Bagina. What is that?
Sounds like two people are really enjoying the Dewey decimal system.
I'm so sorry!
Sorry!
You didn't bring me here to do that, did you?
She sent the chicken back again?!
She says it's to dry now and she wants to come back here and explain to you exactly how she wants it.
Well fine! I want to meet this chicken expert! Send the Colonel in!
OH...MY...GAWD!!!!
Lucky bastard! Janice.
How are you Ms. Hot Shot chef with the big fancy restaurant with the best chicken ever!
I'm fine.
Ohh! What is that on your finger?! I'm blind!
Oh... Uh...
So, who's the lucky guy?
OH...MY...GAWD! I am so sorry sweetie, are you okay? You didn't tell her we were getting married, did you?
Well, she saw the ring.
Did she freak out?
Well, she was shocked when I told her, but then again so were most people.
Right.
Well, she actually has a boyfriend y'know herself, named Clark. Uh, she also kinda invited herself to our wedding. Clark too.
You said no right?
Huh?
You said no right?!
Well, she corned me! She asked if the wedding was in town! I mean, what was I supposed to do?!
Lie!!! How hard is that?! The check's in the mail! Oh your baby is so cute! I can't wait to read your book Ross!!
Come on! So she comes to the wedding! I mean it won't be so bad.
What do you think she's just gonna sit there quietly? You don't think she's gonna want to make a toast? You don't think she's gonna want to grab the microphone and sing Part-time Lover?!
Oh my God, she's not gonna like the chicken that night either is she?!
Y'know what? It's gonna be okay. Y'know what? She's probably not gonna even want to come.
Really?
No! That was a lie! See how easy that was?
So-so you would've just lied?
Yes!!
Would it really have been that easy?
Yes!!!
Good, so do it Saturday night because we're going to dinner with her and Clark.
Hey! What's up?
Hey!
Hey-hey, who's your friend? Hey!!
Hey Joey!
Erin! Still here!
Yeah, we ended up spending the day together and had such a great time!
Why wouldn't ya? Erin is great! Then-then there's you guys.
Ohh, listen. I've got to get going. Today was great, thanks!
I know!
Okay!
Bye Joey. Last night was fun.
Yeah. I'll uh, I'll call ya.
Oh and I'll call ya too!
Or I'll call you!
And call me!
Okay, good to see you again.
Bye.
Bye-bye.
Bye!
So, system kinda broke down huh?!
Oh Joey, I'm sorry I just couldn't tell her all those things you wanted me to tell her. And y'know we got to talking and I...
We want you to marry her!
What?!!
She is so amazing! You have no idea.
No idea? Who do you think brought her here?
Cupid.
Joey, she's so cool. She speaks four languages.
Man, do you know what guys want!
Look Joey, come on she's so perfect for you! I mean she's sweet, she-she likes baseball, and she-she had two beers at lunch.
My beers?! Look you guys, she's a very nice girl. Okay? We had a good time, but I just-I don't see it going anywhere.
Yeah, but you always say that.
Yeah, maybe if you gave this girl a chance it would go somewhere.
Look I'm sorry you guys, I-I just don't think so.
Whatever.
Fine.
Hey, don't start judging me! Huh? You're the one who's in love with her assistant! Huh? And you, you're the one having the affair with the guy who keeps the pigeons on the roof!
Phoebe!
Secret affair!
People are doing it in front of my book!
I'm sorry?
My doctoral dissertation is in the library at school, I went to see it, and there were students makin' babies right in the middle of the Paleontology section!
Oh my God! Did you get to see anything good?
Let me ask you something, at your school was there a like uh a place on campus where students went to uh, fool around.
Yeah, there was. It was-there the corner of the library where-where all these dusty books that nobody ever read-Yes, there was.
Great! Because people kept showing up, I think it's like uh-a thing!
Now hold on a second, fifth floor against that back wall?
Oh for cryin' out loud!
All right, so we should go catch our movie.
Well now what's the rush?
I like to see the previews. The candy.
Oh. Hey!
Well look who's here!
Hey!
Hey!
Joey.
Erin.
Hey Rachel.
Hi! Well, we were just about to take off and see a movie. Oh no!
What's wrong?
Oh Phoebe, we forgot that party we have to go to.
Oh no.
What party?
A birthday party.
Who's birthday party?
Allison's birthday party.
Oh, and how is Allison?
32.
Wait a minute! Why don't you guys do something?!
Yeah, look how that worked out.
Excuse me. Hi, I'm a professor here. Do you know the Paleontology section, fifth floor, stack 437?
Well, yes! Just give me five minutes, I just have to find someone to cover my shift.
No! No!! No! Can I speak to someone in charge please?!
How can I help you?
Hi, I was wondering if it is possible to increase security in the Paleontology section? See I-I wrote a book up there and instead of reading it people are-are-are well, rolling around in front of it.
We are aware of the problem you are referring too. But as far as increasing security, I'm afraid the library is very understaffed. I, I can't help you.
Well, fine. Fine! If-if I'm the only person with any appreciation of the sanctity of the written word, I'll go up there and defend it myself! And don't you follow me!
Hey.
Hey!
How did it go with Erin?
Oh, unbelievable! We had the best time!
Yay!! Oh so, you're not, you're not mad at us anymore?
No! No! No! You guys were totally right! This is so much better than the first time we went out. Y'know? That was so awkward, we were really nervous.
Didn't you sleep together?
Yeah that really calms me down. And! We have so much in common! She loves sandwiches, sports, although she is a Met fan, not much of an issue now but if were ever to have kids, well that's a...
Oh my God! Listen to you talkin' about having kids. Oh my Joey. Oh, please don't get married before I do.
Okay.
Oh. Oh I just cannot believe Clark stood me up!
He might still show up.
Oh, what are you, stupid? It's been three hours.
Is that all?
I should just go on to happier things, okay? Umm, why don't you tell about your lovely wedding?
Well actually uh, there was something we wanted to tell you about the wedding. Um, it's going to be a small ceremony. Uh, tiny! We're not even sure why we're having it.
It's actually going to be just family.
Oh...wait...you two think of me as family?! Oh, I have to ask you something now and be honest; do you want me to sing Careless Whisper or Lady In Red?
How can you say that?! The Mets have no closer!
What about Benitez?
What about Game 1 of the Series?
What about shut up?
You shut up! I love arguing with her. I'll be right back.
Okay.
So how's it goin' with Joey?
Uh, okay.
Okay? Wait okay, tell-tell me that you like him, please? I mean tell me that you like him.
Look, he's a really great guy and I know that you really want this to work out, but I just don't see this having a future.
But you said that you liked him! I mean what happened?! Did ya just change your mind?!
Kinda.
Then change it back!
I'm sorry I... It's just there's no real spark.
No spark? Didn't you sleep together?
Yeah.
Ugh, tramp!
Does Joey have any idea?
I really don't think he does. And y'know what? Maybe you guys could help clue him in. Y'know, tell him I'm-I'm not interested in a serious relationship or something.
Yeah, you mean like that you're kind of a loner.
Yeah! That would be great!
Yeah, and maybe that you're a real
I'm sorry?
Oh well, I guess Italian isn't one of the four languages you speak.
Hey! You wanna go?
Yeah, let's go.
Okay. See you guys later.
Bye guys.
Yeah, see ya.
Hey, thank you so much.
Wow. Well, I guess it was Cupid who brought her here.
No, just a regular old flying dwarf.
Yes? Yes?! How can I help you?
Yeah, we were...we were just looking around.
Oh-oh, you're-you're fellow scholars. What exactly were you looking for, hmm? Perhaps, perhaps Dr. Chester Stock's musings on the Smiledon Californicus?
Uhh....
Ah... Ah...Get out of here! Uh, meeting someone? Or-or are you just here to brush up on Marion's views on evolution?
Uh, actually I find Marion's views far to progressionist.
I find Marion's views far to progressionist.
I'm sorry, who are you?
I'm a professor here uh, Ross...Geller.
Ross Geller, why do I know that name? It's uh-Wait! Did you write this?
Yes! You're the person who checked out my book?!
Y'know, you look nothing like I would've thought. You're...you're so young.
Well I uh, I skipped forth grade.
I am very...very sorry.
Hey!
Hey!
Hi!
So how was, how was your date?
Oh, it was great! I mean we walked all around the village. We went to this ice cream place, split a milkshake, 70/30 but still... And guess what, I'm thinking about taking her upstate to one of those bed and breakfasts.
Oh really? She said she wants to go away with you?
No-no-no-no-no! It's a surprise, but it's gonna be tricky thought because she said she was gonna be pretty busy at work for a while.
Oh no, yeah.
Jo-Joey, look honey we-we need to talk okay? Umm, I kinda got the feeling from her today that uh, she's not lookin' for a serious relationship.
Where are you gettin' this?
Well, she told me. She said she's kinda a loner.
Oh. Oh.
Joey...
No hey Rach, it's cool okay? Y'know I'm a loner too! Right?
Hey Joey, y'know what? You are way to good for her.
Yeah and honey I promise next time that I will just say good-bye and tell 'em you're not looking for a relationship.
No! No. Don't do that, just next time make sure she really likes me.
Well that too. Joey?
Yeah?
Do you want some pancakes?
Finally!
What are we gonna do?
I say we go with Careless Whisper.
Chandler?
Did she see us yet? Did she see us?
Janice, what umm, what are you doing here?
Well umm, I thought I was going to go back to my apartment but then I just felt I couldn't really be alone tonight. I was wondering if I could maybe stay here with you, just I really feel that I need to be with family.
Our kids are gonna call her Aunt Janice aren't they?
Please, it's because otherwise I really don't know what I might do.
Aren't you just a tinsy bit curious?
Do you have any tissues?
Yeah, in-in-in the bathroom.
Okay!
We'll just...we'll just let her stay.
No-no-no-no, if we let her stay, she will stay forever!
Kinda like your Barca lounger.
Is that what you're thinking about right now?
I never stop thinking about it.
Hey you guys, umm do either one of you want to get in there before I take my bath.
Janice, I'm sorry but umm, you can't stay here tonight.
Why not?
Honestly? Our apartment is a hotbed for electromagnetic activity. Now Monica and I have been immunized, but sadly you have not.
Okay, I'm going to need a comforter, but did you have a hypoallergenic one because otherwise I get very nasal. Do you have a cat? 'Cause it's already happening. Do you hear that?
Oh my God! Oh my God! You have to go!
Why?
Because Chandler still has feelings for you!
He does?
Say again?
That's right. That's right. And that is why you can't stay here tonight. And probably why you shouldn't come to the wedding.
Feelings, such strong feelings.
I mean, I realize that his feelings may never completely go away, but you can.
Oh...my Gawd, I-I understand. I-I am so sorry, I'll go. Good-bye Monica , I wish you a lifetime of happiness with him. Chandler, you call me when this goes in the pooper.
Don't sweat it, I've got this section covered. Yeah, in fact I've got this little baby to shine in people's eye--Okay, see you later.
I just wanted to show Monica your book.
Hey everybody! Happy Thanksgiving!
No, no, no. No-no-no.
Shhhh!
What, are we keeping Thanksgiving a secret this year?
No, we're playing this game I learned at work. You have to name all the states in six minutes.
What? That's like insanely easy!
Now, that's a lot harder than it sounds. You always forget at least one, or in some cases... fourteen .
It's a stupid game and I wasn't playing against other people, so technically I didn't lose.
What? You forgot fourteen states?
Nobody cares about the Dakotas.
Oh, okay, time's up!
All right, I got 48.
Oh that's not bad, Pheebs?
Oh, I Got Tired Of Naming States. So I Decided To List The Types Of Celery, And I Have One regular celery.
Okay, so Rachel's got 48 and Phoebe has the lead in...vegetables, Joey?
Say hello to the new champ of Chandler's dumb states game.
Wow, how many have you got?
Fifty-six!
Hey! How is New England not a state? Huh? They have a sports-team!
Does South Oregon have a sports-team? There you go.
How come we have one extra place setting?
'Cause you invited your assistant.
Oh, right. Sorry. But Tag's not coming; his girlfriend came into town, so he's spending Thanksgiving with her.
Oh! Why didn't you tell me? I made him his own individual sweet potato stuffed pumpkin.
Well, I was going to, but then I figured, you know... you're food is so delicious and perfect, you can never have too many of those pumpkin things.
Now you think I wouldn't enjoy that, because it is so fake, but I still do.
Regular Celery! Oh, I already have that.
Done! With time a-to-spare.
Oooh that may be a New World's record
You know, I hate to lecture you guys, but it's kinda disgraceful, that a group of well-educated adults and Joey can't name all the states. Did you ever see a map, or one of those round, colorful things called "a globe?" Hmm?
Uh, Magellan? You got 46 states.
What? That's impossible.
46. Wow! Who's well educated now, Mr. I-forgot-ten-states?
All right, I'm out of oven space. I'm gonna turn on Joey's. Please, watch him! Do not let Joey eat any of the food!
I am only one man! Okay Ross, time is up!
No, just give me another minute.
Look Ross, if you don't know them by now, you will never know them, okay? That is the beauty of this game. It makes you want to kill yourself.
This-this is crazy! I can do this! All right, uhh, I bet I can get all 50 before dinner.
Okay, but if you can't...no dinner!
You're on!
All right. Don't look at my list, Ross, 'cause there's a lot on there that you don't have.
Hey, did you guys know, that your oven doesn't work?
But the drawer full of take-out menus is okay, right?
Ross, I'm gonna use yours, okay?
Pshhshhh!
Chandler? Can you give me a hand?
Sure, and Joey; do not let Ross look at any of the maps or the globe in your apartment.
Don't worry, Chandler, it's not a globe of the United States.
Hey you guys I'm gonna go out and take a walk.
Phoebe, why is your bag moving?
Oh, it's not!
Seriously, it's moving!
What the hell is in there?
It's just my knitting that's all! Yes! I knit this. I'm very good.
Ross's apartment is nice! How come we don't hang out here more often?
I don't know. Maybe it's because it smells a little weird. It's like old pumpkins or something.
That's my pie!
Which smells delicious!
Uh-oh! Uh-oh!
What?
We left Joey alone with the food! Yep! Yep, I knew it! There he is... feeding stuffing to a dog!
Hi Geller-Bing residence. How can I help?
Phoebe, why is there a dog in our apartment?
I'm sorry, who's this?
Phoebe, there's a dog sitting on my couch!
Tell her, I'm allergic, and I will sue!
No, there's no dog here?
Yes there is! He's black and white and shaggy and he's sitting next to Rachel and licking Rachel's hand.
Oh my god! Where are you?
I'll be right there!
They're here already? How are they doing this?
Hi Tag! What are you doing here?
I, uh, wanted to see if your offer to spend Thanksgiving with you is still good.
Well, sure! Come in! Well, what-what happened to your girlfriend?
We kinda broke up this morning.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Yeah, so she went back to Ohio.
Ohio!! Thank you!
Huh! Where is the dog?!
What dog? There-there's no dog here.
Yeah that dog left!
Phoebe! Phoebe, open up!
There's no dog in here.
Phoebe, we can hear the dog barking!
No that's just me coughing! Oh, good, there you are! Listen, um, I have a dog in my room.
What is it doing here?
Well, I'm watching it for some friends who went out of town. Wait. Hello, my name is Clunkers. May I please stay with you nice people?
Oooh, I wish she could stay here, but Chandler is allergic!
Extremely allergic, okay? If I'm anywhere near a dog for more than 5 minutes, my throat will just close up!
That's odd, 'cause this dog's been living here for the past 3 days
Really?
Chandler, if that dog's been here that long, and you haven't had a reaction, maybe you're not allergic to this dog?
Well, it still has to go, right?
Why?
Okay, it's um...
Don't do it!
Don't do what?
I have to! Okay? It's time! Okay, I hate dogs.
What?
Are you crazy?
Are you out of your mind?
Why?
Told ya.
They are needy, they are jumpy, and you can't tell what they are thinking, and that scares me a little bit.
Right, they are scary. Ahh, she just ate a treat out of my hand!!!
Wait a minute. Do you not like all dogs? I mean, not even puppies?
Is there a puppy here?
You don't like puppies?
Okay, you are new!
Look, Chandler, I told you, never tell anyone about this dog thing. It's like Ross not likin' ice cream.
You don't like ice cream?
It's too cold.
Okay, it's just that dogs make me a little uncomfortable.
It hurts my teeth.
And I don't wanna say this, I don't you guys to hate me, but uh, I don't think, I can be around that dog anymore. Okay, so either the dog goes, or I go. Oh my god!!
How can I not get this? I'm a college professor; I got 1450 on my S.A.T.s.
1250.
Damn, I forgot you were here.
All right. We're gonna take Clunkers to Ross's. We'll be back in a minute.
Oh, wait before you guys go, can I just ask you a question?
Yeah.
When a guy breaks up with his girlfriend, what is an appropriate amount of time to wait before you make a move?
Oh, I'd say about a month.
Really? I'd say 3 to 4.
Half hour.
Interesting.
When it's your assistant, I would say never.
All right, Rach, the big question is, does he like you? All right? Because if he doesn't like you, this is all a moo-point.
Huh. A moo-point?
Yeah, it's like a cow's opinion. It just doesn't matter. It's moo.
Have I been living with him for too long, or did that all just make sense?
Please, don't listen to Joey, okay. Would you look at him? He-he's obviously depressed. He's away from his family; he's spending Thanksgiving with strangers. What he needs right now is for you to be his friend.
You're right, I'm sorry. Thank you. Okay, that's what I'm gonna do.
Fine! Take their advice. No one ever listens to me. When the package is this pretty, no one cares what's inside.
Hey!
Hey.
How are you holding up?
Not bad.
Yeah? I'm sorry about your girlfriend.
Thanks.
So were you guys together a long time?
A year. On and off. I kinda thought we'd end up together. I don't anymore.
Now that she broke up with you?
Yeah.
Yeah. Hmmmm.
It's weird. I always used to assume, that I would meet someone and fall in love and be happy and all that was just a given. But lately it's like what if it's not. Do you ever have that feeling?
No...Yeah, all the time, constantly. It's terrifying. But you know that I figure it...it has to work out.
Why?
Because, uh-it has to.
You have all the answers, don't you?
Yeah, I know, I do. I really do.
Hey, thanks for talking to me.
Well, what is a boss for? Hug it out!
All right, he likes you back! Huh? Told ya, you should go for it!
What?
Street noise drowned any of that out? No, all right, I see you later, okay...
What did Joey say? I like you back?
Uh, yeah, well, see, he... Joey knows, that I'm-I'm very insecure about my back and, and...you're hugging me, so obviously you are not repulsed by it, yeah!
Wait-wait a minute; that doesn't make any sense.
No? All right, here's the truth um, Joey said what he said, because um, I'm attracted to you.
Wow.
Yeah, I admit it. I have a crush on you, and uh, and, and I know that's crazy because we work together, and-and nothing could ever happen, and the last thing I want to do is-is to freak you out or make you feel uncomfortable. Which is why it would be really great if you said something right about now.
Oh my god! Those guys are stealing my car!
What?
Right there! That's my car! Hey!!
Okay, that's gonna take them a minute. Do you have anything else you wanna get off your chest?
I can't believe this!
Wait, we still have time to talk and they're-they're not even in the car yet! Oh look, there they go, okay.
Okay Phoebe, we should probably go back now.
Please don't leave me, I'll be lonely.
Stop it. Stop! Okay let's go. We can be strong.
Yeah, okay.
Oh my god! Did you hear that? She said Monica! Oooh, I can't leave her!
You know if you want, we can sneak the dog back in and Chandler wouldn't even know.
That's not gonna work.
I've had that dog there for three days and Chandler had no idea. He's not so smart.
Hey! I didn't know either.
Yeah, but you kinda knew that something was going on, didn't you?
Yeah, I knew.
Where's Chandler?
Here I am.
Wash your hands!!!
How did you...know?
Hey! What's she doing back here?
Relax, Ross. She's not made of ice cream!
Hey look, Phoebe. I, uh, I laid out the states geographically...
No, no, we don't really have time for this right now. Okay, we have to keep Chandler away from my bedroom.
Yeah, but, but look what I'm...
See, this is exactly what we do not have time for.
Where's Monica?
Um, in Phoebe's room. You can't go in there.
Why not?
Monica's crying. She's very upset about this whole Clunkers thing.
Well, I, I should go in there.
No. No, no. She doesn't want to see you right now.
Why not?
Because you sent away the dog!
This is ridiculous.
Oh, is it? Is it? Look, when Monica and I were kids, we had a dog named Rover. And, uh, one day, my dad decides, he doesn't like dogs. So Monica and her friend...Phyllis...take away the dog. And that was the last time we ever saw him. Don't you see? This is just like that. Only with a few details changed.
Okay, I'm in my sweat pants. Bring on the food! What's the matter?
Monica's all upset, because I sent Clunkers away.
So? Bring the dog back, you're a hero.
Yeah, I can be a hero, I could do that. I could, I could do... I, w-w-what if, what if it attacks me?
Chandler, it's like a big gerbil.
And that doesn't scare you?
Ross, you need some help?
From you? Yes, please!
First of all, Utah? Dude, you can't just make stuff up!
I hate America! When I finish this game, I swear I am moving.
Hey! Tag's still talking to the police.
Yeah, ohh! Why, damnit, why did I open my mouth? I have a crush on you; I am attracted to you. Gee, I-I know that I freaked him out
If you said it like that, you probably did, yeah.
Hey, is Chandler here?
No, no he went for a walk.
Okay, but you cannot tell him... but look whose back!
Hi!
Oh No-no-no-no-no-no-no! He went over to Ross' to bring the dog back here!
Oh no, the dog's not going to be there!
You think?
Hi, honey.
Please, please, please, don't be mad at me.
What? Why, why would...
Shh, wait and see. Maybe we will, maybe we won't.
Okay, I went over to Ross' apartment to bring back Clunkers. Y'know, for you, and... I left the door open and she must have gotten out and I looked everywhere, all over the apartment, including the roof, which FYI Ross, one of your neighbors, growing weed. I couldn't find him, and I am so, so, so, sorry. But I do know where we could all go ease the pain.
We have good news, look whose back!
Hi!
Clunkers?! Oh my god!
That's right, she came back all by herself.
It's a Thanksgiving miracle!
It is so good to see you!
Yeah, she came all the way back from Ross' building. Oh, the things she must have seen! And then she climbed up the fire escape and she tapped on the window with her teeny little paw and then we ran to let her in... I went to far, didn't I? When should I have stopped?
Okay, maybe this is so hard, because there aren't 50 states. Let me tell you something, I have 49 states, and there are no more! I-I think, I should be able to eat something.
It's up to you.
Oh, hi! How are you doing?
I'm okay. I gotta go down to the police station and look at mug shots.
Oh.
Thanks for having me over, you guys.
Tag? Y-You're going? Uh we didn't, uh we didn't get the chance to talk. Uh, so, where did you say you're from again?
Colorado.
Ah, what good are you.
Look, um, I think we should talk about what happened on the terrace.
Okay.
Ah, I-I never should have said what I said. It-y'know what? It just doesn't matter how I feel. I mean we work together, so nothing could really ever happen between us, and what I would love is just to go to work on Monday, and-and never talk about this again, okay? Big day Monday lots to do. So, we're okay?
Um, I'm not.
Oh, god, I know it, that I freaked you out.
No, you didn't. The only thing that freaked me out was you saying that nothing could ever happen between us.
Really?
Yeah, so, please don't fire me for doing this.
Okay, well, that's one less thing we have to do on Monday.
Delaware! Delaware!
All right.
I want my turkey now!
You got it. You got Nevada twice.
I know.
Yeah.
I'm ready!
You sure?
Uh-huh!
Okay, let me just straighten out your helmet there.
Thanks daddy.
No-no, one daddy, two mommies. All right, it's all yours.
Okay. Okay.
Yes! Yes! Yes!!
His first big kid's bike, this is so exciting!
Oh yeah, I remember mine! Ohh, it was my sixth birthday, my dad took me to the park, I got it, and...it bent.
Yeah.
I never had a bike of my own.
What?!
Well, we didn't have a lot of money. But the girl across the street had the best bike! It was pink and it had rainbow colored tassels hanging off the handle grips, and-and-and a bell and this big, white wicker basket with those plastic daisies stuck on.
That sounds like my first bike. My dad gave me his old one.
Ohh.
Did the girl ever let you ride it?
No! But she gave me the box that it came in. It had a picture of the bike on the front. So I would sit on it and my step-dad would drag me around the backyard.
That is so unfair!
Not really, I got to drag him around too!
Hey! What are you guys doing?
Hey.
Making holiday candy for the neighbors.
I'm sorry, who?
I'm gonna hang this basket on the door and when the neighbors walk by they can all take a piece.
But we don't know the neighbors.
I do. There's uh, let's see, Guy With a Mustache, Smokes-A-Lot Lady, Some Kids I've Seen, and A Red-haired Guy Who Does Not Like To Be Called Rusty.
See? This is exactly why I'm making this candy. We can learn their names and get to know our neighbors.
Wouldn't it be easier if we just moved?
Gooood morning!!
Eh, somebody's in a good mood!
Well, why shouldn't I be? I have great friends! I have a wonderful job!
Where you can make out with your assistant.
Come on, it's not a big deal! We stayed up all night coming up with a plan so that us dating will not be a problem.
Oh yeah, what's the plan?
We... We are not... ...going to let it... be a problem.
Wow! It took you all night to come up with that plan?!
Well y'know, we did other stuff too.
Did you two...
Oh Monica come on, y'know I don't sleep with guys on the first date!
Matt Guire, Mark Lynn, Ben Wire...
Anymore!!
Okay.
Hi. Tag, I have a conference call today is that correct?
Yes, at 4:00.
Okay, thank you. That'll be all. Wait! Wait! Did you see that? That mail guy had no idea there was something going on between us.
I'd better get back to my desk.
Okay, you hard worker! I'll remember to put that in your evaluation.
My what?
Well, you've been here for two months now and your boss is required to hand in a performance evaluation. But y'know, there is one thing that I have yet to evaluate.
Are you serious?
No, I've just always wanted to do that. Can you help me clean this up?
The basket is totally empty! My God, the neighbors ate all the candy!
Well, either that or uh...
Joey!!
Yeah?
Did you eat all the neighbor candy?!
Uh well yeah, that was the plan, but by the time I got to it there was only a couple of pieces left!
Yeah, and they've been coming by all day. They love it!
They love my candy? Oh man!!! I've gotta go make more!!
Hey Mon, you might wanna make some more lasagna too, because something might've happened to a huge chunk of it.
Ross! The neighbors ate all my candy!!
Mine stole my newspaper! It's like a crime wave!! Pheebs, you uh, you got a second.
Sure!
Yeah, ever since you uh, told me that story about that bike I-I couldn't stop thinking about it. I mean, everyone should have a-a first bike, so...
Oh my God Ross!!
You like it?
I love it!!
Yeah?
Ohh!! Ohh!! And I love you!
Ahh.
Not that way! But the bike brought you a lot closer!
Ah! Well uh-uh, t-take it downstairs, y'know give it a test ride.
Okay! Oh my God! My first bike! Thank you for the best present I've ever gotten.
You're welcome.
Oh and Chandler's about to cry.
Am not!
Who is that?!
Don't worry, I'm brave! I am brave! I...I am brave! No-no-no-no!! Can you tell me who is there please?
My name is Gary, I live upstairs.
Hi!
Hi. Do you know what time it is?
It's candy time! My roommate says that they taste like little drops of heaven.
Oh please! Did you hear that? Little drops of heaven.
4:00 A.M.
So, can I get some candy?
I am sorry, but some of us have to get up early and go to work! He does not know that I am not some of us.
Umm, listen I am sorry, but I'll put some out first thing in the morning.
Well okay, I'll swing by later. Do you live in this building?
Um-hmm.
Mm! Seems like I would've remembered you!
Mm! Night Gar'!
So did you read your evaluation yet?
No! It was marked confidential I just sent it down to Human Resources.
Okay please, you're kidding right?! I wrote that one as a joke for you!
A joke they would appreciate?
I'm thinkin' no.
What did you say?!
Umm, I said I thought you were a good kisser, and uh, and that I like your tiney-tiny touchie.
No, not my touchie.
Well, it gets worse. When asked if you take initiative I wrote, "Yes, he was able to unhook my bra with minimal supervision," and under Problems with Performance I wrote, "Dear God, I hope not," and then uh, then I drew a little smiley face, and then a small pornographic sketch.
Ross! That is so sweet of you to get Phoebe that bike! When I heard the story, I almost cried.
Almost cried huh? Hear that Chandler? Almost cried!
Hey, you cry every time somebody talks about Titanic!
Those two only had each other!
Phoebe really likes the bike huh?
Oh yeah! I saw her walkin' it down the street the other day. She had uh, these flowers in the basket. It was so cute.
Yeah, I saw her this morning walkin' it by the park.
Wait a minute, she was walking the bike? Both times?
Hey Pheebs?
Oh hi!
Hey! So are you enjoying the bike?
Ohh, uh-huh so much!
Pheebs you uh...you do know how to ride a bike don't you?
Of course!
Umm, can we see you ride it?
Okay. See?
See, this is why I told you never get involved with your assistant! And here is no such thing as keeping secrets when it comes to affairs. Did you hear that Chandler? No such thing!
What happened? I'm just eating candy.
Maybe it's not as bad as I think. Y'know, maybe they didn't take it the way I meant it.
Absolutely! Y'know, because touchie can mean both ass and good worker.
Ugh, I just gotta get the thing back!
Hey Rach?
Yeah?
That sketch you mentioned? Might it have looked a little something like this?
Oh my God! Joey!
What is the matter with you?
Ugh!
Boy I tell ya, this little talent came in handy before I could afford porn.
Hi! I'm sorry, I know it's after hours but I really need candy.
I'm sorry, I can't help you. See? Rules are rules.
Please! I have people coming from out of town today! And, I told them all about your candy!
No kidding, out of towners huh? What did you tell 'em?
I told 'em your candy is absolutely indescribable!
Some people have been saying its y'know little drops of heaven, but whatever.
Please, can't you help me out?
Hey Chandler, do we know that lady?
Maybe, isn't she the woman who lives below you and has sex really loud?
All right, I'll do it just this once! But you can't tell anybody!
Yes! Yes! Please, just give it to me!
Yeah, that's her.
Thank you.
It's unbelievable! I-I can't believe that sign didn't work!
Y'know what would work?
Hmm?
Stop making candy!
But they like it!
You mean they like you.
Maybe.
Is that why you became a chef? So that people would like you?
Oh, you really want to talk about getting people to like you huh, funny man?
Okay, now just remember everything I taught you and you'll be fine. Okay? Here we go. Ready...Set...
Wait! This seat is really uncomfortable! Yeah, maybe before we start we should just get another one. Perhaps, like an airplane seat-or a beanbag chair!
Phoebe, you can't get out of this! Okay? You have to learn how to ride a bike!
Why? Why do I have to learn?
Well...In-in case of emergency.
What kind of an emergency?
Well let there-what if a man comes along and puts a gun to your head and says, "You ride this bike or I'll sh...I'll shoot you."
Okay, I would ring the bell to distract him and then I would knock the gun out of his hand with a Chinese throwing star.
Okay, Phoebe just-just get-get on the bike and-Hey! I'll hold you up and-and push you. Okay?
You won't let go?
No!
Swear?!
I swear!
Okay.
Come on. All right, here we go. All right?
All right.
All right. Feel good?
Well...
All right, try pedaling.
Okay.
That's it, your doing great.
Okay.
Doing great! Yes-yes-yes! Take control! Yes!
Weee!!!
Yes!! Yes!!!
Oh! Oh! Oh no!! You swore!
I-I just thought you were doing so well. I...
I am shocked! Shocked!!
It's a legitimate learning technique. Wow!
Hey, there's uh, some people outside, askin' about candy.
Well, they're just gonna have to wait aren't they? I've only got two hands!!
Need some help?
No! You don't know the system! There'll be nobody messing with the system!
By the way, the week before your wedding you may not see a lot of me.
Oh, hello liar.
Look, I-I'm really sorry I let go of the bike.
I could've been killed I hope you know!
I know. I know. But, can we please try it again? Huh? I mean, you were so close Phoebe!
Well, I would love to but...the bike got stolen and the police have no suspects.
Phoebe.
What?! What the hell?!
All right, y'know what? If you are not going to learn how to ride this bike then I'm sorry, I'm just gonna have to take it back.
What?! Why?!
Because! Because, it-it-it's... It'd be like you having this guitar and-and never playing it. Okay, this guitar wants to be played! And-and this bike wants to be ridden and-and if you don't ride it you-you're-you're killing its spirit! The bike is dying.
All right. If you care enough to make up that load of crap, okay.
Great! Great! You're making the bike very happy.
Okay Ross! Please don't die!
Okay, I think we can get the evaluation back before they see it, but we're gonna have to get into Mr. Zelner's office. Now, he doesn't get in until 10, so he's no problem, but his assistant, Betty, she comes in early to eat her breakfast at her desk.
That's kinda sad.
Yeah, well Betty's kinda sad. Which is why I believe I can lure her away with these chocolates. Now, while I distract her, you get in the office.
Got it!
Let's roll!
Hello Rachel, you uh, got a minute?
Yeah, sure Mr. Zelner, for you anything-minute. Okay. Fine. Abort the plan, abort the plan.
Uh actually, I'd like to speak with both of you.
Okay. Uh, well can we, can we get you anything Mr. Zelner? Maybe some chocolates?
Umm, no. Thanks, but I'll give these to Betty. So I read your evaluation of Tag, or to use his full name, Tag Sweetcheeks Jones. Is something going on with you two?
Oh my God. Can you imagine if there was?! I mean, what would happen exactly.
Well, I'd be forced to file a report. I'd have to consult with the legal department, and your future at the company would be in jeopardy.
Well...
Uh Mr. Zelner, I'm the one who filled in that evaluation.
Oh no-no-no...
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, I thought it would be funny.
You wrote that you have a cute touchie?
Yes. I have a weird sense of humor, and I'm kinda strangely proud of my butt.
It's kind of a risky joke Tag, and what is-what is this drawing I can't figure out what this is?
You're lookin' at it upside down-y'know what? It doesn't matter.
Yeah, it's not like I don't have a sense of humor, huh? Hell, I even enjoy a naughty limerick now and then. But there's a time and a place, huh?! Unless you uh, have a limerick right now? No? Okay, well uh, you've got my fax number.
Whoa! I can't believe you did that. That was really sweet.
No, don't worry about it.
No, you could've lost your job.
Are you kidding me?! With a cute butt like this, I'd find work.
Thank you! You're great!
Y'know what?
What?
I feel great. In fact! What?
I... It just-it took me so long to get that desk organized.
Oh, I'm sorry.
There it is.
What is going on?
We're waiting for the candy. Bring out the candy!
Yeah lady! Give us candy!!
Joey!
What's up buddy?
What are you doing?
Waiting for candy.
Get in here! Hey, and you can not smoke in here! Merry Christmas.
Okay, guys! The candy is coming; I just need another 15 minutes for the chocolate to cool!
We want candy! We want candy now!
All right everybody! Just be quiet! Be quiet! Be quiet!! Pipe-pipe-pipe down! What is the matter with you people?! This woman was trying to do a nice thing for you. She was making candy so she could try to get to know all of you, and I'll bet that not one of you can tell me her name! Am I right?
Candy Lady?
No not Candy Lady.
Hey, if we know it can we have candy?!!
All right, y'know what? Forget it, all of you forget it! You've ruined it! Go home! You've ruined it! You've ruined it!
That's right, it's all ruined! You guys ruined everything! You ruined it!
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Did you smoke?
No! Smokes-A-Lot Lady blew smoke directly into my mouth. Eh-uh-are you okay?
I'm fine now, but it was really scary there for a while. I mean, someone slipped a-a threatening note under the door.
Oh yeah, sorry about that. Mob mentality or whatever, I don't know...
I can't believe it! I did it! I rode a bike! I never thought I'd be able to do that! Thank you Ross.
Oh hey, don't thank me, thank yourself. You're the one who faced her fears and ultimately overcame them.
Don't be so corny Ross, it's not an after-school special.
Buh-bye. I just got us reservations at Michelle's and tickets to the Musicman to celebrate our first holiday season as a betroughed couple.
Betrothed...
...betrothed couple.
Hey!
Hey!
Hi!
Haaaa... ... ahhhh!
Pheebs?
Huh?
Skull?
Oh, yeah, it's my mom's.
Oh my god!!
No, no, no. It's not! It's not my mom. It belonged to mom. Yeah, no, she used to put it out every Christmas to remind us, that even though it's Christmas, people still die. And, you can put candy in it.
Hey!
Hey!
Licorice?
Sure! Hey, I just found out, I get Ben for the holidays this year.
Ohh! That's great!
Are you gonna dress up as Santa?
Nope. I mean, I know Susan does every year, but I think I wanna take this year to teach him all about Hanukkah.
And maybe I could teach Ben about the Christmas skull and how people die.
You may need to use this year to teach Ben about Phoebe.
Hmm.
Hey.
Did you know he was in there?
No.
How long have we been home?
About a half an hour.
Lovely!
Hey, you know what I was thinking? When we get married, are you gonna change your last name to Bing?
No.
Why not?
Bing's weird.
Oh, hey, you guys!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey. Guess what! My landlord just called and my apartment is gonna get ready soon, so I guess I'll be moving out.
Ahh, Phoebe, I'm gonna miss you!
Yes, you will be very sad. All right, well I gotta go tell Rachel the good news.
Ohh! You guys gonna be living together again?
Yeah, why not?
Well, she's just so much fun with Joey, I just assumed, she'd still be living with him.
Why do you think, she's having so much fun living with Joey?
No reason, except...she...told...me.
Really? So she said, she didn't wanna live with me anymore?
No! No, she didn't say that. I-I-I think you should talk to Monica now.
Phoebe, don't worry about it. I'm sure she wants to live with you.
You're sure? You're absolutely sure?
Well, no. But, um, I bet she probably does.
Probably? Yeah, I don't like that word. Kind of what 'probably' really means. Yeah, uh-huh. Yeah, oh, "Your mom probably won't kill herself," y'know? I'm sorry, but I'm not hanging all my hopes of Rachel and I living together on-on "Probably!" Y'know? You gotta take care of yourselves! In this world history teaches us nothing!
Bing doesn't seem so weird now, does it?
Hey!
Hey! Great, you're home! Guess what Phoebe got me for Christmas!
Drums?
No! Drums!
Hi, could we get two burritos to go, please?
I'm sorry. But not that sorry, 'cause you don't have to live with it. Um, we have a reservation under the name Chandler Bing.
Oh-kay, we'll have a table for you in about 45 minutes.
Forty-five minutes? We have tickets to the Musicman at 8:00.
I'm sorry. Christmas is a very busy time, sir.
Is this because of the burrito thing?
You need to give him money.
Give him money? It was a joke!
No, to get a table! Places like are always shakin' you down. Everybody wants to be paid off.
Right, calm down, O'Mally. I'll slip him some money.
You've got to be smooth about it.
Hey, I can be smooth. Listen, we're a little bit in a hurry, so, if you can get us a table a little quicker, I'd appreciate it.
Of course, sir.
Okay.
How did it go?
Had the money in the wrong hand.
Wooooooo, hehehe. Hey, ahh, you don't feel like you're gonna throw up, do ya?
No.
Well, I do, so let's... So, Ben, you uh, you know what holiday is coming up, don't ya?
Christmas.
Yep, and you know what other holiday is coming up?
Christmas eve.
Yes, but also Hanukkah! See, you're part Jewish, and-and Hanukkah is a Jewish holiday.
Santa has reindeers that can fly!
Right, um, but, on Hanukkah, Hanukkah is a celebration of a miracle. See, years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees.
Jingle bells, jingle bells...
Okay, that's right, yes, but on Hanukkah, uh, we sing, uh Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made you out of clay.
Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer...
Okay, it's not a contest.
When is Santa coming?
Well, how about this year, instead of Santa, we have fun celebrating Hanukkah?
No Santa? Was I bad?
No! Oh, no-no-no. Hey, you weren't bad, you've been very good, Ben.
Santa's mad at me.
No, hey-hey, come on, Ben, Santa is not mad at you, okay? Hey, you're-you're his favorite little guy!
So Santa's coming?
Yes! Santa's coming!
It's easy! Just keep it casual! Give him a kind word, shake his hand and give him the money!
How do you know so much about this?
I don't know.
Richard used to do it, didn't he?
We'd be eating our soup right now.
Mustached bastard...
Okay, those people just left, come on! Quick! Give him the money and get their table!
Excuse me...
Good evening.
Ahh-hahaha!
Ha!
So you like the drums! That's, that's great! Y'know, I was worried, that, you know, they would maybe an unbearable living situation. All right, okay, well, apparently not! So, yay!
Hey-hey, Pheebs, check it out, we already learned a song. Ready? One, two, three, four...
Tequila!!
That's fun.
Here you go.
Thank you Gunther, put it there. Definitely not easier with coins. Thank you.
Thank you. Hey Pheebs!
Hey!
Here. Now I only owe you $49.50.
Hey Pheebs!
Hey!
If you wanna give Joey a Christmas present that disrupts the entire building, why not get him something a little bit more subtle, like a wrecking ball, or a vile of small pox to release in the hallway?
It's not just the drum noise. Every five minutes, Joey throws his sticks in the air, and I have to hear, "Oh my eye! Oh god, my eye!" I mean, it is so annoying.
Yes, thank you. You see, this is how normal people are supposed to react to drums.
Phoebe, you got Joey drums to annoy Rachel, so she wouldn't wanna live there anymore?
Maybe on some level.
Joey, y'know that you could just not throw the sticks up in the air.
What is Rock 'n' Roll about that?
Hey, Joey, I got you another present.
Oh wait, before you tell me what it is! Okay, what is it?
It's a...tarantula! Oh! God! Rachel, look, I'm sorry. What was I thinking giving Joey this big, gross, scary spider in such a poorly constructed cage?
What are you talking about? I love them! Yeah, I had a tarantula when I was a kid. But it-it died, because my cat ate it. And then, then my cat died. But Joey, isn't this cool?
Is it on me? I feel, I feel like it's on me! I got, hey!
Oh, isn't that adorable? Joey is afraid of the tarantula.
Ah, yeah, he's so adorable, God, he's just so much fun, Joey is the best, I'm glad you're having so much fun here.
What? Wait-wait a minute, what? Phoebe, what's the matter?
Our apartment is ready.
And that makes you angry because...
Because you would rather live here with Joey.
Where did you get that?
Monica and Chandler said that you were having so much fun here. And apparently no amount of drums or tarantulas is gonna change that.
Phoebe?
Hm?
Did you get all this stuff for Joey to try and drive me out of the apartment? Honey, if you wanted to do that, you might as well just gotten him a fish, you know how fish freaked me out!
Fish!
It wouldn't have mattered anyway, Phoebe, you and I are, are gonna live together, we're roommates; that's the deal.
Yes, but I wanted you to want to live with me, but okay, if you're having so much fun over here...
Oh, it's so much more fun with you.
We did have fun, didn't we?
We did!
Oh, anyway, they say, if we want, we can see it tonight.
Oh, I would love to!
Yay, okay!
Good, good, good, good, good.
Great, all right, okay, and Monica ask me to make the drumming stop.
Um... Done!
Hey!
Hello, Sir. You're here to return those pants?
No, these are my pants.
Oh. Okay! How can I help you?
Well, uh, do you have a Santa-outfit left?
Two days before Christmas? Sorry, man.
Okay look, do-do, you have anything Christmassy? I promised my son, and I really don't want to disappoint him, um, come on, I...uh, you gotta have something.
I'm the holiday armadillo! I'm a friend of Santa's and he sent me here to wish you a Merry Christmas!
What happened to Santa, Holiday Armadillo?
Santa was unavailable so close to Christmas.
Wow, come in, have a seat. You must be exhausted coming all the way from...Texas.
Texas?
That's right, Ben. I'm Santa's representative for all the southern states. And Mexico! But, Santa sent me here to give you these presents, Ben. Maybe the Lady will help me with these presents.
Wow! Thanks!
You're welcome, Ben. Merry Christmas, ooh, and Happy Hanukkah!
Are you for Hanukkah, too? Because I'm part-Jewish.
You are? Me, too!
Because Armadillos also wandered in the desert?
You wanna wander in the hall? Ooh, hey Ben, what if the Holiday Armadillo told you all about the festival of lights?
Cool!
Yeah!
Come on Ben.
Years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees...
Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!
Santa!
Hey!
What are you doing here, Santa?
Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben. What are you doing here, weird...turtle-man?
I'm the Holiday Armadillo, your part-Jewish friend. You sent me here to give Ben some presents. Remember?
What?
Did you bring me any presents, Santa?
You bet I did, Ben, put it there! Well, it would have worked this time, if his hands weren't so damn small! Ho, ho, ho!
Okay Ben, why don't you come open some more presents, and Santa, the Armadillo, and I have a little talk in the kitchen? There's a sentence, I never thought I'd say.
What are you doing?
You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa costume, so I borrowed one from a guy at work!
Thank you, but, but you gotta leave.
Why?
Because, I'm finally getting him excited about Hanukkah, and, and you're-you're wrecking it.
But I didn't get to shape my belly like a bowl full of jelly.
I'm sorry, Chandler but this, this is really important to me.
Fine, I'll give the suit back.
Hey, you think, you can keep it another night?
Santa? Really?
Yes, is that okay?
Did your Dad ever dress up like Santa?
No.
Then it's okay!
Okay Ben, Santa has to go. Say good-bye!
No! Why does he have to go?
Because, if Santa and the Holiday...Armadillo? ...are ever in the same room for too long the universe will implode. Merry Christmas!
No! Why can't the Armadillo leave? I want Santa!
Fine, I-I give up. Santa, Santa can stay.
Well, I'll stay, but only because I wanna hear about Hanukkah. Ben, will you sit here with Santa and learn about Hanukkah?
Okay, Santa!
All right, it's time for the story of Hanukkah. Years and years ago, there were these people called the Maccabees.
Merry Christmas!
Oh wow! Look at this place!
Oh, this is terrible. Oh, they've made so many changes I can't even feel my grandmother's presence anymore-Ooh! New sconces!
Oh my God!
What?
Okay, remember uh, remember how you told me that your grandmother put up that wall to make that into two bedrooms?
Yeah?
And remember how you always said you were afraid the landlord would find out and then tear it down?
Yeah?
Do you really not know where I'm going with this? It left! It's one huge room!
Oh no! Oh! Wow!!!
See?
Well, I guess we'll just have to put the wall back up.
You can't, because of the new skylight!
There's a skylight?! Wow!!
So what should we do? Should we start looking for a new place?
Y'know I'm-I'm sensing that um, my grandmother would not be comfortable with that.
Oh yeah? Startin' to feel her again there are we?
A little bit, yeah.
Pheebs is your grandmother maybe saying that you should live here alone?
You heard her too?! You have the gift!
Phoebe, it's okay. I like living with Joey.
Are you sure?
Oh please, I hate packing, it's closer to work, and we do have fun. Although, I'm really gonna miss living with you.
Oh me too.
I know. Oh-oh, wait did you hear that-hear that? Listen, I'm gettin' something from your grandmother, she said that since you get to keep the one bedroom apartment you should give Rachel the purple chair?
No, I do not hear that.
...and the miracle was that that little bit of oil that should've just lasted just one day, burned for...
Eight whole days.
That's right, and that's why we celebrate Hanukkah today. The end.
Awesome!
Yeah?
My favorite part was when Superman flew all the Jews out of Egypt.
The Armadillo was actually not so thrilled about that part! Okay Ben, it's time to light the Hanukkah candles!
Hey!
Oh.
Wow! It looks like the Easter Bunny's funeral in here.
Come on, come on, we're-we're-we're lighting the candles!
Oh.
Oh.
Okay, I understand why Superman is here, but why is there a porcupine at the Easter Bunny's funeral?
I got it!
Is it back in the cage?
Its back in cage!
Cage closed?
Joey, would you just come out here and stop being such a baby!
Ohh. Mmm.
Hi.
Hey, you have got to try this cheesecake.
Oh, y'know I'm not that much of a sweet tooth. I--Wow. My God, so creamy. Oh my God, this is the best cheesecake I have ever had. Where did you get this?
It was at the front door. When I got home. Somebody sent it to us.
Chandler, this is not addressed to you. This is addressed to Mrs. Braverman downstairs. Thief.
I-no! I didn't read the box before I opened it. And you can't return a box after you've opened the box.
Why, why not?
Because it's too delicious.
Chandler, you stole this cheesecake. That is wrong.
No-no-no! It is going to be okay, because Mrs. Braverman is gonna send away for a free one and that way we all win! The only losers are the big cheesecake conglomerate, Momma's Little Bakery. I feel terrible, I'm a horrible, horrible, horrible person.
Oh, I'm sorry what?
All right, I should get going, big day a work. Y'know I'm in a coma? Today, they do this test on me and it turns out I'm not brain dead.
So...
Ah-ah-ah Mr. Smartie Pants, it's just not my character that's not brain dead. Hey, so Pheebs, we still on for tonight?
Absolutely!
I'll see you at 8:00.
Okay.
Oh, what's at 8:00?
Oh, I have dinner plans with Joey. We get together about once a month to discuss the rest of you guys.
Wow, did not know that! May I say how lovely you look today?
Duly noted.
Thanks. Oh! So for tomorrow, do you want to rent a car and drive down together or what?
What are you talking about?
Cousin Frannie's wedding, its tomorrow night.
You were invited?!
No.
My God, I can't believe this! I mean I knew that mom and dad were invited, but I thought that was it! I mean from the ages 7 to 9 Frannie and I were inseparable!
Well, maybe since the age of 9, Frannie's made some new friends.
Well l-look okay, it's probably just a mistake. Let me call Aunt Sheryl okay? Maybe you are invited and the invitation just got lost in the mail.
Yeah, well you call her and tell her that y'know when we were kids her precious little Frannie tried to undress me several times, okay? And if I hadn't have stopped her, there probably wouldn't even be a wedding to go too.
Y'know, she tried to undress me too.
I used to undress my cousin Glenn.
Joseph Francis Tribbiani are you home yet?!!
Umm, I think he's still out. What's wrong?
Well, I'll tell you Rachel Karen Green, I had plans with Joey tonight and he left me this note.
"Pheebs, can't make it, got a date. Talk to you later. Big Daddy." Big Daddy?
Oh that's a nickname we were trying out.
Hey, y'know what nickname never caught on? The Ross-A-Tron!
Hey!
Oh! Here's Joseph Francis!
Oh-Wha-Ho! What are you middle naming me for?! I left you a note!
So what?! That doesn't give you the right to ditch me!
Hey, you can cancel plans with friends if there is the possibility for sex!
Phoebe he's right, that is the rule.
I don't accept this rule. When me make plans, I expect you to show up. Okay, I can't just be a way to kill time 'til you meet someone better! Y'know boyfriends and girlfriends come and go, but this is for life!
Wow! I'm so sorry; I had no idea it would bother you this much.
Well, it does.
Okay, can I-can I make it up to you? Huh? I'm sorry. How about uh, dinner tomorrow night?! I'll pay for myself!
Okay, you wore me down.
Hey Joe, while you're over there how about another beer for the Ross-A-Tron?
The Ross-Is that back?!!
Hi!
Another cheesecake came! They delivered it to the wrong address again!
So just bring it back downstairs, what's the problem?
I can't seem to say goodbye.
Are you serious?! Chandler, we ate an entire cheesecake two days ago and you want more?
Well I've forgotten what it tastes like okay?!
It was cheesecake. It was fine. It had a buttery, crumbly, graham cracker crust, with a very rich yet light, cream cheese filling... Wow! My whole mouth just filled with saliva!
Y'know what? Forget it! We are just hungry! We have not had lunch! We are just light-headed! So let us go out and have lunch and forget about the cheesecake.
Yeah and we'll drop it off downstairs so that we're not tempted.
Good idea. Where do you want to go to lunch?
Momma's Little Bakery, Chicago, Illinois.
Awww! Mel Torme died.
Joey, that paper's like a year old!
Aw! Does that mean the Sam Goody's sale is over?!
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
So I finally heard back from Aunt Sheryl and apparently it wasn't a mistake. Ahh, there's-there's limited seating in the hall.
Limited seating?! I am just one tiny person!
Well yeah, but she doesn't know that. I mean, the last time she saw you-you would've turned one of those little wedding chairs into kindling.
Limited seating! Oh, that is such a lame excuse! That's not the reason she's not inviting me!
Oh what's the big deal?! I wasn't even invited to the ceremony, just the reception. And-and y'know what? If it makes you feel any better, Joan and I will just make an appearance and then, and then we'll-we'll leave early as a sign of protest.
Joan?
Yeah, Joan Tedeski my date. She's an assistant professor in the Linguistics department. Tall, very beautiful, and despite what some people say, not broad backed!
Wait a minute, you got Ross Gellar and guest?! I wasn't invited and you got "and guest?!"
Uh-uh, excuse me, I do have to interrupt on Ross's behalf. I-I think the rule applies here y'know, since she has a chance to get on broad back...
Not broad backed!
Wait a minute, y'know, you're bringing me!
What? I can't cancel on Joan!
Why not?!
Bec-Did you not hear me?! She's an assistant professor in the Linguistics department, okay? They're wild! Why do you want to come anyway?
Because! She's my cousin. I mean, we grew up together! We're family y'know? Well that's important to me.
Okay, all right, I'll take you. I'll go call Joan.
Aww that's nice. Family should be there, huh? This is her wedding, happiest day of her life.
We'll see.
Well, thank you for lunch.
What? Wait a minute, I didn't pay, I thought you paid!
So apparently we just don't pay for food anymore. Do you see what I see?
Its still there!
Mrs. Braverman must be out.
She could be out of town. Maybe she'll be gone for months.
By then, the cheesecake may have gone bad. We don't want her to come back to bad cheesecake.
No that could kill her.
Well, we don't want that.
No so we're protecting her.
But we should take it.
But we should move quick.
Why?
Because I think I just heard her moving around in there.
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
Oh my God! That's David!
David who?
David the scientist guy, David that I was in love with, David who went to Russia and broke my heart David!
Oh my God!
Oh, you say someone's name enough, they turn around.
Phoebe?
David! What-what are you doing here? Aren't you supposed to be in Russia?
Yeah, I'm just, I'm just in town for a conference. Umm, God you look phenomenal!
Well... Yeah. You look great too. Did you get a haircut?
Yeah. Well I-I got like thirty of them.
Yeah.
Umm, look I-I-I got a confession to make...
Uh-huh.
Uh, I-I-I was hoping to run into you here. I didn't know whether I should call or not, y'know I-I was only in town for a few days. And y'know, I didn't want to intrude on your life or-or anything like that, but I-I really wanted to see you and-but I didn't know if you wanted to see me.
Well, of course I would want to see you. I...I think about you all the time.
Really? Because I think about you all the time.
Really?
I mean, there's a statue in Minsk...
Uh-huh.
That reminds me of you so much, I mean umm, it-it's actually of Lenin. But, y'know at certain angles...
Yeah.
Umm, anyway...Do you want to have dinner tonight?
Yes! Oh no!
Oh. Uh, what?
I can't. I can't believe I have plans, I can't. Can you do it tomorrow night though?
Uh no, I have to go in a few hours. I have to be on the red-eye. Well listen, y'know, next time you're in Minsk umm...
Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?
Uh-huh.
What are you doing?
Well, I have plans with Joey tonight.
So! He'll understand!
No he won't. And that's not even the point! Monica, I made a whole speech about you do not cancel plans with friends! And now y'know what? Just because, potentially, the love of my life comes back from Russia just for one night, I-I should change my beliefs?! I should change beliefs! No! No! No, if I don't have my principles, I don't have anything!
God, you are so strong.
Or! I should rush through dinner with Joey and I can meet David at 9:00!
Oh my God! That is so good!
I'm full, and yet I know if I stop eating this, I'll regret it.
Hey!
Hey!
What do you got there?
Oh it's umm, it's tofu cake. Do you want some?
What are you doing tonight?
Huh? Uh...
Dude! Dude!
Oh! Sorry. Uh, I've got those plans with Phoebe, why?
Oh really? Uh, Monica said she had a date at 9:00.
What?! Tonight?!
That's what Monica said.
After she gave me that big speech?! She goes and makes a date with a guy on the same night she has plans with me? I think she's trying to pull a fast one on Big Daddy!
Oh here, I think this is us. Yeah.
Limited seating my ass. Let's see who made the cut. Hi!
Hi!
I'm Monica Gellar. Who do you know the bride and groom?
Oh, I used to work with Frannie.
Used to work with her. Used to! I'm a relative and I didn't get invited! A blood relative! Blood!!
Stop saying, "Blood" to strangers.
So, how about you huh? How do you know the happy couple?
We went to college with both of them and now we live next door.
Okay, you're fine.
Hey!
Hey!
Are you guys ready?
Yes! I will have the green salad, umm the house salad, and water's fine.
Okay.
Okay.
And for you sir?
Yeah, this slow roasted salmon, just how slow are we talkin' here?
It's uh, it's already been roasted.
Ohh, then no. Maybe I should hear those specials again.
Oh Joey, we've heard the specials three times! Okay? There's prime rib, mahi mahi, and a very special lobster ravioli.
Actually we're out of the lobster ravioli.
Oh well, that changes everything! Y'know what Pheebs?
Huh?
You were right before. I mean, friends are so important.
Yeah, I'm very wise. I know.
Y'know-y'know what I really want?
What?
Is to have a long, long talk. Y'know? Get Joey out on the open road and really open him up.
Any progress?
Yes! I will have the lobster ravioli.
God Joey, this is taking forever!
What's the rush? What?
W-w-I just-it's that-I have-y'know I have-I have an appointment. And it's very important.
Whoa-whoa, what is it?
Well... It's a date.
A date?! No, no Pheebs you-you must be mistaken, because I know you wouldn't schedule a date on the same night you have plans with a friend!
Come on Joey, don't make me feel badly about this.
No, I'm gonna!! That's right! Yeah, you made me feel really guilty about goin' out with that girl! Like-like-like I did something terrible to you! And now Pheebs, you're doing the same thing!
That-It's not the same thing! This is totally different! This is with David! Remember David, the scientist guy? Okay, he's very special to me.
Okay, well my girl from the other night was special. She was a scientist too!
She was?
Well, she graduated from high school!
Okay, whatever. Y'know what? I don't have time have time to convince you because he's only here for four hours, and I'm gonna go see him!
Fine!
Yeah!
Fine!
Yeah!
What are you still doin' here?! I told you, lobster ravioli!
Hey!
Hey! Oh, I was just about to leave. I-I-I-I didn't think you were coming.
Oh, I wouldn't miss this.
Well, I'm very glad you're here.
Oh, you're such a gentleman. Come on! We're going to my place!
Are you eating the cheesecake without me?!
Mm-mmm.
I will give you a hundred dollars to whistle right now. How can you eat the cheesecake without me?!
Oh, what are you going to do?! Are you gonna go run tell Monica?! Are you gonna tell Joey?! No! Because then you will have to tell them what we did! We are desert stealers! We are living outside the law!
Y'know what? I don't trust you with this cake anymore! And I got it first, and I'm takin' it back!
What?! What?!
Oh yes!
Wait a minute!
Oh yes!
Oh no-no-no-no-no, no you don't!
Oh yes! Oh yes!
You think I trust you with it?! No! We're gonna split it! You take half and I take half!
Well that's not fair, you've already had some!
What? Oh, well then y'know what? I think Monica would be very interested to know that you called her cheesecake dry and mealy.
What do we use to split it?
Okay! All right, pick a half.
Okay well, this side looks bigger. Uh... There's more crust on this side. Y'know? So, maybe if I measured...
Oh for God sake just pick a piece!
All right, I'll pick that one.
That's also the smaller piece. Okay, there you go. Enjoy your half my friend, but that is it. No sharing. No switching, and don't come crying to me if you eat your piece to fast. Oh!!!!
Ohhh!
Okay, you gotta give me some of your piece.
Oh-ho-ho-ho-no! No! No switching! No sharing, and don't come crying to me! Ha-ha-ha! I may just sit here and have my cake all day! Just sit here in the hallway and eat my...
Ross, sweetheart!
Oh, hey Aunt Millie.
Isn't it a beautiful wedding?!
Yes, yes it is. It's uh... Every time on the lips! Why?! Why on lips?!
Here's Frannie. Hmm, won't she be happy to see me?
Now wait a minute, you be nice! All right? I didn't bring you here so you can ambush her.
Frannie was the one who found your Playboys and showed them to mom.
That bitch!
Monica! What...
Am I doing here? Why? Surprised to see me? Ross brought me. How do you like that?!
Hi Frannie, congratulations.
You invite my brother, you invite my whole family, and not me?! Why?! What-Why wouldn't you want me at your wedding? What could I have possibly done?! Stuart!
I believe you know my husband.
So it's really a question of who could you have possibly done.
Oh, I hate this but I-I-I have to go. I-I can't miss my flight.
Are you sure? I'll bet there's another flight to Minsk in like...
July. Umm,
That's really beautiful. What does it mean?
Please, clean my beakers. I don't get out of the lab much.
That's good. I got to admit, I thought it was something else.
Yeah, I... Well I really actually wanted to say umm, that, but um, I figured I probably shouldn't because y'know, I...have to leave.
You're right! You're right. Don't say it.
I-I do though.
I do too.
Bye Phoebe.
Okay, now's not the time Joey. All right? You can yell at me tomorrow.
No! No! No Pheebs, I'm not gonna yell at you. I just y'know, started thinking about you and David and I...remember how bummed you were the first time he left. And I just... Oh Pheebs, come here. Are you okay?
No I'm not okay. The only guy I've ever been crazy about has gone to Minsk and I may never...I may never see him again.
Hey, y'know you could always visit him.
Oh right, like they're gonna let me have a passport.
Anything I can do? Whatever you need.
Well-But-Now, if-if you can achieve positronic distillation of sub-atomic particles y'know before he does, then he can come back.
I can give it a shot.
Oh! Yay! Look! There's a piece that doesn't have floor on it!
Stick to your side!
Hey, come on now!
All right, what are we havin'?
Oh wait I forgot my wrap.
What? Oh, okay. Wait here.
Hi sweetie! Are you leaving?
Well...
Give us a kiss. Come on! Come on!
Why?! Why on the lips?!
Ross, when's this comet thing start?
Well, technically it seven billion years ago...
Oh no! Oh no!
Okay! Okay! Fine, I'll stop! No teaching, okay? We'll just watch the pretty light streaking across the sky. Okay? Who's official name is Bapstein-King.
Okay! Okay!
There it is! Oh, look at that! Isn't Mother Nature amazing?
That's a plane!
Well, all right. 1700 bags of peanuts flying that high, that's pretty amazing too.
Hey, I wonder if you can see my apartment from up here.
No. No, you can't.
What?
Oh I don't-I don't know.
Man, look at all those stars! Infinite space. It really, really makes you wonder, doesn't it?
Y'know what else makes you wonder?
Huh?
Check out the rack on this chick!
Okay, we've been out here for two hours and we haven't seen any stupid comets. Can we go now? I mean, Chandler's getting chilly.
No, I'm not!
Then why are you wearing Monica's jacket?
Because it's flattering! Come on Monica! Come on Monica!
Yeah actually, I think we're gonna take off too. We rented a movie.
Oh! I won't say, 'no' to a movie!
Uh Pheebs, we just actually kinda wanted to be alone.
Shh! Get me out of here.
Oh.
Ross!
What?
Come here, check this out!
What? Is it the comet?
No! No-no. Look, there's a bug stuck in tar right here.
Joey come-I can't believe-I bring you here to see the Bapstein-King comet, one of nature's most spectacular phenomenon, and all you care about are bugs stuck in tar and-and some woman!
Y'know, there's two women dude.
Show me where?
Right-right up here.
Joey where's the pipe that was holding the door open?
I don't know! Yeah, I do.
Joey!
What?! All right-Hey! Don't look at me! You're the one who wanted to come up and look for some stupid Burger King comet!
It's called the Bapstein-King comet, okay? Hey! Hey! Bapstein was a very well respected astronomer!
Oh no! No! No!
Monica!
She's sleeping.
I know, just quick-quick question, quick question. Which one was Deep Impact and which one was Armageddon?
Deep Impact was the one with Robert Duval, Armageddon is what's going to happen to you if you wake me up.
Sorry, I just...can't sleep. Ooh! Where is that book that you are reading with the two women who were ice-skating and wearing, wearing those hats with the flowers on it? Because every time I look at that cover I'm like...
It is in the living room where there is also a light! And no one will kick you in the shin.
What?! Ow!
Please don't be a space ship. Please don't be a space ship. Oh thank God! How could you be beeping?! I just disconnected you! I took out your battery! How can...
Beep!
Don't interrupt me!!
Rachel!! Monica!!
Come on!
I can't believe this!!
All right well, y'know...I guess we know what we have to do to get down.
Yeah, I guess we don't have a choice. Help us! Please help us! We're stuck up on the roof and we can't get down!!!
Ross. I was thinking we could just go down the fire escape.
I know, I wasn't finished. But don't worry! We're gonna go down the fire escape!!
Shhhhhhhhh!!! I'm sorry, I thought maybe I'd make some warm milk and it would help me sleep.
With a wok? I thought you were going to read my boring book to put you asleep.
It got interesting! Damn you Oprah!
Here, let me make the milk, I'm up anyway.
Hey, y'know what we can do? Y'know, now that we are up? We can just like talk to each other all night long, y'know like we did when we were first going out. It'd be fun!
Okay that does sound like fun.
Okay, so how bummed were you when the second sister died huh?
The second sister dies?!
No. No, I-I was, I was talking about the book I was reading.
The second sister dies in Archie and Jughead Double Digest?
That's correct.
You wanna go in the bedroom? It's a little more comfortable.
Sure.
Okay. Oh wait! Umm, did you send those contracts to Milan?
If this is your idea of sexy talk?
No seriously, y'know the contracts I gave you, did you overnight them?
What contracts?
Okay please tell me that this is just one of your jokes that you do that I don't get.
Like what?
Y'know, like the thing when you put the phone in your pants? Tag! I'm serious! This isn't funny! Those contracts absolutely had to go out today!
Rach, I'm sorry, but you didn't give me any contracts!
Yes I did! And I put a little Post-It on it that said, "Must go out today," and underlined today three times and, and then I put a little heart in the corner because I didn't want to seem to bossy.
I'm telling you, you never gave them to me.
Y'know what Tag, if we went down to the office you would see those contracts sitting on your desk.
No, I would see you looking embarrassed because they are not on my desk!
Or maybe you would see me looking embarrassed because you are talking on the phone with your crotch!
You wanna go down to the office right now?
No! Come on its late, we're not gonna go down to the office.
Okay I understand. I wouldn't want to be proved wrong either.
Okay get your coat! Oh! When did you unhook this? Nice work!
All right, it won't go down any further. It's stuck.
Ugh. Well, we're just gonna have to jump. Yeah. Now, we're gonna have to make sure to land to the right of that patch of ice, okay? Not hit the dumpster on the other side and uh, and try to avoid that-that weird brownish red stuff in the middle. So, when you get down there...you go up to the roof and you let me in.
Oh whoa-whoa wait a minute! I have to do it?!
Yeah! Oh yeah, you'll be fine! It-it'll be uh, just like bungy jumping. Y'know? But instead of bouncing back up you-you won't.
What if I smack my head on the concrete?
Well, I'm gonna lie to you Joey, it's a possibility.
I don't know Ross! I-I tell you what, let's flip to see who does it, okay? You-you call it in the air, all right?
Oh, all right. Tails! Can you-can you see what it is?
No.
Okay. Well, you be careful.
What? No! No Ross! No-no! Stop! I'm not jumping! Okay, look I have an audition tomorrow and I can't go if I break my leg.
Well I'm jumping! I have a son! Okay? He won't have a father if-if I die!
Well all right so, it looks like we're even!
Okay. So, this wire is connected to this wire which plugs into here. Okay so, to get the beeping to stop all I have to do... Well done, Pheebs. What do you want from me?!!!!!!!
Okay, here's your milk. What do you want to talk about?
What? What? What?
Ohh! Ohhhh! Were you sleeping sweetie? I'm sorry. Here.
Okay! Feel free to look, but I'm telling you those contracts are not on this desk.
Oh how can you possibly know? Look at this mess, Tag! I mean, this is what I'm talking about! You have to be organized! You've got newspapers! You've got magazines! You got-Ohh! And who is this chippy? A little young for you Tag, but whatever.
It's my sister.
Okay, very cute braces. Anyway y'know what, the point is Tag, start looking because you are going to find those contracts on your desk.
So when do you imagine you gave them to me? In the morning or in the afternoon?
In the afternoon. Mr. Zelner came into my office after lunch. He put them on my desk, and then I put a Post-It on it that said, "Must go out today." So you just keep looking in there! All right?
It's not here.
Puzzler. A bit of a puzzle. Why don't you um, check the copy room, maybe you left the contracts in there?
How could I have left them in the copy room?
I don't know Tag! How can your genitals make phone calls? Okay? It's not a perfect world! Just go please.
Fine.
Thank you. Hello? I still don't get it.
Are you still awake?
Yeah! You?
You do know that was me who just said that right? Hey. As long as we're both up...
Yeah? I hope you're not thinking about cleaning the living room.
Man, I'm starving! What the hell was I thinking at dinner?! "Do you want soup or salad?" Both! Always order both!
Y'know, y'know I'm lookin' and I don't think anyone's home here. I say we just break the window, crawl through, and-and y'know explain later.
Yeah? Really? No one's home?
I don't think so. Hello? When you get in there...
Okay, this is where you and I part ways. Noisy bitch!
What?! What are you doing?!
Do you know what just happened?
Yeah. We-we had sex and then we fell asleep.
No. We were in the middle of sex...and you fell asleep.
Nooo! No, that's not true. No, best time ever! Yeah, you rocked me world!
Monica?
What?!
I was giving you some of my best moves, and you missed it. So please wake up so we can do it right!
Okay. Okay, I'm ready. Come on big fella!
Okay.
Give me the good stuff.
Yeah! No! No! No! Don't fall asleep! Okay, I am going to make you some coffee. And I probably won't spill coffee grounds all over the kitchen floor.
Okay, I'm up! I'm up!
Hi! I got you some coffee. To, uh... ...fair enough. So! Do you got anything for me?
Still no luck.
Oh my God! Did you check your entire desk! Did you check all the drawers!
Do you want me to check again?
Well yeah, I wish that you would. Well, no it's not in there! How about that drawer?
Well, it's not out here. Is there any chance it could be in your office?
Y'know, I don't-I don't know. Let me, let me check.
Any luck?
Can I see you in my office for a minute?
Yeah? You found them!! Y'know what? I'm not even going to gloat. I'm just really relived this whole thing is over.
You put these on my desk!
I did not!
Oh really? So you're saying they just slid out of your bottom drawer, crawled across the floor, then jumped on to my desk?!
How did you know they were in my bottom drawer?
I am so hot for you right now.
Oh my God! How did you get back here?!
Phoebe Buffay?!
Fire alarm? Oh! Hi, officer-fireman, can-can I help you?
We found your fire alarm in the trash chute.
That's not mine.
Yes it is.
How do you know?
The next time you want to dump a fire alarm in a trash chute, don't wrap it in a blanket that says, "Property of Phoebe Buffay not Monica."
Okay do you-Okay, do you have a search warrant? Because the last time I checked this was still America!
Please reattach this, it's against the law to disconnect them.
Fine! But please God; tell me how to stop them from going off!
There's a reset button under the plastic cover.
There's a reset button?! Ugh, thank you! Thank you! There's a reset button! My God! Why didn't I see that! Reset button, reset button, where is there a reset button? Oh here it is! Oh! Ohh, God!
Okay, do-do you have a good grip?
Yeah!
Okay, I'm going to start climb down you now.
All right! Just hurry up!
Okay. Now-now-now should I climb down your front so we're face to face or-or should I climb down your back so we're-we're butt to face.
I think face to face.
I would say that.
Face to face, yeah!
Okay, here I go.
All right.
Oh my... How much do you weigh Ross?!
I prefer not to answer that right now, I'm still carrying a little holiday weight.
Y'know, when we talked about face to face, I don't think we thought it all the way through.
So what do you want me to do?
Well, just shimmy down me and drop!
Hi.
Hi.
M-maybe I should hang and you can climb down me.
Yeah? Maybe we should talk about that for a little while!
It's still looks pretty far!
It's not that far! Just drop!
Do not rush me!!
Ross, you should know that my pants are startin' to come down and I'm not wearing any underwear!
Oww!! My ankle! I really hurt my ankle! I think I twisted it when I-Ooh, a quarter!
That really was some of your best work.
Hm-hmm, I told you! I can't believe that I've only got two hours before I call in sick for work.
I have to be up in seven minutes.
Well, you're not gonna believe this, but if you have seven minutes...
Really?!
Do you wanna?
Okay! You get the vacuum cleaner and I'll get the furniture polish!
Hey.
Hey.
What are you doing?
Well, y'know I was thinking of moving the couch over here.
Why would you want to do that?
So that there will be a decent place for me to sit.
Rach, there is a decent place to...
And your lap does not count! Okay? Come on help me move this.
No. No. No.
No?
No. Rosita does not move.
I'm sorry, Rosita? As in...
As in Rosita does not move.
Joey, it's just a chair! What's the big deal?
The big deal is that it is the exact equal distance from the bathroom to the kitchen and it's at the perfect angle so you don't get any glare coming of off Stevie.
Stevie the TV?
Is there a problem?
No! Oh what does he know! Come on Rosita, us chichas got to stick together! You bitch!
Hey, y'know what's weird? After you guys get married, when you introduce me to people you're gonna have to say, "This is my brother-in-law Ross." Not, "My friend Ross," "brother-in-law Ross." That's weird isn't it?
Couldn't I just say, "This is Ross?"
Sure, do whatever you want.
Hey Ross! So, I was checking out the uh, real estate section...
Yeah?
Look at this.
Oh, it looks like mom and dad's house. Oh, it even has a tree with a broken limb out front and the uh, the window in the attic is...Oh my God!!
What? What happened to the window in the attic?!
I can't believe mom and dad are selling the house!
I can't believe they-they didn't even tell us!
I can't believe I still don't know what happened to the window in the attic!
Uh, hello dad! Monica and I just saw the house in the paper! Yes we're surprised! Who did you leave a message with?
Sorry!
Joey, Joey I am so sorry.
I told you not to move it! Rach, how would you feel if say, I wanted to move you mom, and you said don't, and I did it anyway and her head fell off?
Okay, come on-Joey, I'll buy you a new one! All right? We'll go down to the store right now and we'll-we'll get you a new chair.
She's not even cold yet!
But don't you think Rosita would've wanted you to move on? I mean y'know, she did always put...your comfort first.
That's true.
Okay? You ready?
Yeah, I... I don't want Stevie to see her like this.
I can't believe we have to say goodbye to the house we grew up in. Man, some-some stranger's gonna be living in my room.
Well, after 15 years of mom and dad keeping it as a shrine to you, it's time the velvet ropes came down.
They kept your room for a while.
Oh please! Dad turned my room into a gym 20 minutes after I moved out! I gotta say, a tanning bed and a stack of Victoria's Secret catalogues, not a gym!
Come on, you know they love you.
As much as they love you?
I was their first born! They thought she was barren! It's not my fault.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey!
Ugh, I hate this year!
What's wrong with this year?
Well okay, it's already February and I've only given two massages and they were both the worst tippers in the world!
That was me and Ross.
Oh that's right!
Hey, y'know if you want to pick up some extra cash? Some friends of mine made good money doing telemarketing.
Oh that's a great idea. You're really good on the phone.
Yeah and yeah, and it would probably be better than the last telephone job I had. Y'know, I probably wouldn't have to say spank as much.
What?
Oh yeah, like you never called!
So basically this is very easy. You read from the script and try to sell as much toner as you possibly can.
Okay, I can do that! Oh, by the way, I love my office.
Why don't we do a trial run.
Oh okay. Umm, all right. Hi, this is Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies, can I speak to your supply manager please?
I'm the supply manager.
Umm, okay I would like to talk to you about your toner needs.
We don't need any toner.
Oh okay, well I'm sorry to bother you. Bye-bye. Yeah you're right, this is easy.
Okay, what was wrong with that call?
Oh well, all right...um, no offense, but you were kind of rude.
They're always going to tell you they don't need toner, but that's okay because whatever they say, you can find the answer to it here in this script.
Oh.
So, I think you're ready to sell toner, do you have any last questions?
No. Oh wait yes! I do, I do have one question. What is toner?
Joey! Joe! Full bag. Beer's still cold. Something terrible must've happened here! Oh no-no-no-no-no-no! Stevie, I was never here!
Dad?
I'm here!
Hey!
Hi. God, it seems like just yesterday you guys used to come out to watch me work.
Dad, we-we can't believe you're selling the house.
Well, it's time for a new family to start their memories here and hopefully their check will clear before they find the crack in the foundation and the asbestos in the ceiling.
Let's grab our stuff and get the hell out of here.
I'm sorry we can't store your childhood things anymore.
Oh, that's okay, I can't wait to see everything again! All of the memories...
Well, I don't know what's in the boxes down here, but I do know there are six or seven Easy Bake Ovens in the attic.
I used to love to play restaurant.
Yeah, not as much as you used to love to play uncooked batter eater.
Hey, it is unreasonable to expect a child to wait for a light bulb to cook brownies!
So, I think you're boxes are over here.
Wow! Great! Wait, dad who-who's cigarettes are these?
I don't know. They-they must be your mother's, but please, please don't ask her. I'll throw these away.
Cool! Dad! My report cards! Hey, check this out dad, Math, A. Science, A. History, A. Gym... Oooh, my rock polisher!
Oh look, look there's your old makeup kit!
It's a clown kit! Clown kit!
Well, the white seems to be untouched. Uh-oh.
What?
Y'know how the garage floods every Spring?
How are you ever going to sell this place?
I think I accidentally used Monica's boxes to keep the water away from the Porsche.
Oh no. Dad! Dad! What... Oh God...everything's ruined! Dad, she's gonna be crushed!
You don't secretly smoke do you?
No!
So it's just your mother then.
Hi, this Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies, can I speak to your supply manager please? Earl, thanks. Hi Earl, this is Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies I'd like to talk to you about your toner needs.
I don't need any toner.
I'm hearing what you're saying, but at our prices everyone needs toner.
Not me.
May I ask why?
You wanna know why. You wanna know why?
I surely do!
Okay, I don't need any toner because I'm going to kill myself.
Umm, is-is that because you're out of toner?
Okay, so...no toner today. Thanks anyway, bye-bye.
No-no wait-wait! I can't just let you hang up! Just please talk to me.
Well...I Only Have One Thing To Do Today. I guess I could push it back.
Yeah! Now, why do you want to kill yourself?
It's just that I uh, have been working for ten years now at this meaningless, dead-end job and nobody here even knows I exist!
Chandler?
I-I'm sorry?
No look, I-I'm sure that people know you exist!
Oh yeah? I work in a cubicle surrounded by people. I've been talking to you for five minutes now about killing myself and no one's even looked up from their desk. Hang-hang on. Hey everybody! Uh, I'm gonna kill myself! I'll get back to ya. I got nothing. Wait. Uh, hey Marge! Ehh, nothing. Nothing.
My chair. Now, if anybody asks, your name is Rosita!
You will like it!
No I won't.
You don't even know!
Because, I know what I like and what I don't like! It's not the same thing!
Well look, if you don't like this...
I don't know why you say that so soon.
Come on Joey, I just bought you a new chair! The most expensive one in the store! Hey, y'know what I was thinking? We could name her Francette.
Francette? What is she? A couch?
Poor thing. Cut down in her prime.
Joey, the new chair will be here in an hour. Maybe we should actually move Rosita out of here. Y'know, start the heeling process?
Well, I guess you're right. Maybe, maybe I'll take her down to the incinerator. It's gonna be so said, and kinda cool. She's heeled!
That's weird.
No it's not weird, it's a miracle!
It's not a miracle Joey! I'm sure there's some explanation.
Oh there is! If you want something enough and your heart is pure, wondrous things can happen!
Joey, I really don't...
Can you tell me how this happened?
Well no.
Miracle!
No, y'know what? Maybe somebody came in here and fixed it! Or something!
Someone like an...angel?
That's right Joey, the chair angel came in and heeled your chair.
Get your non-believer ass outta my chair!
Well, she'll understand right? It's not like I did it on purpose.
Dad that won't matter to her. Look, all my stuff is safe and dry and all her is-is, is growing new stuff! See, this is exactly the kind of thing that makes her think you guys love me more than you love her.
Oh my God, does she really thinks that?
Well, can you blame her?
Well I don't know, I-I suppose we may have favored you unconsciously, you were a medical marvel! The doctor said your mother could...
Dad, dad I don't want to hear about it.
Really?
Well, not right now. Okay look, Monica came here for some memories and damnit, we're gonna give her some! Okay, grab...grab some empty boxes. Okay? We'll-we'll take stuff from mine and whatever we can pass off as hers we'll-we'll put 'em in their.
Great!
Like uh y'know like this! This! She-she could've made this!
Sure!
Right? And this! She-she could've won this!
This could've been hers!
Sure! Ooh-ooh, what about this?
Your make-up kit? I'd feel better.
I am so psyched I kept this chair for myself!
Yeah, me too.
Hey, how's...how's the uh, miracle chair?
Fine.
Yeah? Wow! Y'know, that this thing has speakers in the headrest!
No. Really?
Yeah! You can hook it up to your TV and you get radio!
My chair heels itself.
Earl, you're not hearing me! All I'm saying is that you're not alone all right? Everybody hates the people they work with!
Hey guy!
Wait, what was that? That sounded like someone being nice to you.
No! That's just the "Hey Guy" guy. He says that to everybody! He's the worst! I'd like to take him with me!
All right so Earl, let's just forget about the people at the office, okay? There-there's gotta be someone else in your life worth sticking around for! What about-what about your family, your friends, or maybe your girlfriend?
Yeah! Right!
Oh sorry, boyfriend!
Oh no.
No, whatever! Anything!
Hey guy!
Yeah, he's gotta go.
Okay, I should, I should probably be getting back to my thing now. See ya.
No! I'm not finished yet! Don't! Don't you dare hang up on me!!!
The new girl's good.
Hey guys! Hey!
Hey.
Hey, I just whipped us up some Easy Bake treats, they should be ready in about three days.
That's a good one! Do you hear that Ross? Three days!
Yeah! Yeah! Oh, this will make a great memory.
Okay. So, which boxes are mine?
Well, these. These are yours right here.
Okay. Oh! A coloring book!
Yeah. Yeah, oh you loved that thing. You always had it with you. You never went anywhere without-without that coloring book.
Really? Wow! It looks like I had some trouble staying inside the lines.
Nu-uh!
Oh, an old glove?
Oh, yeah you loved that glove! You took it every place you went. You never went any place without that glove.
Wow! Look At This! I Can'T Believe I Even Fit Into This Shirt! Oh, this is yours.
Oh, I don't know how that got in there.
This isn't mine. Hey, this isn't, this isn't my stuff! Ugh, Ross! These are your boxes! Where are my boxes?
Umm, your boxes are umm...
What?
Dad?
Well, the garage flooded sweetie and it ruined everything in your boxes. I'm sorry.
Just mine?
I'm afraid so.
So why-why wasn't Ross's stuff ruined? And if you say the words medical marvel I'm going to Easy Bake your head!
Well, I used your boxes to divert water away from the Porsche.
So wait, Ross's stuff is fine, but I have no memories because you wanted to keep the bottom two inches of your car away from water!!!
There was also leaves and guk and stuff.
I can't believe this!
Screw it! I'm having one.
Hey Chandler!
Hey!
How would you like to sit in a chair that fully reclines, has a rolling massage, and speakers in the head rest?
Yeah, I'd love to but I've tried that so many times they won't even let me in the store anymore.
Well what if I told you, you can do it in my apartment?
Are you telling me that you bought the chair that is making all other lounge systems obsolete? The chair that Sit magazine called the Chair of the Year?
I just purchased the La-Z-Boy E-cliner 3000.
That's awesome! That's great! What made you do it?!
Well, it's a long story, but umm I broke Joey's chair...
Whoa-whoa-whoa! You broke Joey's chair?
Yeah.
I thought I broke Joey's chair! That's why I replaced it with mine!
Ohhhhh. That's how it got fixed!
Well, what did you think, that-that elves came in and fixed it?
Noo! Angels.
I'm gettin' my chair back!
What? Wh-hey!
Well, it looks like it wasn't heeled after all! Yeah! So, I guess this chair is mine now!
Joey you broke my chair!!
Your chair?!
Yeah, he thought he broke your chair so he switched the chairs!
So, there was no miracle?!
No Joe, no miracle.
Oh no this is devastating! My faith is shaken. I'm so glad I have the new chair to get my through this difficult time in my life.
Uh-huh! Nice try, but you don't get that chair anymore! All right? That is my chair now! You can sit on my lap! No I take that back!
I think I should get the chair!
How do you figure?
Because you broke a chair and you broke a chair! The only one around here that hasn't broke a chair, is me!
No-no-no! This chair's not going anywhere.
Well, where's the logic in that?!
The logic is, that there are two of us and we are both strong enough to break a chair in half!
So Joey breaks my chair and I get nothing!
That's right!
What are you guys? Like a gang or something?!
Yeah! We are!
We're the Cobras!
Excuse me! Can you tell me where I can find Earl? He's the supply manager around here.
Sorry, I don't know any Earl.
I'm right here!!!!
Earl! I'm Phoebe.
Phoebe? The lady who sells toner?
Umm, look it, you-you can't kill yourself.
Look, um I really appreciate your coming down...
No-no I can't! I can't let you do it!
Why?!
Because it was fate that made me call you today!
I thought it was toner.
No! Think about it okay? This isn't even my regular job! Okay? And my first day on the job, you're my first call! And-and somebody else might've hung up on you, but I wouldn't do that because I know about this stuff. My mom killed herself.
Really?!
Yes.
How?
I'm not gonna give you tips! Look don't you see that this-this...this all came together so that I could stop you from doing this.
Couldn't it just be a coincidence?
No, it's fate!
It doesn't really seem like enough to be fate.
Oh. Well umm, okay here's a weird thing. My mother was also a supply manager.
I'm actually the office manager.
Oh my God! So was she! And! Get this, okay? Your-your name is Earl, right? Her name was Pearl, P-Earl.
Well, was there anything else?!
Sure! Umm, where are you from?
Philadelphia.
Oh my God! So was she! Oh, I've got-I've got goose bumps.
Really?
Well, y'know I'm wearing layers and it's warm.
Yeah-yeah.
But if-no look, okay. These jerks might not care about you, but the universe does! And that says a lot!
Did you hear that?! I don't need you guys to care about me! Because the universe cares! The whole universe! I really wished they'd care just a little bit though.
Y'know, I don't-I don't think it's you. This is a freaky place. Hey! Guys! Oh no, it's you.
Yeah.
Oh, this terrible! Everything is destroyed! Look at this. It obviously meant enough for me to save it, and I don't even know what it is! Ohh, it's still soft. What do you think this is?
All right. I think it was a mouse.
How are you honey?
How do you think I am?! You've wrecked all my childhood memories. You love Ross more than me. And I just rubbed a dead mouse on my face!
Sweetheart, we love you just as much as Ross! Now, I'm sorry about everything that happened and I'd probably never be able to make it up to you, but here's a start.
What's this?
It's the key to my Porsche. Well, the key to your Porsche.
What?!
What?!!!
I've been thinking about getting rid of it. I was driving it the other day and saw my reflection in a store window. Your mother's right, I do look like an ass.
Wait, you're giving me your Porsche, you're kidding me right?!
Well w-w-w-w-wait, w-wait, wait, wait a minute! I mean a couple of stupid boxes get wet and she gets a Porsche?!
Why don't we take it for a spin?
All right!
Well, what about me?! I'm a medical marvel!!
Oh yeah.
Ahhhh....
Ahhh...... Eh?
Uh-huh.
Hey guys!
Hey!
Hey!
Do you guys know what happened to Chandler's barca lounger?
Oh yeah, Joey broke it. Had to get rid of it.
Are you kidding?! I get a Porsche and the barca lounger's gone?! This is the best day ever!
Happy birthday!!!
Happy birthday!!!
Rach! Come on! Rach!
It's your birthday!
Hey.
She's not as pretty as she was when she was 29.
Ms. Green would like to establish some ground rules before she comes out. She would appreciate it if you don't use the words old or downhill or they still look pretty damn good.
They do!
Rachel! Come on out! Monica made breakfast!
Chocolate-chip pancakes!
We've got presents!
Good ones?
They all came from the list you handed out to us two weeks ago.
Well, can I keep the presents and still be 29?
Come on Rach! Look, turning thirty is not that big a deal.
Oh really. Is that how you felt when you turned thirty?
Why God?!! Why?!! We had a deal!! Let the others grow old! Not me!!
Y'know, I'm still 29 in Guam.
Hey, 30 is not that old! Do you know how old the Earth is?
Late thirties? Oh come on you guys! Is it just me? Am I overreacting to this?
No Rach, it's not just you. My thirtieth birthday certainly wasn't that much fun.
And now Chandler! We're all gettin' so old! Why are you doing this to us?!
Rach, you're in a great place in your life. Come on, you've got a great job! Good friends...
Yeah, you're roommate is a soap opera star.
Look, y'know I know my life's going pretty well, but I look around and I just see so many people who've accomplished so many other goals by the time they're thirty.
Yeah, but you shouldn't compare yourself to me.
Come on Phoebe! You can do it Phoebe! Come on!
There you go!
I did it! One mile on a hippity-hop! That's it!! That's everything I wanted to do before I was thirty. Oh, except I wanted to patch things up with my sister. But oh well. Yay!! And-and girls this thing is a Godsend if you know what I mean.
Thirty. Ugh, I mean thirty! Monica, do you remember mean, old Mrs. Kreeger in the fifth grade? She was thirty!
Come on, let's have some fun. Huh? What do you want to do today?
Nothing. I don't want to do anything.
Well, doing nothing on your thirtieth is better than doing something stupid, like Ross.
Hey! That was a practical purchase! I needed that car for transportation! Okay? I-I have a child!
How hot do I look in this, huh?!
Ross, a sports car? Wouldn't it have been cheaper to just stuff a sock down there?
That's not what this is about okay? I-I am a sports car enthusiast. I have always been into cars.
Hey, what's the horsepower on this thing?
I don't know, but-but look how shiny!
I can't believe you bought this.
Really! God Ross, what were you thinking? I know it's really shallow, but a part of me wants him again.
Oh, well get in line missy. So, can I have a ride stud?
Hop in. Get ready for the smoothest ride of your life.
Damnit!
Okay, who's next?
Y'know what? I am going to do something today. I'm not just gonna sit around like some old lady. I'm gonna get something pierced. Like my uh, like my nose or my tongue or something.
Really?! 'Cause y'know that hurts.
So what?! Y'know what? The way I see it--Ow! Son of a bitch!!
Look Rachel, I know what you're going through. I'm totally freaked about turning 25.
Get out, get out of my apartment.
All right Rach, for what it's worth, I think that you're doing great. I mean y'know let's face it, no one handles this well.
Least of all you.
Why? What you'd do?
Weren't you asked to leave sonny?
Would you put that back on?! Monica's gonna be here any minute!
But it hurt's my Joey's Apple.
Okay, for the last time. It's not named for each individual man.
You've done a wonderful job with this party Chandler. Everything looks so lovely.
Oh well, not as lovely as you. I mean, I can't believe that you would have a thirty-year-old daughter! And you! I can't believe that you would have a tux that's thirty years old!
It's older than that. Ross was actually conceived right near this tuxedo.
Ohh!
Hey! Everybody hide! Hide! I saw her! She's coming!
Okay! Okay! Everybody down! Everybody down!
Crap.
Okay, everybody stay here. I will find out what's going on.
Heyyy!! You got the door open!!
Hey-hey are you drunk?
Nooo! Okay. Whoa! Okay. See I was, I was a little nervous about turning thirty. So the bus boys took me out for some drinks. I wanna puke on you later!
Okay, here is the thing. We have thrown a very formal surprise party for you in there! All of your friends are in there and your parents!
Noo!!!
Yes!
Noo!!
Yes!!
Oh no! My parents have never seen me drunk! That they know of.
Okay, here's the thing. We're gonna get you some coffee and they will never know that you're drunk.
Really?! You promise?
Yeah, I'll take care of it.
Okay. I love you so much.
Okay we have to do something about your breath.
What about your breath?!
That's still yours. Okay, now remember it's a surprise party. So, when you go in, act surprised.
Okay. I can do that.
Okay.
Surprise!!!
Okay, forward. Forward-Stop! Okay, back-Stop! Okay, forward-Stop! Stop! Stop!
Ross, just forget about it. This guy's got you totally wedged in.
Is this yours?
Well actually...
No-no-no! It's mine! It's-it's mine.
Dude, you soooo need this car.
Okay. Okay, here's what we're gonna do. Okay, I'm gonna break into this mini-van and put it in neutral. You guys push it forward so Ross can drive out of his spot. Okay? All right, here we go. Haul ass!!!!
Happy thirtieth birthday! Here! It's for the child in you, and the woman. Happy thirtieth!
Right, why do you keep saying that?
Because it's our thirtieth birthday.
Yeah, no we're not thirty. We're 31. Okay.
Wait!
Oh, it's you.
Yeah. What?!
Yeah, we're not thirty, we're 31.
Nu-uh!
Yea-huh! That's what is says on my birth certificate.
You have your birth certificate?
Yeah, I got a big box of family stuff when my mom died.
Our mom.
Right! Okay.
Do you have my birth certificate?
No, I sold it to a Swedish runaway.
Oh my God! Oh my God, we are 31.
Yeah.
I just lost a whole year of my life.
Okay.
Your middle name is Pamela?
Yes.
Well, I never knew mine. Do you remember what it is?
Yes! Phoebe.
That's my first name.
Right, okay, then no.
Okay before we start the celebration, Monica has to go put on her party dress.
Yay!
See? Here we go.
Happy birthday, sweetie! Give us a hug!
Don't get up Jack! The safety pins are about to blow.
Paul!
Phil.
Phil!
Now, there is a dress laid out on your bed. Okay, you're doing great. You're doing great. You're doing fine.
Hey, what's going on?
Monica's a little drunk.
Yay! I love drunk Monica!
Awwwww...
Go change! She doesn't want her parents to know she's drunk.
Ohh! All right! All right. Here's what we'll do, I'll get twice as drunk as Monica and then no one's will even notice her.
What's-what's going on? Phil's really pissed!
Monica's wasted.
Maybe that will liven up this party.
Okay, will you just go help her change please!
Okay, but taking care of a drunk, naked woman seems like a job for Joey.
Yep.
This one's from me.
Ahh!
It wasn't on your list, but hopefully you'll think it's really fun.
A scooter!
Stick to the list. Always stick to the list.
No! No-no, I love it. Thank you.
Okay, open ours next. Open ours next!
Okay.
Now that you're a couple, we don't get two presents from you guys?
For my last birthday you gave me a hug! Okay, read the card! Read the card!
Okay. Happy birthday Grandma! It's better to be over the hill then buried under it. All our love Monica and Chandler. That's funny, yeah!
No-no-no-no! That was the joke!
No, I know! I get it! It's funny!
No, because you're not a grandmother!
No I know, because to be a grandmother you have to be married and have children and I don't have any of those things. That's why it's so funny.
All you had to do was buy the card!
Hey! Look who's back! It's the birthday girl! How's the birthday girl feeling?
Well, I feel fine, but I think you're bumming out the rest of the kids.
What?
Okay! Y'know what? I realized it was stupid to get upset about not having a husband and kids. All I really needed was a plan. See I wanna have three kids...
Oh let me guess, and you wanna have them all at the same time and you wanna have them for your brother.
As I was saying... I should probably have the first of the three kids by the time I'm 35 which gives me five years. I love this plan! I wanna marry this plan!
If you could do that, I'd marry the hippity-hop.
So, if I wanna have my kid when I'm 35, I don't have to get pregnant until I'm 34. Which gives Prada four years to start making maternity clothes! Oh wait, but I do want to be married for a year before I get pregnant...
Really! That long?! Look all you want, it's happening!
No, so I don't have to get married until I'm 33! That's three years, that's three whole years-Oh, wait a minute though. I'll need a year and a half to plan the wedding, and I'd like to know the guy for a year, year and a half before we get engaged... Which means I need to meet the guy by the time I'm thirty.
Which is fine! Because you just turned--twenty-eight!
No! Ross, no! It is not fine! Eh-eh-according to my plan I should already be with the guy I wanna marry!
Will you quit hoggin' it!
I'm telling you it's like watching Bambi learn how to walk.
You're drunk! Mom and dad are gonna be maaaaadd! Maybe I'm a little drunk.
Oh that's great! Right there! Can we get some of that over here please? There we go.
Hey! Are those crab cakes? Did I not tell ya to come straight to me when more crab cakes were ready?
How are you feeling?
You are so handsome! I wanna make love to you right here, right now!
I really wish that you wouldn't.
Now all you have to do is just get through a little bit more, okay? Then we can put you in bed, okay? Just smile and don't talk to anyone.
Speech! Speech! Let's hear from the birthday girl! Huh?
Pheebs!!
Don't you see? Everyone's looking at me! The plan's working! I didn't even have to take off my top yet!
Speech! Come on Monica!
Come on!
Come on! Speech!
Hey Chandler, you can't keep your hands off her for one second!
Oh-ho, I think it's nice.
I think it's necessary.
I-I-I wanna thank you all for coming. My family and my friends...
Wooo!! Hoo!!
I really like to say that I'm-um... Y'know what I'd really like to say? I'm drunk!! That's right mom and dad your little Harmonica is hammered!! And guess what! I've been drunk before! And I've smoked a cigarette! And I got a box of Ding-Dongs hidden in my underwear drawer! It's all okay. It's okay because I turned thirty today. And, and I can do anything I want! Because I am a grown up.
Okay quick, help me get this off!
Yeah!!
I lost a whole year! I can't believe it! This is so unfair!
Oh, I don't know Pheebs. It'll be okay.
Will it? Will it?! I mean, how would you feel if you found out you were 31?
That's not gonna happen. No. Because we have a new deal!
Plus, it totally ruined my schedule! I...I haven't done any of the things I wanted to do by the time I was 31!
Like what?
Like okay I-I-I, I haven't met any Portuguese people! I, I haven't had the perfect kiss! And I haven't been to sniper's school!
Phoebe, y'know why don't we just go upstairs and have some birthday cake?
No, I just feel like being by myself for a while. All right? I'll see you guys later. Thanks.
Hey. Oh, poor Pheebs.
Hey, y'know what you guys? I think I'm gonna go walk her home.
Oh man!
What?
He's gonna eat the cake!
Pheebs! Wait up! Listen uh, close your eyes. Maybe that's one thing you can cross off your list.
Oh yeah.
Oh, and plus I'm 1/16th Portuguese.
Oh!
Okay, is everybody clear? We're gonna pick it up...and move it. Now all we need is teamwork, okay? We're gonna lift the car...and slide it out. Lift and slide!
Ross, I really don't think...
Lift!! And slide!
Okay, here we go.
All right everyone, lift! And slide!!
Hey Joey, can I...
Oh, come on Rach! My turn just started!
Actually, I just wanna talk to Tag.
Oh. Okay. Hey, can I ride this outside?
Whatever! Okay, I'm not your mother.
Okay!
Not in the street!!
Yes!
Hi.
Hey.
Hey.
How are you doing? Are you feeling any better?
Yeah, I'm doing okay. I'm um...let's talk.
Okay.
Umm...
What's up?
Ohh Tag, umm...you're such a great guy and we have sooo much fun together but I don't-I don't...
Wait! I think I see where you're going, but before you say anything else, can I just say one more thing?
Well said. And a uh good example of the fun I was referring to uhh, but I just think I'm past the point where I think I can y'know, just have fun.
Rachel, don't do this. This is just because you're turning thirty.
Yeah, it is! But you're just a kid! I mean you're 25!
Twenty-four actually.
Oh God! Y'know what I wish? I wish you were six years older. Well actually, if I'm wishin' for stuff, I actually wish I was six years younger.
Me too.
Yeah, I'm sorry.
Hey! How'd it go?
Oh, if I only want two kids, can I keep him for another year?
You did the right thing.
I don't like this anymore.
Well, here we are, just a bunch of thirty year olds.
God, do you realize in ten years we're gonna be 40?
Why God?! Why are you doing this to us?!
Yes! My baby's finally free!
All-all right! Start it up! Let's go!
Woohoo!
How hot are we?
You wanna buy a car?
No.
I'm glad you're here, we have a couple of things to ask you about the wedding ceremony.
Ohh...
What's the matter? You okay?
Yeah, it's just y'know...
Monica said wedding.
Uh, so anyway, we thought one of you could read something during the ceremony.
Oh! I would love to read a poem.
Do you think you could get through a poem?
It'll be a short one.
Okay, so Ross will be doing the reading.
Ohhh...
Okay. Yeah, I guess, I guess I could do that too.
Too?
Yeah, I kind of uh, have something else planned for you guys.
Do you mind telling us what it is?
Sorry, I'm kinda keeping this one on the Q.T.
Well, whatever it is, I hope it involves winking.
Hey!
Hey!
So I just talked to one of the DOOL writers today, and...
What is DOOL?
Days Of Our Lives. Anyway, you're not gonna believe it! My character is coming out of his coma!!
Oh!!
That's great!
And-and-and not only that, I'm gettin' a new brain!!
So great things are happening at work and in your personal life!
Wait, what do you mean you're getting a new brain?
Oh well, they're killing off one of the characters on the show, and when she dies her brain is being transplanted into my body.
What? A brain transplant?!
Yes, it's a highly controversial procedure.
It's ridiculous!
Well, I think it's ridiculous that you haven't had sex in three and a half months.
It's winter, they are fewer people on the street.
Who are they killing off?
Uh Cecilia Monroe, she plays Jessica Lockhart.
Noo!!
She's my favorite character on DOOL.
Nice.
She is so good at throwing drinks in people's faces, I mean I don't think I've ever seen her finish a beverage.
And the way she slaps all the time!
Oh!
Wouldn't you love to do it just once?!
Don't do it.
Cecilia Monroe man, what a great actress.
Oh, tell me about it. And she's been on the show forever, it's gonna be really hard to fill her shoes.
Yeah-yeah, help me out here, when you come out of the "brain transplant," you are going to be her?
Yes, but in Drake Remoray's body. Why is this so hard for you to get? I thought you were a scientist!
Rach, so, that guy there. Straight or gay?
Well, I'd have to say gay.
Yeah? Why?
Well mainly because he's kissing that other guy.
Oh no not that guy there. That guy right there.
Oh yeah he's too cute to be straight.
Ohh knockers will help us figure it out.
All right, straight, and not subtle.
Ohh, he left his cell phone.
Oh, well, we can hand it to Gunther and he'll put it in lost and found.
Or we could use it to call China. See how those guys are doing.
What if, um, if he calls his own cell phone to find out who found it and I answer and we start talking and we fell in love. I mean wouldn't that be a great story? Kind of like a fairy tale for the digital age.
Yeah... That does sound great. I'm going to get the phone.
What? Wait! Why...why do you get the story?
I don't know. I haven't been out on a date in so long.
Phoebe, you had a date three days ago.
That wasn't a date! That was, that was just friends getting together... having sex.
Okay. Okay, see? I get the phone.
No way! No way! You just broke with Tag a week ago.
Yeah! And until now, I didn't think I'd love again.
Nice try.
Oh hey-hey wait! How do we fairly decide who gets the phone?
I don't know.
Well umm, maybe we could uhh... Ah-ha! Too slow!!
Ah-ha! Too cocky!
I'm going to keep dating him Mother, and there's nothing you can do about it!
Oh yes there is!
What are you going to do? Kill him? Like you did with Charles?!
That was an accident! And so were you.
Well, at least I'm not a murderer!
Oh, my baby!
Cut!
That was a great scene! And-and-and that slap looks so real! How do you do that?
Oh, just years of experience.
Can I get some ice here?!
Oh anyway, I just wanted to say how wonderful I think you are.
You're not the fan who's dying are you?
Say what?
I'm supposed to meet and hug a fan whose dying, but that's not supposed to be until later!
No. No, I'm Joey Tribbiani; we did a scene together yesterday. I-I'm the guy in the coma!
Oh that was a real person?!
An-an-anyway I-I just wanted to say that since I'm getting your brain when you leave the show, I was wondering if there was any tips you can give me...
I-I-I'm leaving the show?
I don't know. Why? Did you hear something?
Who told you that?
Oh uh, one of the writers.
Which one? Was it bald or was it tall?
Umm...
Y'know what? It doesn't matter! Because it is not true!
Okay.
And if it were true, how dare you come to me ask me for tips about a character that I've been playing for 20 years-I'll give you a tip!
Ms. Monroe... Oh there you go.
No Phoebe! You cannot get the phone that way; that's not fair! Okay look, I have an idea. Why don't we, why don't we see what kind of number he has on his speed dial, and then from that we can tell who has more in common with him. And then whoever does gets the phone.
Or, we can decide by whose ever name is closer to the word phone.
I don't think so.
Fine all right, but I'd bet you'd be singing another tune if we were fighting over a ratchet.
All right, first name on the speed dial is mom.
Ohh, I lost my mom to suicide.
Okay no way, you cannot use that to get the cute guy and the last blueberry muffin.
Did I use that already today? I'm sorry.
Yes okay. Well now see this isn't telling us anything. Joe. Carlos. Peter. Ooh! Peter Luger! T hat's a steak house!
Okay, a meat eater. Fine, that's one for you.
Oh, I win! He's got Barney's on his speed dial.
So you don't know that's Barney's the store! That can be y'know his friend's house, or a bar. Who has Barney's the store on their speed dial?
His new girlfriend!
What is that?
I think it's the dying cat parade.
It sounds like it's coming from across the street.
Oh my God!
What?
Y'know that thing that Ross was gonna do at our wedding?! He was hanging out with me yesterday and he turned to me and said, "You're half Scottish right?"
Nooo!!
Yes!!
No, there is no way! It can not be Ross! Unbelievable! Why is your family Scottish?!
Why is your family Ross?!
He cannot play at our wedding! I mean everyone will leave! I mean come on, that is just noise! It's not even a song!
If you listen very carefully, I think its Celebration by Cool and the Gang.
Hi Pheebs!
Hi!
How are ya?
Good.
Umm Pheebs, remember when we were in the coffee house we decided that I was going to keep the uh, the cute guy's cell phone?
Yeah.
And remember how I said I was going to keep it in my purse so that if it rang I could just pick it up?
Yeah!
And do you remember going into my purse and stealing the phone?!
Ooh, now you lost me.
You stole the phone!
No I didn't!
No? So you're saying that if I called it, it wouldn't ring?
No.
Umm, okay. But while you dial, let me show you the features of my new ringing handbag. Oh, it does work!
Phoebe!
That is a different phone.
Oh is it?! Uhh, hello? Yes hi, is Rachel there? Yes she is, just one moment please. It's for me!
That is damning evidence.
Oh my God! I bet that's him. My digital fairy tale is about to begin. I wonder how I should be? Should I be uh Hello? Or should I be Hi! It's Rach... Would you stop doing that?!
Hello? Yes, I'm the one who found your phone.
Phoebe! You can't do th...
Shhh! I'm on a call! Umm well yeah, you can pick it up tonight, say 8:30? At-at my apartment. It's umm, it's umm 5 Morton Street, Apartment 14, umm and then maybe y'know after we can grab a bite to eat or whatever. Okay, well okay I'll see you then. Bye.
You do know that I will be here when he comes over.
Oh? And how will you know what time to come over?
You just said it!
Oh. Okay, well I-I was kinda hoping that I would just...be alone y'know to think about my mom and her suicide.
Oh Phoebe!
What?! That's the first time today!
Ohh!
So you like the nachos uh? Myself I'm partial to...
I'm 16.
See you in 2003.
You're absolutely right they are writing me out of the show. They don't know exactly when it's going to happen, but apparently going to be very soon and that's it.
I'm so sorry. Look, if it was up to me you would never leave the show.
Yeah, thanks.
No I mean it! I can't believe they would do this to you! And to your fans! I mean they are going to be devastated! Heart broken! They love you so much!
Oh you're right. Thank you! What's your name again?
Joey.
Joey, well thank you. That is so sweet. Oh, excuse me.
It wasn't my decision!
I'm having a conversation here! You were saying?
Uh yeah-ye-ye-ye-ye-ye-l-l-l-l-l-look the-the-the only reason that I, that I came up to you before was because well, I'm really nervous about-about being you. Y'know if you can help me capture the essence of the character. Y'know? Help me keep Jessica alive. Please?
All right Joey, I will help you. Not because I-I owe it to this stupid show, but because I owe it to Jessica.
Oh that's great! Oh thank you so much!
You're so welcome.
Hey! Now, I've been watching some tapes, how's this? "Jessica Lockhart will never step foot in this place again! Ever!!"
Is that supposed to be me?
Yeah.
Yeah but Jessica doesn't have an English accent.
I can do an English accent?! That baby's going on my resume!
Well, I feel like a snack!
Do you want some shortbread? Eh that's Scottish like you are.
Oh no thanks. I don't like any thing from my Scottish heritage.
What?!
Well it's just my entire family was run out of Scotland by...Vikings. Anyway, lots of bad memories.
Oh well, it sounds to me like your family is ready to uh, rediscover its Scottish roots.
No! No-no they're not. They're still very angry! But y'know Chandler is also half-Swedish. You know what the Swedish people are famous for? Sitting down and being quiet.
Well yeah-yeah the Scottish history is so much more...
You can not play bagpipes at the wedding!!
How did you know about that?!
We heard you play all the way from your apartment!
Were you the ones called the cops?!
That's not really important right now. What is important is; while we appreciate the gesture, we just don't feel bagpipes are appropriate for our wedding.
Why not?
Because we hate them.
Come on that's not fair! I mean you haven't even heard me play!
We have heard you play.
No, you've heard my practice. Okay? Just-just give me a chance to perform for you and then decide whatever you want. And I'm not going to tell you what song I'm gonna play either. But uh, let's just say when it's over I'll bet there will be a we bit o' celebration.
So, the essence of the character is rooted in her confidence. So, when Jessica enters a room for instance, she owns everything and every person in that room. You try.
Okay! All right!
No, he already knows that he owns everything in the room! He's not finding it out for the first time! So, try it again.
Okay. Okay.
Right. He's not angry at the room either. Try it again, he owns it! He owns the room. It is his. He owns, owns, owns, owns the room! He owns it!! All right, it's a little weird, but it's getting better. Oh well, I'm gonna miss this woman so much. I don't know what I'm going to do! I mean, it's been 20 years of my life.
Oh well-Hey-hey! Maybe, maybe uh, maybe this is a good thing. Y'know? It'll-it'll give you a chance to shake things up, play different characters. You're so talented.
I am. I am, but I don't know you know. An actor of a certain age is not that easy.
Hey that's not true! Look at uh, look at Angela Lansb-Angelina Jolie!
I probably should've just left years ago when the offers were pouring in, but y'know I just got so comfy here! And... Ohh, I turned down some amazing work!
Like-like what?
Well, let's just say if I left 15 years ago, the landscape of Mexican cinema would be very different today!
Wow!
But... Well now, now's a different time for me.
Oh hey come on, don't-don't-don't do this! Umm, look let-let me tell you something, okay? Now when I watch you do a scene, I'm thinking, "Boy, she-she is a great actress!" Uh but-but, I am also thinking, "She is hot!"
You think I'm hot?
You own the room. We should probably get-get uh...
Oh yeah-yeah, we should get the... So when Jessica kisses a man, she usually puts umm, both her hands on the man's face.
Yeah-yeah, I noticed that! Is that 'cause she's so passionate?
No! It's because that way the camera only sees her! Do you wanna try it?
Yeah! Okay.
That was good, that was really good. But I-I think your hands maybe a little off, they should be maybe right like...
Hey! Hey!
Who is it?
Hi! It's Tom, I'm here to pick up the phone.
Whoa! Why do you get to answer the door?
Well why shouldn't I?!
Because it's my apartment!
Well, then I get to give him the cell phone.
Okay. All right. Good luck explaining all the calls to China.
Hi!
Wow! How long were we arguing for?
You're not the man who left the cell phone.
No that's my assistant.
Is-is he coming?
Umm, no.
Could you-could you umm, give us one second?
Sure!
We'll be right back sir.
Sure.
Wh-what do we do?
I don't know!
Can you believe this? We were waiting for a hot guy and then an even hotter one shows up!
I know! What?!
Hmm, they just don't make 'em like that anymore!
No-no they do but, you just have to wait.
Rachel, listen-I mean, if you let me have him then I will really owe you one.
All right. All right Phoebe I will let you have him, but you owe me; you owe me big!
Yeah! You're such a great friend!
Ohh...
So, which one of you lovely ladies am I going to take to dinner huh?
Oh that'd be me. Sir. After you.
Okay. Okay.
Nice!
Well, you certainly own that room.
Actually I rent the whole place and, I just got what you meant. Thank you.
Hi.
Hey!
Oh my God! Oh my God!! Ohh, Jessica Lockhart!! In my apartment!! I am such a huge fan! I am such a huge fan!
Well, it's nice to know that you...
MONICA!!!! MONICA!!!!
That uh, that is my roommate Rachel.
Oh that explains all the women's underwear.
Sure. Yep.
Oh my God! It's true!! Oh my God you are so amazing! Oh my God, can I just ask you to do me oh, just one favor?
Certainly.
Would you slap me? Would you slap me right here in the face?!
I'd love to, but my lawyer said I can't do that anymore.
God. You seem really, really nice.
Okay, bye-bye.
I mean n-not-not fake at all like most famous people.
All right, here we go.
Okay.
Oh wait, just one more thing! One more minute! Umm, you're a stupid bitch.
I really can't slap you.
You are so beautiful.
Nice to meet you! My God you're great!
Thanks for stopping by. See ya! I-I am so sorry. I...
Oh no-no-no-no, being adored. I'm used to it, don't worry about it.
Oh my God!
What?
They sent me today's script! They never send the script!
They don't?
Well no, I'm just in a coma. This must mean I have lines! Oh...
How does it happen?
Ew, you get thrown from a horse into an electric fence.
Ah what?! Jessica hates horses!
Yeah well, I'm guessing after this she's not going to be crazy about electricity either.
...now remember you have to imagine me in a kilt.
I can imagine you in a short plaid skirt and knee socks.
Do you wanna start telling secrets?
No!
Now umm, remember I'm still learning.
One, two, three, four!
You know the song! Sing along!
So?
No!
Loosening the saddle on mother's horse was brilliant Fredrick. And the electric fence, inspired.
Thank you sweetheart.
I can't believe she's really gone. Look around you, all of this is ours.
I don't think so.
Who are you?!
What's the matter Dina? Don't you recognize your own mother?!
Cut! That was great everybody! Thank you!
That was so wonderful! Ohh, I think that you're a better Jessica than I ever was!
Oh noo...
Well of course not, but you were very good.
Thanks!
And guess what? Good news! I got another job!
Great! Hey! All right! Well-well what is it?!
A film in Guadalajara!
The airport?
No that's La Guardia. This is Mexico.
Ohh. Wow! Well how-how, how will you be gone?
Eight months.
That's a really long time.
Yeah, but you can come and visit me. I bet that you could uh, own a few places down there.
Well I tell ya, I should probably buy a place in the city first. And I just got what you meant again-That is-I tell ya, that is a tricky one!
That is a tricky one. Well, Joey I really wanna thank you. You've, well you made a very difficult time for me a little less painful.
Good luck.
You too.
You know the song! Sing along!
Eeee!!! Eee!! Eee!!
Eee!!
Do it again!
Hi.
Hi! Hi Ben!
Hi.
Hi, we have a little bathroom emergency.
Oh, yeah go ahead.
Uh, before we do uh, are any of Joey's special romance magazines in there?
No. No.
Okay! All clear!
Thanks Phoebe!
Ben, its Rachel! But whatever.
Everything okay in there?
Don't talk to me now!
Awww, just like his daddy.
Hey listen can you do me a big favor? The dean's office just called and said there was an urgent meeting. Can you watch Ben for like an hour?
What-what about Monica?
Oh, she isn't home.
So it would just be, me alone?
Well, Ben would be there.
Huh umm...
What's the matter?
Well that-y'know it's just uh, I've never done that before. Me and him alone.
Rach, he's not an ex-con.
Okay. Okay. Okay. Uh, what do I, what do I do with him?
I don't know! Just-just talk to him-entertain him and keep him alive.
Okay.
Okay. Ben? Come here. All right, I'm gonna leave you here with Aunt Rachel for about an hour. Okay? Are you gonna be okay?
Yeah I think so.
I wasn't talking to you.
I'll be okay.
Okay, I'll see you soon buddy. Be back in an hour.
Bye dad.
Bye. Ahhh... So this is fun, huh?
Not really.
Okay. Uh, want something-want something to drink?
Okay.
Uh great! How do you feel about Diet Coke?
I'm not allowed to have soda.
Okay. Well that's pretty much all that we have-Oh! Oh! Have you ever had a virgin margarita?
What's a virgin?
Water it is.
What about the second minister we meet with? I kinda liked him.
You mean the spitter?
Come on! It wasn't that bad!
Easy for you to say; you'll be wearing a veil.
All right, what about the third guy?
You mean the guy who kept staring at your chest?
Can you blame him?
Sorry, I just don't like the idea of when I say, "I do," he's thinking, "Yeah, I'd do her too!"
Well then we still have a problem.
Yeah!
With what?
Well, we're trying to find someone to perform our wedding and they're all either boring or annoying or y'know, can't stop staring at the ladies.
Oo! You should have one of us do it!
Phoebe, we're getting married, married; not sixth grade married.
No! No! It's-it's uh a real thing! Anyone can get ordained on the Internet and perform like weddings and stuff!
Are you serious?
Yes! A friend of mine did it and it's totally legal!
I call it!!
What?! No! It was my idea!
Guys thank you very much but neither of you is marrying us.
Does calling it not mean anything anymore?!
We are going to have a legitimate member of the clergy! And when I say legitimate I mean, gay and in control of his saliva!
Ben y'know when uh, when you were a baby, you and I used to hang out all the time. 'Cause I was, I was your daddy's girlfriend.
But you're not anymore!
No, I'm not.
'Cause you guys were on a break.
Hey! We were not on a-Okay. That's fine! Fine. Y'know what Ben? One day when you are a lot older I am going to tell you that entire story over a pitcher of real margaritas, okay?
When's my daddy coming back?
Fifty-two minutes. So no-no brothers and sisters, huh? That must be nice. You don't have to share stuff.
Sharing is good.
Oh, you're one of those. But y'know what? I have two sisters of my own and we just-just tortured each other.
Really? Like how?
Well y'know, we would umm, repeat everything the other said, or uh, we'd jump out of closets to scare each other, or switch the sugar for the salt so they'd put salt on their cereal.
That's a good one.
Yeah? You like that one?
Yeah, you're funny.
I'm funny? Oh thank God! Well hey, I've got a ton of these! Umm, oh hear-Do you want a good one? Here's a good one. Umm, you uh, you take a quarter, take a quarter and, and you blacken the edge. Right? And then you say to person, I bet you can't roll this quarter from your forehead to your chin without it leaving your face. And then when they do it, they're left with a big black pencil line right down the center of their face.
Can I do it to you?
Yeah, I-I-I-I'm funny Ben, but I'm not stupid. Okay?
So, did you uh, find anyone to marry you guys yet?
No, but Horny for Monica Minister called, wanting to know if we were still together.
We're never gonna find anybody.
Well then let me do it!
Joe...
No-no-no! Look, I've been thinking about it. I'm an actor right? So I won't get nervous talking in front of people.
Joey look it's really sweet...
No-no-no-no look no! I won't spit, and I won't stare at Monica's breasts! Y'know? Everyone knows I'm an ass man!
That is true.
Yeah and the most important thing is that it won't be some like, stranger up there who barely knows you. It'll be me! And I swear I'll do a really good job. Plus, y'know I love you guys and-and it would really mean a lot to me.
Y'know, we haven't found anybody else.
It might be kinda cool.
So I can do it?
Yeah you can do it.
All right!!! Okay!! All right! Okay-okay, I gotta get started on my speech! Oh, wait a minute, Internet ministers can still have sex right?
Yeah.
Okay.
Hey Pheebs, how's it going?
Oh, I have a headache. A horrible headache!
Oh, I'm sorry. Can I get you something?
Oh my God, you've got to stop chattering!
Here, take a couple of these.
What is it?
It's Hexadrin.
Oh no, I don't believe in Western medicine. No, if you just apply pressure to these points right here. Then your hand starts to hurt and you still have a headache, so thanks.
Okay, while we're waiting for these pills to kick in, I'm gonna sit you down on the couch. Come on. Get some nice soft pillows under your head, I'm gonna turn the TV on and you can watch whatever you want. And I'm-Sit down--gonna make you some tea. And then, I'm gonna rub your feet.
Oh.
Oh! My head! Oh! Oh!
Coming.
I have a bone to pick with you.
Uh-oh.
Yes! Ben learned a little trick.
Oh yeah? Did he pull the old...
That's right! That's right! Saran Wrap on the toilet seat so the pee goes everywhere!
Oh that.
Yeah that! You know I hate practical jokes! They're mean and they're stupid and-and I don't want my son learning them!
Oh, come on! Saran Wrap on the toilet seat, you don't think that's just a little funny?!
I was barefoot. Now tell me, the toilet thing is the only thing you taught him right?
Yes.
It's amazing! My headache is completely gone! What are those pills called?
Hexadrin.
Oh, I love you Hexadrin! Oh look! It comes with a story!
No Phoebe, those are like the side affects and stuff.
Say what?
Y'know, the possible side affects.
Oh my God! Dizziness, nervousness, drowsiness, facial swelling, nausea, headache-Headache. Vomiting, stomach bleeding, liver damage! Now okay, I don't recall any of this coming up when you gave me these little death capsules! Oh I'm sorry, extra strength death capsules!
Phoebe, relax none of that stuff ever happens! They just put it on there for legal reasons!
Why?
In case it happens.
Hey!
Hey!
Say hello to Reverend Joey Tribbiani!
Hey!
You did it! You got ordained?!
Yeah, I just got off the Internet! Man, there is a lot of porn out there!
Our minister...
I have liver damage. Ow! Oh!
Phoebe, your liver is right here.
Okay, then I must be disoriented.
Anyway, I started working on what I'm going to say for the ceremony, do you wanna hear it?
Okay.
Yeah!
Now-now, listen this is just a first draft so... "We are gathered here today on this joyous occasion to celebrate the special love that Monica and Chandler share." Eh? "It is a love based on giving and receiving. As well as having and sharing. And the love that they give and have is shared and received. And through this having and giving and sharing and receiving." "We too can share and love and have and receive."
Should we call the spitter?
Hey Rachel!
Hi!
What a nice surprise! What are you doing here?
Well y'know I was just in the neighborhood and I passed by your building and I thought to myself, "What's up with Carol and sweet, little Ben?"
Can I ask what-Come on in.
Okay.
Umm uh, I'll make some coffee and we can uh, chat.
I'd love that. I would loooove... So uh, so where is sweet little Ben? I would love to have a little...
Gotcha!!
I found him! Very funny, come here! That is exactly why I've come here to talk to you okay?
Rach, do you want some sugar in your coffee?
Yes oh--Do I want sugar in my coffee? No, just some milk would be good Carol. Thanks. Okay, do you remember all that stuff I taught you yesterday?
Remember all that stuff I taught you yesterday?
Don't do that.
Don't do that.
Seriously, your dad doesn't like pranks.
Seriously, your dad doesn't like pranks.
Oh damnit!
Oh damnit!
No! Don't say that! Don't say that!
Damnit!
No don't! Go back to repeating!
Damnit!
Oh crap!
Oh crap!
I feel like my face is swelling. Is my face swelling?
Phoebe, your face is fine! Come on, none of this stuff is going to happen to you! Stop being such a baby!
Oh, interesting you should call me that! Now that I may never have one!
Okay you guys, I got a little more written. Are you ready?
Yeah. O-okay.
"When I think of the love that these two givers and receivers share, I can not help but envy the lifetime ahead of having and loving and giving and..." And then I can't think of a good word for right here.
How about receiving?
Yes!
See Joe, not that that's not grrreat! But, one of the cool things about having somebody we know perform the ceremony is that it can be about us! Y'know, it can be more personal. You can tell stories about us!
Ooh, like the time you and I went to Atlantic City and I made you laugh so hard you threw up your whole steak?! Remember?
No, not us... Us!
I gotcha. Sorry. So, did you ever make him throw up a whole anything?
Did you ever feed him a poison capsule that made him bleed from the eyes?
It doesn't say that!
Oh! Suddenly somebody knows all about the side affects!
See Joe, we want you to tell stories but y'know, romantic stories. Nice stories.
Oh. Okay. Ooh! Ooh! Okay, maybe I'll talk about London! Y'know when you two hooked up! Only, only I won't say hooked up. I'll say, "Began their beautiful journey..."
There you go!
"...by doin' it."
Joe?
Okay. All right. Umm, so uh, so how did it happen? Did your eyes meet across the room? And then the next thing y'know you're in the bathtub together and she's feeding you strawberries?
Isn't that what happened with you and the bride's maid?
Yeah!! I call that London style.
No that is not what happened with us. Well, I was umm, I was really sad that night because this guy that I was Ross's mom.
Oh.
And then Chandler was, was really sweet and he consoled me. And well we drank too much...
Yeah baby!
And I was a perfect gentleman and I walked her to her hotel room and said goodnight.
Oh.
But then later that night...
Yeah baby!
Hey!
Cute PJ's! You're really livin' it up here in London huh?
Well I was... I was exactly expecting company after... 9:15.
Is Joey here?
Well, last time I saw him he was heading out the door with the bride's maid and a bucket of strawberries. So uh, you're not still upset about what that guy told ya are ya?
Wouldn't you be?
Well, look it's been a really emotional time y'know, and you've had a lot to drink. And you've just got to let that go okay? I mean you were the most beautiful in the room tonight!
Really?
You kidding? You're the most beautiful woman in most rooms... Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What's going on? You and I just made out! You and I are making out?
Well, not anymore.
But we don't do that.
I know, I just thought it would be fun.
How drunk are you?
Drunk enough to know that I want to do this. Not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage.
That's the perfect amount!
Okay!
Y'know what's weird?
What?
This doesn't feel weird!
I know.
You're a really good kisser.
Well, I have kissed over four women. Do you wanna get under the covers?
Hm-hmm!
Okay!
Wow! You are really fast!
It bodes well for me that speed impresses you.
We're gonna see each other naked.
Yep!
Do you wanna do it at the same time?
Count of three?
One!
Two!
Two!
Three!
Well I think it's safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined.
Eh, we weren't that close anyway!
Eh!
Joey! Joey! Joey! J-J-Joey-Joey-J-Joey!
Hey!
Hey Joe! I was just watching a movie-e-e...
Oh, dude I'm so sorry!
No! No! No!
Hey no-no-no-no! It's cool! It's cool! I-I'll only be a second, I'm still with my bride's maid, I just-Where are those condoms you brought?
They're in my bag over there.
Ah.
Uh, could you leave me one?
For just you?
Yeah.
Hey listen, why don't you come downstairs with me? There's some really nice girls down there.
No I-I-I'm fine.
All right, here you go buddy. Go nuts.
That's what that was?! 'Cause that other thing? I thought you were on to something, but it did nothing for me.
Okay, can we change the topic? Because it's really doing nothing for me.
Oh... Can you imagine if I hadn't left you that last one? You two might've never gotten together. Ooh-ooh! Could you imagine if I sent that hooker up to the room like I was gonna?! It's like it was in the stars!
Yeah, it's totally meant to be. Tell him who you originally wanted to hook up with that night.
What?!
What?
What?!
Who did you originally want to hook up with?
Okay, fine but please don't be upset! Okay? I was really depressed okay? And really drunk! I just wanted something stupid and meaningless. I just wanted...just sex. So, when I...went to your room that night...I was actually looking...for Joey.
Yeah baby! No baby!
So you came to the room looking for Joey? Did you ever in-intend on telling me about this?
No because it-it didn't seem important.
Oh, it's not important? It's not important?! If it wasn't for a bride's maid you'd be marrying him not me!
Noo!! The point is that is was you that was there that night! It is you that I am marrying! It is you that I feel in love with!
And it is a love that is based on having and giving and receiv-
I don't believe it. The most romantic night of my life and I'm runner up.
Chandler, please! Do you know how unbelievably glad I am that Joey was not there that night?!
Hey! Now I'm a man of the cloth, but I still have feelings!
Look there is no way you're doing this wedding now. Okay?
What?! That's not fair! It's not my fault! I was off with my bride's maid! And who's to say I would've even said yes?! I mean I would've said yes. Chandler look y-y-you are making way to big a deal out of this, all right? Look, everything worked out okay!
Okay, it's just weird! Okay? I don't want to be standing their saying my vows and then having the mental image of you and Monica! I-I-I need...I don't know what I need. I need a walk.
Wait Chandler come on, let's-it's not a big deal!
It is to me. You wanted to sleep with Batman, and instead you had to settle for Robin.
This is crazy.
I know! Robin is so gay!
So now what have we agreed?
No more pranks.
And-and what else?
That you and daddy were not on a break.
Very good.
Rachel! What are you doing here?
I'm just visiting my good friend Carol.
Your good friend?
Yeah!
What's her last name?
Carol...Lesbian?
Nice. And by the way that uh, that line down my face?
What line?
Wh-wh-what line? The line that prompted a student in my last class of the day to say uh, "Dude, don't you ever was your face?"
All right, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I didn't tell you but you were so mad already!
Of course I was mad! I told you I-I hate this stuff! Okay? It-it's not funny!
Hey Ross!
Hi.
What's not funny?
Practical jokes.
Oh I...I think they're funny.
You have a line down your face.
What?
Okay, maybe they are not funny to you...
Oh my God!
Or Carol! But they're funny to kids and who is it hurting?!
Uh, y'know what? I'll tell you who it hurts! It hurts the kid who has all his clothes stolen in gym class so he has to go to the principal's office wearing nothing but a catcher's mitt!
That was you?! We heard about you in Junior High! Did you really just shake your fist in the air and shout, "I will be revenged?!"
I will be! Listen, I don't want you teaching my son that stuff anymore. Okay?
Fine. Fine, but I'll have you know that once I taught him that stuff he called me Fun Aunt Rachel. And I loved being Fun Aunt Rachel but I'll go back to being Boring and Uncomfortable Aunt Rachel if that's what you want!
No that's not what I want. Uh, I'm glad you guys were bonding but I...
Look he doesn't have any brothers or sisters, somebody's gonna have to teach him this stuff! And I haven't taught him anything that a normal 6-year-old doesn't know anyway!
Crap!!
I gotta go!
Hey.
Hey. Do you want this scone? It came for me but it would probably rather sleep with you!
Chandler, come on nothing even happened!
Look Joe, I know you wanted to do the wedding...
No-hey-no! If you don't want me to do it, I except that. I don't care about that. I just...I don't want you to be upset.
How can I not be upset? Okay? I finally fall in love with this fantastic woman and it turns out that she wanted you first!
Yeah for like a half an hour one night! Chandler, she wants you for the rest of her life! You're so lucky! Look what I missed out on by not being there! Although you know what? It could never have worked like you guys did, 'cause you guys are perfect for each other. Y'know, we look at you and-and we see you together and it just...it-it fits. Y'know? And you just know it's gonna last forever.
That's what you should say.
What?
When you're marrying us; that's what you should say.
Really? I can do it?
I'd love it if you would do it.
Hey!
But those are the words! Those exact words!
Well I don't know remember exactly but, it's-it's pretty much about having and giving and sharing and receiving.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey I'm sorry to do this to you again but uh, is there any way you can look after Ben for a little bit? I-I've got this meeting at school. And-and he-he asked for his uh, 'Fun Aunt' Rachel, so...
Ohhh! Well of course I will watch him! We have fun, don't we Ben?
Okay, I'll see you later pal.
Ohh, okay. Wh-Ah-ha! Wait a minute. Uh Ben, I can't do it.
What?
I can't let him go out that way, he's got a meeting. You've got something here on your back.
What? That's great. That is great. What did we just finish talking about Ben?!
Oh I...
What did we just finish talking about Ben?!
All right, that's it! Come-you-no! You are in big trouble young man!
No! Wait! Come on!
Wait! No! Ben, come here! I am not kidding!
No you guys...
I-I-am-
EHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!! My God!!!!!!!!!!! Oh my God!!!!!!!
Hey!
Hey-hey.
So are guys doing okay?
Yeah, we talked and Monica made me see that I over reacted a little bit and some things in life are more important.
Yeah baby!
I'm really glad you guys are okay but, I just keep thinking what would happen if-if you two actually had hooked up.
Honey! Dinner's ready!
What's my little chef got for me tonight?
Your favorite!
Ho-ho-ho, fried stuff with cheese!
Yep! And lot's of it!
Thanks sweetheart. Give me a little sugar here. Okay.
Okay, in we go.
Here we go! Here we go! Here we go! How you doin'?
Here you go.
Oh my God! This is a six-hour pill! That's it! I'm out of the woods! Ohh! What a relief!
Good for you!
Oh, it's like huge weight has been lifted! 'Cause look, no hair loss, not a rash, no hives, I'm just so happy! Because no shortness of breath, no temporary euphoria-Oh.
So the wedding caterer sent me this list of twelve appetizers and I have to narrow it down to six.
Food? Uh-huh gimme!
So did Monica tell you about this great band called the Swing Kings that we're trying to get to play at the wedding?
Since when are you into swing music?
Oh since forever! I used to go all over town listening to bands!
Chandler.
Gap commercial. So did you book them? Did you call?
I will.
Do you want me to call?
No, I'll do it. You just stick to your job.
What is your job?
Staying out of the way.
This is impossible Monica, why don't you just pick all 15?
There were only twelve.
Oh yeah, I added three.
What are peanut butter fingers?!
Oh yeah...
Well hello! She's cute! Should we uh, go try to talk to her?
Sure! That's one of the great things about being engaged. I'm not nervous talking to pretty girls anymore.
Could you guys help me?
Uh yeah! Let me, let me get that for you.
It-it's really heavy.
I got it. So hi, I'm uh, I'm Ross and this is my friend Chandler.
I-I am Kristen.
Kristen, hi. Are you uh, new to the area, 'cause if you are...I'd love to show you around sometime.
I...I uh, actually just moved from four blocks over.
Ah.
But-but this block is like a whole other world.
Y'know actually it does have a very interesting history. Uh, this street is the first street in the city to have an underground sewer system. Before that sewage and waste would just flow right down the street. Yeah, sometimes ankle deep!
Smooth.
Excuse me?
Umm, say you're gonna be starving after all this moving. What do you say I take you to dinner tonight?
Oh I'd like that.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Great! Uh, let me take this up for you.
After you.
Oh no-no, after you. Oh my God!
Am I crazy or does this totally go?!
Oh my God! You look so beautiful!
Thank you Rachel but, look at Monica!
This is it. Yeah, this is the one. I can't believe I found it!
Wow you look so beautiful! If I knew you, I'd cry.
Well I'm Monica Geller, ball like a baby.
I'm Megan Bailey.
Have you found your dress yet?
Oh no, these dresses are all so amazing but there is no way I could afford one.
No, I can't afford this either. No. I-I-I'm, I'm just to figure out which one I want then I'm gonna get it at Kleinman's, this discount place in Brooklyn, day after tomorrow they are having a huge sale.
Oh, thanks for the tip.
Yeah! So-so when are you getting married?
Oh I'm not, I just like to try these on.
I do the same thing.
I'm just kidding. I'm getting married July 25th.
I'm just kidding too. I'm getting married in December.
So when are you getting married?
Oh May 15th.
Oooh it's getting close!
Yeah!
So uh, who's your photographer?
Jeffery.
We met with him. Did he show you the photos of the nude wedding he did?
The best man? Wow!
I know! I almost called off my wedding. Oh, who's your band?!
Oh, my fiancee wants the Swing Kings.
Oh, you're so lucky. My fiancee wants the heavy metal band Carcass.
Ooh, is that spelled with a 'C' or a 'K'? Oh my God! It doesn't matter; they're both great!
Oh y'know what? Y'know what? Now that you know what you want you should go to Kleinman's and get it half off. This place is so overpriced.
I own this store.
So, does this come in another color or...
Hi! You uh, movin' in or movin' out?
I'm moving in.
Oh uh, can I give you a hand?
Oh okay. But y'know what? Be careful. Because a guy was helping me before had to leave because he hurt his back.
Boyfriend?
No.
I'm Joey.
Kristen.
Oh wow, what a beautiful name! What is it again?
Kristen.
Got it! So...
So uh, do you live around here?
Yeah! Yeah! Right down there. Hey listen; let me give you a little tip. Do not take a nap on this stoop or you can wake up with your shoes gone.
I'll remember that.
Okay. Yeah. Listen would you uh, would you like to have dinner with me tonight?
Oh I, I have plans tonight.
Oh.
But how about tomorrow?
Sounds great! Okay all right, well where does this go?
You look strong, why don't I take that and you grab one of the boxes.
Okay. Yeah. Yeah, I'll grab this one.
What is taking so long?! I mean whatever!
So this is Brooklyn.
All right, listen up. There is usually only one dress in each size so when they open those doors, fan out. Now, this is what you're looking for! Memorize it! When you locate the dress, blow on these. All right? Three short blasts, when you hear it. Come running.
Okay.
Got it.
All right.
Here he comes! Hurry!
Oh they're pushing! They're pushing!!
Hey! Don't be a baby!
Well I...
Let's go!!
Hey! Rachel! Come on!!!!
No. No. Not it. Not it. Not it. Don't crowd me! This is it! This is the dress! Oh my God, it's perfect! I'm sorry, this one's taken! Whoa!
Megan!
Monica!
You came?!
Yeah!
This is my dress!
No!
Yes it is! You saw me wearing it!
And now you'll see me buying it.
What? You freak! You wouldn't even have known about this place if it wasn't for me!
Look, you don't want to fight me.
Maybe I do! I'm pretty feisty!
I'm coming! I'm coming!
Hey!
Okay! Hey! What do I do?!! What are you doing? Did you find the dress?
Did you find the dress?
No! You gotta get me out of here Phoebe! These bargain shoppers are crazy!
I-We gotta get Monica.
No! You gotta hold my hand!!
Oh my God!! Excuse me! Excuse me!
Go! Go! Go!
Hey...
NOW!!!!!!!!
So Ross, how was your date the other night? Did you tell her about the magical ride that starts with the flush of every toilet?
Laugh all you want but uh, she actually left me a message saying she'd like to go out again.
Huh.
Yeah in fact, I'm gonna go call her right now. And I'll make sure to tell her my friend Chandler says...
Hey Chandler!
Hey!
Listen, sorry I didn't stop by last night but I had a date.
Uh Joe, when it's one o'clock in the morning and you don't come by? That's okay!
Well check it out, I was with this really hot girl who just moved in right across the street!
Really? Right across the street?
Yeah!
When'd you meet her?
Two days ago.
Excellent! Y'know Ross met somebody too!
Oh yeah?
Hey.
Hi! How'd it go?
Oh great! We're going out again Saturday. But I just found she's also seeing some other guy.
Really?! Joe? What would you do if you were in Ross's situation?
Well, I sorta am. I mean yeah, I'm dating this girl who's also seeing another guy. But, I don't know, I'm not to worried about it.
Well you shouldn't be. Believe me I wouldn't want to be the guy who's up against you. I mean that doofus is going to lose!
So this is nice! I wish I didn't have to go, believe me! But unfortunately I have to. Oh uh, by the way, what's the name the girl you're dating?
Kristen Lang.
Bye!
Well obviously only one of us can keep dating her.
Obviously! So, how do we decide?
Well now let's-let's look at this objectively, I think I should date her...
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Or, or I'm the one who dates her.
That's interesting, but check this out. I date her...
Yeah-yeah I like that but just to go in another direction...
Okay, okay. This can go on for a while.
Yeah well we should order some food then.
No Joey! Look why don't, why don't we just let her decide? Okay? Hey-hey, we'll each go out with her one more time. And-and we'll see who she likes best.
That sounds fair.
Maybe I'll take her to that new French restaurant down the street...
Ah yeah-wait a second now! Look we're gonna have to set a spending limit on the date. I don't have the money to take her to a fancy place like that.
Well sorry, that's what I do on dates.
All right, well I guess I'll just have to do what I do on dates.
So let's decide on the spending limit...
Yeah. Uh, ...a slice......six dollars?
I was thinking more like a hundred.
Okay. Can I borrow 94 dollars?
Oh...
I know. Hand me a tissue.
You're out of Diet Coke.
Hello? What?! You what?! Hey you listen here missy! Wh-
What?!
That was that girl Megan! She booked the Swing Kings on the day of our wedding and said that I couldn't have them back unless I gave her the dress!
Does that mean Carcass is available?
What am I gonna do?! That is the dress! That is the dress! Wh...Chandler wants the band. What do I do?
Well just figure out a way to talk him out of it.
How?
You're out of toilet paper!
Hey!
Hey! What's up?
I just wanted to come by and y'know, wish you good luck on your date.
Oh thanks!
Yeah. What time are you meeting her?
We have 8:00 reservations at Grammercy Bistero.
Wow, that's in like 20 minutes. You'd better get dressed.
I am dressed.
Oh. Well good! For me. What is this? Did you give yourself a facial?
I have an oily T-zone!
Okay dude! Hey you uh, you sent Kristen flowers.
That's right.
You spent a hundred dollars. That's the limit. You're screwed!
Uh actually, I sent the flowers before the actual date. So techincally, technically I didn't break any rules. Thanks for stopping by though.
Oh-oh! So that's the way it's gonna be huh? Yeah I can break the rules too y'know!
Oh yeah? What are you gonna do?
I don't know.
Why am I not surprised?
Y'know what Ross? I'm not gonna let you get away with this!
I don't think you have much choice.
Well we'll see!
Bye-bye!
Yeah bye-bye! Hey! So just a light layer?
Yes. Yes. Just here and there .
Joey got meat sauce on the banister again!
Yeah, swing music is so out.
Phoebe, he's gotta be in the room for that to work.
What are you guys talking about?
Well umm, we were just talking about the y'know, the Swing Kings and just wondering whether y'know, they were the right way to go.
Yeah, I went to a wedding once where they had swing music and uh, two months later the couple got divorced. And now I'm not saying that there's any connection here y'know, but they did tell me that's why they got divorced.
But I love swing music!
Yeah but the Swing Kings? Y'know they suck so much that people actually die at their concerts-They just stop living.
Look all I know is when Monica and I went to see them, we had fun! And there's another reason too.
Well, what is the other reason?
I don't want to say.
Well you have to because maybe it's stupid.
Well it's just while Monica and I were dancing to them it was...the first time I knew that...you were the woman I wanted to dance all my dances with.
Oh crap!
So they said our table will be ready in just a few minutes.
Oh great!
Yeah.
Is your back feeling better?
Oh yeah it's fine. I guess the more muscles you have the more they can spasim out of control.
Kristen?
Joey!
Hi!
Hi! What are you doing here?
Oh I like this place. And technically, technically I'm not breaking any rules so I...
Well uh, Ross? This is Joey. Joey? Ross.
Hi!
Hi. It's nice to meet you. I used to have a friend named Joey. I don't anymore.
Our table will be ready in a couple minutes.
Yeah. So...
Sure! I would love to wait with you guys! Thanks!
So Joey umm, you look familiar. Are uh, are you on TV or something?
Well Joey doesn't like to talk about it but, he's one of the stars of Days Of Our Lives.
That's right! That's right, don't you play a woman?
A woman in a man's body.
Much better.
So y'know Ross it's funny 'cause, you look familiar to me too. Have you ever been married?
Well yes, yes I have. In fact umm, just the other day Kristen and I were talking about how I've been married and how I have a son.
Yeah, little Eric.
That's right! Wait no, Ben.
So you've just married the one time then?
Well umm...
You've been married twice?
Yes. And another time after that. Boy I'm getting hungry! Hey Joey, have you ever been so hungry on a date that when a girl goes to the bathroom you eat some of her food?
You said the waiter ate my crab cake.
Yeah. So uh Ross, well now-why did that first marriage breakup? Was it because the woman was straight or she was a lesbian?
Do you two know each other?
No. No.
No. It just seems like Ross is the kind of a guy that would marry a woman on the verge of being a lesbian and then push her over the edge.
Wait a minute! Were you on a poster for gonorrhea?
Have you ever slept in the same bed as a monkey?!
Hey you leave Marcel out of this!
Fine! Have you ever got stuck in a pair of your own leather pants?!
Hey-hey have you ever locked yourself in a TV cabinet VD boy?!
Monkey lover!
When do you think we lost her?
Probably around gonorrhea.
Hi, honey! I'm home!
Don't come in here!
Why? Do you another boyfriend in there or something?
No! We only mess around at his place!
Y'know it's funny I started it but, now it's scary me. So could you come out here please?
No, I'm wearing a wedding dress.
Oh you got a wedding dress? That's great!
Yeah but I'm not keeping it.
Well then why can't I see it?
Oh. I guess you can. Okay but; I-I have to return it, so you can't like it.
Okay I promise. I'll-I'll hate it. Wow! You-you look...hideous.
Really?
Yeah, that's like the most ugliest dress I've ever seen. Wh-why do you to return it?
Oh because it doesn't...really fit. Oh by the way, I-I booked the Swing Kings.
Oh that's great! Great! Thanks! But that dress I mean it's like yuck! It's terrible! It makes me wanna just rip it right off of you!
Okay! But you can't rip it. Well, maybe a little.
Okay!
Hey guys! Do you wanna look at the song list for the wedding? Guys?
I thought you were gonna be gone all day.
All right? What's going on?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I-I should probably leave you girls alone.
Yeah, laugh all you want but in ten minutes we're gonna have younger looking skin!
Yeah! Y'know, she could use a little... Oh nice shot!!!
Hey! You guys! You're not gonna believe this! I just got off the phone with my agent...
Oh my God! I'm sorry, too soon. You go.
Okay. I got nominated for my part on Days of Our Lives!
Joey!
Good for you!
Congratulations! Wow! I can't believe you're nominated for an Emmy!
No-no.
Oh Soap Opera Digest award!
No! I'm up for a Soapie!
Honey? Is that something you're making up?
No, no, no! It's real! And it has been since 1998. Hey Rach! Rach! I'm up for a Soapie!
Oh my God! Oh my God!! That is like the third most prestigious soap opera award there is!
Thank you! Well, I guess now I know who I'm taking to the awards.
Oh, stop that! Don't kid about that! Will all the stars be there?
Many are scheduled to appear.
Oh my God! Oh my God! I can't go! I'm gonna be too nervous!
Okay, I'll go!
No!! You are getting married! This is all I have.
...and it was Ernst Muhlbrat who first hypothesized that the Velociraptor would expand it's collar and emit a high pitched noise to frighten it's predator. Yes Mr. Lewis?
What kinda noise?
Just a high pitched intimidating noise.
But like how?
Well we-we don't know for sure. But in my head it-it sounded something like this. Of course, this is just conjecture. Okay, that's uh, that's all for today. Uh Mr. Morse, can I see you for a moment?
Yes sir.
Mr. Morse I need to talk to you about your mid-term exam, I'm afraid I-I had to fail you.
Why?!
Well you need 60% to pass...
What'd I get?
Seven.
That's not so good.
No-no it's not. What-what happened there Ned?
Well maybe you can cut me some slack. I'm sort of in love.
Well I'm sorry but, that-that's really not my problem.
I'm in love with you.
Well that brings me in the loop a little.
You see, that's why I did so bad on this test. I'm having a hard time concentrating. When you're up there and you're teaching and your face gets all serious...you look so good. You wear that tight little turtleneck sweater...
Okay! Umm, I uh, I'm your teacher. I'm sorry, you're-you're a student and I-and I like women. In spite of what may be written on the backs of some of these chairs.
Oh my God! That guy at the counter is totally checking you out!
Really? My God, he's really cute.
Go for it.
Phoebe, I'm engaged!
I'm just saying, get his number just in case. But no Chandler is in an accident and can't perform sexually and he would want you to take a lover to satisfy the needs that he can no longer fulfill.
Hi!
Op, can I just tell you something? Very flattered but umm, I'm engaged.
Wow! Uh, this is kind of embarrassing. I was actually coming over to talk to your friend.
Well you should be embarrassed.
I thought you knew I was looking at you.
I did, but that was really fun.
And the winner is...Joey Tribbiani! Oh... Wow! I honestly never expected this. I uh, I didn't prepare a speech. But umm, I'd like to thank my parents, who've always been there for me. I'd also like to thank my friends, Chandler, Monica, Phoebe, Rachel...
I'm fourth! Look at you with your little maple syrup award!
Yeah may-maybe you don't tell anyone about this.
What? No! It's not a big deal! I do that too, with my shampoo bottle.
Really?
Yeah.
What award are you practicing for?
Grammy, Best New Artist.
Oh, hey listen! The Soapie's called today and I also get to present an award.
Ohh that's great!
Yeah!
So you'll definitely get onstage, even if you don't win.
What you-you don't think I'm gonna win?
Well of course I do! But y'know, favorite returning character is a tough category Joey. I mean you're up against the guy who survived his own cremation.
Yeah. No-no I-I know I might not win, but it's just...I've never even been nominated before! I want it so much.
Well Joey, you'll probably get it. But you should probably your-your gracious loser face. Y'know when like the cameras are on you and you wanna look disappointed but also that your colleague deserved to win. Y'know? So it's sorta like...
Hey!
Y'know?
You practice losing the Grammies too?
Oh no, at the Grammies I always win.
Ah.
Oh hey!
Hey! How'd your date go with Jake?
Oh, great! We couldn't keep our eyes off each other all night and then every once and a while y'know, he'd kinda lean over and stroke my hair and touch my neck.
Okay, stop it Phoebe, you're getting me all tingly.
All I could think of was y'know, "Is he gonna kiss me? Is he gonna kiss me?"
And did he?
I'm a lady Monica, I don't kiss and tell. But this hickey speaks for itself.
Okay-okay, I got it. I got it.
I just like him so much that I just feel like I've had 10 drinks today and I've only had six.
Oh, I haven't had that feeling since I first started going out with Chandler. Wow, I'm never gonna have that feeling again am I?
You sound like a guy.
No, a guy would be saying, "I'm never gonna get to sleep with anyone else." Oh my God! I'm never gonna get to sleep with anyone else! I've been so busy planning the wedding that I forgot about all the things that I'd be giving up! I mean, I...I'm never gonna have a first kiss again.
You'll have a last kiss.
Can I ask you something? Have you ever had a guy have a crush on you?
Is that why you wanted to tie my tie?
There's this kid in my class who said he's in love with me.
Whoa!
Whoa what?
Ross has a boyfriend.
I do-I do not have a boyfriend. There's a guy in one of my classes who-who has a crush on me.
Really?
Yeah! I don't know. I mean, last year Elizabeth now-now this kid. What-what-what-what is it?! Am I giving out some kind of...sexy professor vibe?
Not right now.
It-it-The point is my natural charisma has made him fail his midterm.
Oh, see now I feel bad for the kid! I had a crush on a teacher once and it was so hard! Y'know you-I couldn't concentrate and I blushed every time he looked at me. I mean come on, you remember what's it's like to be 19 and in love.
Yeah. I guess I can cut him some slack.
Yeah.
How'd you get over that teacher?
I didn't. I got under him.
Problem solved.
Bye Phoebe.
Okay bye.
All right. Bye.
Bye! We said good-bye at the door so as not to flaunt our new love.
Phoebe, it's okay. You don't have to tip toe around me. I-I've been thinking about it and umm, y'know what? I'm okay about not having that new relationship feeling...
I miss you already!!
I miss you too!!!!
See? That's what I mean. I mean that, that's great! But I wouldn't trade in what I have for that. I mean I'm gonna be with Chandler for the rest of my life, and that's what makes me happy. Hey sweetie, come here! Come sit down. Hey Phoebe and I were just talking about how our relationship is deep and meaningful. It really is don't you think?
Oh totally! Pull my finger.
Presenting the award for Favorite Returning Male Character is McKensize...
This is it! This is my category.
I know! My God! Do you have your speech?
Yeah, I got my speech!
Do you got your gracious loser face?
Yeah.
Now Joey remember, if you win you have to hug me! You hug me!
Okay. Can I squeeze your ass?
On TV?! Yeah!
'Kay!
In The Category Of Favorite Returning Male Character The Nominees Are John Wheeler from General Hospital , Gavin Grant from The Young and the Restless , Dunkin Harrington from Passions , and Joey Tribbiani from Days of Our Lives . And the Soapie goes to......Gavin Grant from The Young and the Restless!
What the?!
Presenting the award for Favorite Supporting Actress is Joey Tribbiani from Days of Our Lives.
Any one of the brilliant actresses nominated for this award tonight deserves to take it home. Unfortunately only one can. The nominees for Best Supporting Actress are from Passions Erin Goff. From One Life to Live Mary Loren Bishop , from All My Children Sarah Mchann, and from Days of Our Lives Jessica Ashley. And the winner is......Jessica Ashley from Days of Our Lives. Uh, unfortunately Jessica couldn't be with us tonight so I'll be accepting this award on her behalf. And I'm sure that Jessica would like to thank my parents who always believed in me. She'd also like to thank my friends, Chandler, Monica, Ross, Phoebe, and Rachel who's sittin' right there!
Joey! Why did we have to rush out of there so fast?!
Rach we had to get out of there because, look what I won!
Oh my God you stole her award!
No-no! No, I'm accepting it on her behalf.
Joey I don't think you know what behalf means.
Sure I do! It's a verb! As in, "I behalfin' it!"
Joey, you have got to take this back!
But why?! I should've won one and I really want it and she didn't even care enough to come to the thing! It could also be a Grammy.
No! Joey!
Come on Rach! No one saw me take it! There was a whole table full of 'em.
Do you really want an award you didn't win?
No! I want an award I did win! But nobody's giving me any of those! Plus-Hey Rach, if-if I put it up there right? When people come over they'll see it and they'll think I won it.
Joey is says Best Supporting Actress!
I can scratch that right off.
Joey no, this is wrong! You have to take it back, okay? You don't want to win an award this way. You're very talented. And someday you're gonna win one of these for real and that one is gonna mean something.
All right!
All right? Thank you.
I'll take it back tomorrow.
Thank you.
If I can't have it you can't have it!
Professor Geller?
Yes Mr. Lewis, how can I help you?
I know I didn't do well on my midterms and stuff but, I was kinda hoping you could change my grade.
And why exactly would I do that?
Because I'm in love with you.
What?!
Yeah, I'm all...in love with you and stuff. So could you change my grade?
No!
Well why not you changed Ned's grade!
Well that's different! Okay? Because he, he was actually in love with me!
No he's not! He's totally yanking your chain! He's done this with three other teachers!
What?
He's got a girlfriend!
I can't believe someone would do that for a grade.
I know! It's awful. I love you.
Have you seen Chandler?
No. Why?
'Cause I just keeping thinking about all these things that I'm not gonna have and it's freaking me out. I don't know what to do about it.
Okay, don't sweat it. Chandler is nowhere around so go ahead get it out of your system. That guy's cute.
Phoebe! Come on I'm serious! I just got to talk to him about all this.
No that is the last thing you want to do!
Why?
Because you're marrying him!
You gotta help me out here Pheebs.
All right, I've never been engaged and I've never really been married, but I can only tell you what my mother told me. Whenever you have doubts or fears or anxieties about a relationship, do not communicate them to your husband.
So I'm not supposed to share my doubts and fears with the guy I'm gonna spend the rest of my life with?
That is correct! Yes, you're supposed to take all of that stuff and put it in a little box in your mind and then lock it up tight.
Your mother told you this?
Yes!
The woman that got married a bunch of times and killed herself when you were 13?
Oh my God! You're right! Go! Go tell Chandler! Hurry before it's too late! Wait no! Does this also mean putting out doesn't get you love?
I cannot believe I'm gonna meet Jessica Ashley!
Okay wait-wait p-please be cool! Okay? I work with this woman.
Okay, I'm totally cool!
Come in.
Hey Jessica.
Hey Jess.
Ah, this is my friend Rachel.
Hi.
'Sup?
Uh listen, here's your Soapie. I accepted it for ya.
Oh my God! I won! Do you have any idea what this means?!
Well, that-that-that's it? You're gonna, you're gonna put it on your self or anything?
No, I try to save that for real awards. Now, if you'll excuse me.
Take it back?
Absolutely.
Y-y-yeah! Yeah you do.
Honey, as we get closer to the wedding, is there anything that you would like to talk about or share?
Okay. Well, I think the centerpieces are too big
You're wrong! The centerpieces are fine! Do you ever get scared at all?
Kinda. They're really big.
Doesn't it ever just freak you out that-that you're never gonna be with anybody new again?
What?
Just, I love you so much. Just...It's just sometimes it bothers me that I'm never gonna have that feeling. Y'know when you meet someone for the first time and it's new and exciting? Y'know that rush?
No. No, see when I first meet somebody it's uh it's mostly panic, anxiety, and a great deal of sweating.
Okay, but all right you're a guy, does it not freak you that you're never gonna sleep with anybody else?
Sleeping with somebody new, anxiety, panic, and I'm afraid even more sweating.
Even with me?
I was dangerously dehydrated during the first six months of our relationship. Look, for me the rush is knowing that we are gonna be together for the rest of our lives.
Really?
Well yeah! But now that I know that you're having these thoughts, I'm back to panic, anxiety, and uh I'm definitely gonna need some kind of sports drink.
Come here! Come here! Sweetie you don't have to worry. No, besides y'know what? I'm gonna have a lot of new things with you. The first time we buy a house. Our first kid. Our first grandkid...
Water! Water! Water!
Uh Mr. Morse, can I speak to you for a moment?
That was a great lecture today. Did you get a little hair cut?
Uh-hmm, yeah-yeah do you like it? Do-do you looove it? I just want you to know that I'm changing your grade back.
What?! Why?
'Cause I know what you're trying to pull here. Okay? It's not gonna work.
I'm not trying to pull anything. Look I love you dude.
Y'know what? I-I'm not even gonna talk about this. Okay? This little thing is over. I know you have a girlfriend! Okay--Yeah! And I know about the other professors! How do you think that makes me feel Ned?! You used me! You don't love me and you never did! Ah Professor Winston, Professor Fredrickson, I'll be right with you. Don't make this worse and I'll give you a C. Shall we?
Rach?
I'll be out in a second.
Oh. It's just so unexpected! I...I uh...Boy I'll tell you it's just such an honor to be nominated for a Nobel Prize and y'know to win one for a massage. Especially after having just won a Tony award for best actress in...
Honey, we have to go. Our reservations are at 8:00.
...in Reservations at 8:00 by Neil Simon. Thank-thank you Neil. Thank you for the words.
Okay honey, you can finish this later we're gonna be late. We gotta go.
Please, don't play the music. Just uh one more. LIVE FROM NEW YORK! IT'S SATURDAY NIGHT!!
Oh hey! How was your audition?
I'm sorry, do I know you?
What are you doing?
Nothing, I'm just practicing blowing you off because I'm gonna be a big movie star!
Oh! You got it?!
Well, no not yet. But the audition went really good.
What was it for?
Oh, it's this big budget period movie about these three Italian brothers who come to America around the turn of the century. It's really classy! Oh, and the director is supposed to be the next, next Martin Scorcese.
The next, next?
Yeah, there's this guy from Chicago who's supposed to be the next Martin Scorcese, all right? But then this guy's right after him. Hello!
Joey! It's Estelle! I just talked to the casting people; they loved you!
They loved me!
Yeah, they wanna see you again tomorrow.
Oh my God!
There's just one thing. Do you have a problem with full frontal nudity?
Are you kidding me? I never rent a movie without it! Oh. Uh, okay uh let me call you back.
What's the matter?
They want me to be totally naked in the movie!
Wow!
I know! My grandmother's gonna see this!
Grandma's gonna have to get in line.
Hey the wedding is so close! Are you getting nervous?
Yeah. But a part of me also can't wait 'til it's over. Chandler and I have this pact not to have sex again until the wedding.
A no sex pact huh? I actually have one of those going on with every woman in America.
Hey Phoebe, will you give me a hand?
Sure.
I gotta make up the guest bedroom. Hey, Cousin Cassie is coming to stay with us a few days.
Cassie?
Uh-hmm.
Wow, I haven't seen her for like forever. I wonder if she still carries that Barbie everywhere she goes.
Ross, she's 25 years old.
So what! I still have-No you're probably right.
Hi!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey Pheebs, can I talk to you over here for a second?
Yeah!
Subtle guys!
What?!
I know you're planning my surprise bridal shower.
Well okay-Well don't ruin it! Just play along at least!
Okay. Sorry.
Oh my God! We have to throw her a shower?!
Hey! What did you decide to do about the movie?
I don't know! It's not like it's porn! This is a serious, legitimate movie. Y'know? And the nudity is really important to the story.
That's what you say about porn.
You're right. Maybe I shouldn't even go on the call back.
No! No you should! A lot of major actors do nude scenes! I mean the chance to star in a movie? Come on!
Well that's true. And I am only naked in one scene. Plus it sounds really great. My character's catholic and he falls in love with this Jewish girl. Who run away together and they get caught in this big rainstorm. So we go into this barn and undress each other and hold each other. It's really sweet and-and tender.
Plus, everyone's gonna see your thing.
Well when can we have this shower?
She has got so much going on we-we have only two options. We have Friday...
Well that's only two days away. What is the other option?
Yesterday!
Well if we make it yesterday, woo-hoo! We're done!
Oh my God Phoebe, this is impossible! We can't do this by Friday! We have to find a place. We have to invite people! We have to get food! There's just too much to do! It's impossible! We can't do it! We cannot do it! We cannot do it!
Rachel, calm down!
Okay. I'm sorry. You're right, you're right.
Just calm down woman!
Phoebe, I already, I already did.
Oh okay. All right, then I need to calm down a little.
Okay. Okay. I think we can do this if we just get organized. All right? We have two days to plan this party. We just need to make fast decisions! Okay? All right, where are we gonna have it?
Uh, here. What time?
4 o'clock. Food?
Finger sandwiches and tea.
Ooh great! Very Monica.
And chili!
Ah you went one too far. Uh, flowers or balloons?
Both!
We're paying for this y'know.
Neither.
Okay. Umm, what should we do for the theme?
Lusts of the flesh.
What?
I don't know. A cowboy theme?
Hey!
Hey!
Y'know I'm-I'm really glad we decided not to sleep together before the wedding.
Oh boy me too!
Y'know I was thinking if we had a...a big fight and uh we broke up for a few hours...
Yeah?
Technically we could have sex again. What do you think, bossy and domineering?!
The wedding is off, sloppy and immature!
That's me! Come on!
Okay. But wait, we can't. My Cousin Cassie is in the guest room, we're supposed to have lunch.
Well get rid of her, obsessive and shrill.
Shrill?! The wedding is back on!
I thought I heard voices. You must be Chandler.
Hi! Nice to meet you!
Nice to meet you too.
So, are you ready to go?
Yeah.
Chandler!
I'll be right with you.
Cassie needs to stay at your place.
What-why?
Because Purvry Perverson over here can't stop staring at her.
What?! Chandler she's our cousin!
I was not staring at her. Okay? I was just listening intently. It's called being a good conversationalist. Watch. Say something.
You were staring about eight inches south of there.
Fine, she can stay at my place. By the way, what-what does Cassie even look like now.
She looks exactly like Aunt Marilyn.
Umm, so this Aunt Marilyn is-is-is-is she coming to the wedding?
Wafer thin ice!
Hey, I'm back!
Hi-hi Joey.
Uh so, will-will I be reading the same scene again?
Actually, I tried to call to you. You didn't need to come down here today.
Oh great! Y'know I would've been perfect for this part, but whatever! Y'know, thanks for making a bad decision and ruining your movie! Good day!
Wait Joey! You didn't need to come down because the director saw your tape from yesterday and loved it.
And scene! Huh? Wasn't that fun? We did a little improv there. Yeah! Okay! So you-you-you-you were saying?
Well, the director thinks you're really right for the part and wants to meet you tomorrow.
Wow! Sure! That's great!
Oh and your agent said you were okay with the nudity.
Yeah! Yeah sure, just long as it's handled tastefully and that barn is not too cold.
Terrific! Well uh, there's one more thing. Uhh, uh it's really important to the director that everything in this movie is authentic. Yeah and so in your love scene with Sarah she talks about how she's never seen a naked man who wasn't Jewish. So...
So...What?
So uh well the director is insisting that whoever play that part be authentically, anatomically not Jewish. Do you know what I'm saying?
Yes!
Okay.
No. What?
An Italian Catholic immigrant at this time would not be...
Barmifsaed?
So to get this part you can't be?
Nope.
But you are?
Yep.
But you told them you weren't?
That's right.
Wow! Wow! And it's definitely all gone? There's nothing there to work with? What were you thinking?
I don't know! I really want this part! And they tell you no matter what you get asked at an audition you say yes. Like if-if they want you to ride a horse, you tell 'em you can! And just figure out how to do it later.
Joey! This is not like learning to ride a horse! This is like learning to...grow a turtleneck!
I kn-I know! I know! Okay? And apparently tomorrow when I go in to meet the director I have to take off my clothes so that they can see what my body looks like.
Oh my God, what are you gonna do?!
I just have to call my agent and tell her I can't do the part.
Unless!
Unless what?
Well, this may sound crazy, but there maybe something we could fashion.
Like what?
Well I'm not sure yet, but umm of the top of my head I'm thinking double sided tape and some sort of luncheon meat.
Hey! I've got a great idea for party favors for the shower. Okay, we get some uh mahogany boxes and carve everyone's names in them and inside is everyone's individual birth stone.
Okay. Okay. All right, you take care of that. And meanwhile, the party is tomorrow and we still don't have a guest list.
Okay. Okay! Well okay, who do we know that's coming? Me. Are you?
Hey!
Hey!
Hey! What's up Mon?
Well uh, I'm trying to make something for Joey. Do you mind if I raid your fridge?
Have at it.
Okay. All right, turkey. Eh, that won't work. Cheese? That won't work. Olive loaf? I hope that won't work.
Are you makin' him a sandwich?
No it's umm, more like a wrap. Okay so uh, I'm gonna go guys.
Okay.
I guess you can get back to deciding on what to get me for a present!
We have to get her a present?!
Okay but look! Look at what I got! It's her address book! We have a guest list!
Oh my God you're amazing! Did you just pull that out of her purse?
Uh-huh, and a little seed money for the party.
Cassie?!
Hey Ross!
Hey!
It's been so long! Last time I saw you, you were setting up your tent in line to see Return of the Jedi.
Oh. Oh, that's right. So-so you did see me that day because it seemed like you didn't.
Ah yeah, sorry about that.
It's okay. Come, come on in.
Thanks for letting me stay here! I mean Monica's place was nice, but her fiancee sure stares a lot.
Oh.
Oh my God! You do a great Chandler!
Uh-huh. Yeah I-I have a knack for impressions.
Well, maybe after we get reacquainted uh, you can do me.
Yeah-No!!
Cassie, how you-how you doin' on that...hot dog.
I'm all done.
Thank God.
I guess the last time we really hung out was when our parents rented that beach house together.
Oh right. Right. Ooh, remember the time I uh, I pinned you down and tickled you 'til you cried? We're probably too old to do that now.
I'll always remember that summer, because it's when I got all of these freckles.
Uh-huh! Uh-huh! And-and-and I'll always remember that summer because that's when I realized that we are related.
It took you that long to figure it out, huh?
Well I'm, I'm a little slow. Just as our children would be.
Hi!
Hi!
How are you? Good. Hi, thanks for coming.
Oh thank you.
Thank you. No? All right. Oh, it's so nice to see you.
No.
No thanks.
Okay. Hey Rach?
Yeah?
Who the hell are all these people?
Well, I don't know. I called all the people in Monica's phone book and these are the only ones who could show up on 24 hours notice.
Hmm, y'know there's another word for people like that. Losers!
Hi! I'm Rachel. This is Phoebe. I'm the maid of honor. How do you know Monica?
I was her accountant four years ago.
Ohhhh!
I'm very interested to find out who's been doing her taxes these last four years.
That's great!
So, what time is Monica supposed to get here?
I don't know.
Excuse us for a minute. You didn't tell her to come?!
You were supposed to tell her!
No I wasn't! You were supposed to tell her to come and I was supposed to bring the cake!
Fine, I'll go call her.
Yes! And please tell her to bring a cake!
Okay, we have a lot of options here, a number of prototypes for you to try on.
Wow! This looks great!
Yeah! Okay, this one is a mushroom cap. Umm, this one is made of bologna.
And-and-and-and-and the toothpicks?
Oh, just until the glue dries.
Thank God!
Now, these are-are more realistic, but perishable.
Ah.
Okay? Over here we have pink suede, which is nice. But umm, if it gets wet then you know it's gonna shrink.
Well maybe we just take that one away.
I also, did a little something in fur. But umm, that's really just for me. Okay. So, why don't you go into your room and try these on and we'll see-get a better idea of what's gonna work.
Thanks, you are such a good friend. And this is so weird.
Ow!
Toothpick?
Yeah.
What are you trying on now?
The fruit roll up.
And?
Delicious.
Joey!
Wait a minute! Wait a minute! We have a winner!
What?! Which one?!
The Silly Putty! It's not so silly anymore!
She's your cousin. She's your cousin! If she knew what was going on in your head she'd think you were sick! Or would she? Let's back up a second. She was the one who suggested opening a bottle of wine. She was the one who turned down the lights. She was the one that wanted to rent Logan's Run, the sexiest movie ever. Oh, I know that look. Forget it. I want it. She wants it. I'm going in.
Hey! What the hell are you doing?!
Say something clever! Okay, doesn't have to be clever, it just has to be words. Say some words. Any words will do. Oh my God! This is the longest that anyone has not talked ever! There is nothing you can say to make this worse!! So just say something!! I-I, I uh haven't had sex in a very long time. Yeah, you really shouldn't have said anything.
Phoebe! Rachel! It's Monica! I wonder what you could possibly need me for on such short notice! Oh.
Oh Monica, we are so sorry.
For what?
Well first, for forgetting to throw you a bridal shower.
And then for forgetting to invite you to it.
You al-you already had it?
Yeah. Well, we called everyone in your phone book and bunch of people came, but it took us so long to get you here that they-they had to leave.
Yeah, we wanted to throw you a big surprise and a great shower, and now you don't have either.
We ruined everything.
Ugh...
Well no wait a minute that's not true! No, what did, that was really sweet. And it kinda works out for the best.
What do you, what do you mean?
Well now, I get to spend my shower with the only people I really love! I mean, I get all those presents without having to talk to people I don't even like!
Surprise...
Sur-surprise.
...Monica.
And what's cool is, the character is from Naples, right?
Yeah.
My whole family's from Naples!
Oh that's great! Okay, well I've heard everything I need to hear. I just need to uh, Leslie...
Joey, this is awkward part.
Oh! Hey right! Not a problem. I totally understand. You need to y'know make sure I don't have any horrible scars or tattoos. Don't you worry; I have nothing to hide. So there you go, that's me. One hundred percent natural! I tell ya, that has never happened before.
Cassie, are you finding everything okay in there?
Yeah! Thank you so much for letting me stay here.
Oh! No problem! I...
What?
Say something! Say anything! Ask her out! She's not your cousin!
Hey! Out of all of us, who do you think is gonna get married next?
Probably Monica and Chandler.
Hi. Could I have a pack of Newport Lights, please?
Oh umm, uh we don't sell cigarettes, but they have them at the newsstand across the street.
That'd be great, thanks.
Oh my God, Melissa Warburton. I don't think I have the energy for this.
Oh my God! Ray-ray Green?!
Melissa!
You have been M.I.A for the past seven sorority newsletters, what's up with you?!
Wh--Why don't I tell you over here?
So last I heard you were gonna get married. Oh poor Ray-ray.
Oh no-no, no! It's good! It's all good! I-I actually work at Ralph Lauren!
Shut up!
I will not! I'm the divisional head of men's sportswear!
Oh shut up more! Now, are you friends with Ralph?
Oh please...
Are you?!
No.
Listen, we-we have to have dinner. What-what are you doing tomorrow night?
Oh tomorrow, oh I don't know. Um...
You do now. You're having dinner with me.
Shut up.
I-I've got to go. This has been so great Ray-ray! Oh, there you are. Umm, so listen, just call me. Here's my card.
Oh, wow thanks! Oh you're in real estate!
Oh no, that's-that's an old card. Umm, I wanted to get out of that and-and do something where I can really help people and-and make a difference.
Wow! What do you do now?
I'm a party planner. I'll see you tomorrow.
Okay!
Hey guys! Look who's back! It's Ray-ray!
Shut up that was my friend Melissa from college.
She seems really, really fun!
She's actually very sweet and we used to be very close.
Wait a minute, she isn't... She's not the one who you...
Who you what? Who you what?!
Yes.
Wow!
Wow? Wow what?! Wow what?! Who you-what?!!
It's not a big deal!
They were lovers.
What?!
What?!
No we weren't! It was nothing! It was one night, senior year we went to a party, had a lot of sangria and y'know, ended up...kissing for a bit.
So that's two of my wives.
Okay so this is where the band is. And this is where the bar is. And all these pins have people's names on them. And Rach, here you are.
Oh wow. Why don't we just take me and put me with a Manhattan in my hand, talking to the cute bartender. These pins aren't for playing are they?
Okay, the red ones are my guests and the blue ones are yours.
This is so sad. I mean, I only have like ten pins.
Chandler, relax it's not a contest. Certainly not a close one.
Hello!
Hey!
Hey Rach.
Stop picturing it!!
Okay, I think that's it. The seating chart is done. This is our wedding. They all look like they're having fun don't they?
Hey, so where are my parents gonna be?
Oh! Let's see, well...if this is the wedding hall then umm you're parents will be at home in Queens.
What they're not invited?! Oh no, that's terrible! They're gonna be crushed!
Why would they think they're invited?
You got me. I don't...
Joey!
Well, I'm sorry. I thought parents were coming! Y'know? Your parents are comin'! Chandler's parents are comin'! Ross's parents are comin'!
Ross's parents are my parents!
Well-well-see? Parents are comin'!
Y'know I think we should invite them.
Oh please, you just want more blue pins.
Well this is just sad!
All right, all right. Maybe I can fit them in if I just do some rearranging. But uh, Rachel may actually have to sit at the bar!
That is not a problem.
Maybe you'll order a little sangria?
Oh, get out of here!
So now, these are all the tuxedos that we make and if there's anything that you like, we can make you a deal. Anything at all. But these are the three that Monica pre-approved.
Well, thanks a lot for hookin' me up Rach. I want you to know that I want you to attend our wedding as my guest.
I'm Monica's maid of honor. Okay? Don't try to blue pin me!
Well, what's the deal with these? These-these look nice.
Oh they are nice. We-we custom-make tuxedos for celebrities and then when they're done with them they just send 'em back.
You mean like for award shows?
Some of them.
You mean these tuxes have been down the red carpet with people yelling, "You are you wearing?! You look fabulous!"
Honey, might I suggest watching a little more ESPN and a little less E!?
Okay, who wore those?
Umm, well let's see uh, this one is Tom Brokaw.
Not bad.
This one is uh Paul O'Neil.
Who's that?
He plays for the Yankees. Seriously, ESPN! Just once and a while, have it on in the background. Ooh, this one was Pierce Brosnan!
Pierce Brosnan?
Uh-huh.
Are you serious?
Yeah.
007?! This is James Bond's tux?!
Yeah.
Oh, I have to get married in James Bond's tux!
It's a pretty cool tux.
Oh, it's not just that, I would be England's most powerful weapon. Jet setting heartbreaker on her majesty's secret service. A man who fears no one; with a license to kill. Would Monica let me wear this?
We should really learn how to play the real way.
I like our way. Oh! Chess!
Nice move.
Yeah.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
So Joey I just hooked Ross and Chandler up with some tuxedos for the wedding, do you need one?
No, I'm performing the ceremony. I'm not wearing a tux.
Well, what are you going to wear?
Multi-colored robes! Ooh, and maybe a hat.
Huh. Does Monica know about this?
I don't think so.
Can I please be there when you tell her?
Hey oh, Rach wait! Do you want to go to a movie tonight?
Oh, y'know what? I can't. I have to have dinner with that Melissa girl.
Can I come?! I won't even talk! You'll just hear the noise from my video camera.
What is this? What's going on?
Oh good! Can I tell her?! Can I tell her?!
Well, do you want to hear what actually happened or Joey's lewd version?
Joey's!
Okay...
Hey, come on! I had this friend from college and I made the stupid mistake of telling Joey that one time...she and I y'know...kissed a little bit.
Yeah, I'm sure that happened.
It-it did!
Sure!
Hey. It happened!
Yeah, it was senior year in college. It was after the Sigma Chi luau and Melissa and I got very drunk! And we ended up kissing! For several minutes!
Which means she had a couple spritzers and a quick peck on the cheek.
Why are you taking this away from me?
Yeah, why is it so hard for you to believe?!
Okay! I just-I didn't know that you are a lesbian.
I'm not saying that I'm a lesbian! I'm just saying that this happened!
Okay, it just seems pretty wild and you're so-y'know so...vanilla.
Vanilla?!
Yeah.
I'm not vanilla! I've done lots of crazy things! I mean I got-I got drunk and married in Vegas!
To Ross.
All right, y'know what? If you don't want to believe me about this, why don't you just come with me to dinner tonight and she will tell you.
Okay! All right! Yeah! 'Cause I just can't picture it.
Oh-ho, you should get inside my head.
Hey! Guess what I got for your wedding!
A freakish thin date with a hanger for her head?
No. Rachel hooked me up with a tux! But not just any tux, Batman's tux!
What?
That's right! Made expressly for Val Kilmer and worn by him in the hit film...that Batman film he was in.
You can't wear that! I'm wearing the famous tux! James Bond's tux!
So?
So-If you wear that you'll make mine less special.
Well, you need something to make this day special? Hello! You-you-you have the most special thing of all! You are marrying the woman you love.
Please, don't take away my cool thing. Please?! Pretty please?!
Pretty please? Not very uh, 007.
Look, it's my wedding day okay? If you were getting married I would never do anything to upset you.
When I got married you slept with my sister.
That was pretty 007.
Hey.
Hey. Oh good-good you're here! All right, I figured it out. I'm gonna take two tables of eight, I'm gonna add your parents, and I'm gonna turn them into three tables of six. Okay? And I called the caterer; I added two extra meals, we are good to go!
Yeah, they're not coming.
What?!
Somehow they got the idea that you only invited them because of me. They...feel a little unwanted.
Oh that's too bad. It's true, but too bad.
Look Mon, if you could just call my mom...
Oh Joey!
Come on! Look just-just tell-let her know that you really want them to be there. Let's not forget, this is a woman that has sent you many lasagnas over the years.
No she hasn't.
Is it her fault that some of them didn't make it to you?
Well, what am I going to say?
I don't know. Just uh, just tell 'em it was a mix-up with the invitations, or-No-no-no! Blame it on the post office. They hate the post office. And the Irish! But I don't think you can blame it on them so...
Hello? Yeah, hi! Mrs. Tribbiani? Hi, this is Monica Geller. Yeah I'm just calling to say that Chandler and I uh, really hope you can make it to the wedding. Yeah, apparently a bunch of invitations that we sent weren't delivered. Umm, I guess there was some screw up at the damn post office! T-Tell me about it! Yeah, yeah, the US Post Office? No, more like US lost office! What are they Irish?!
...anyway, his name is Allan and we've been going out for three years. He was my first client when I became a party planner. He was planning a party for his girlfriend at the time. Oh well. And he was Theta Beta Pi at Syracuse.
Oh. Oh, that's great!
Hmm Phoebe, were you ever in a sorority?
Of course! Yeah, I was uh, umm Thigh Mega Tampon.
What one?
Yeah! Y'know, we were really huge too, but then they had to shut us down when Regina Philange died of alcohol poisoning.
Oh, isn't a shame when one girl ruins it for the whole bunch?
Anyway, speaking of drinking too much. I was uh, tellin' Phoebe about that one crazy night after the Sigma Chi luau where you and I uh, we made out.
What?
Remember?! We-come on both had the sarongs on, and we had the-the coconut bikini tops...
Yeah?
...we went back the house and we got really silly and we...we made out.
Oh wow, Ray-ray I have no idea what you're talking about.
Really?!
Ross is Batman!
Well, he did manage to keep his identity secret for a long time.
Rachel got Ross the tuxedo that Val Kilmer wore in Batman. Okay Batman is so much cooler than James Bond!
What are you talking about?! 007 has all those gadgets!
Batman has a utility belt!
007 has a fancy car!
Batman has the Batmobile!
007 gets all the ladies.
Batman has Robin! We get ESPN right?
How about you go put on your 007 tuxedo and I'll make you a nice martini.
Actually, I don't like martinis.
How about a Youhoo with a funny straw?
Ooh, yum!
Hey.
Hey.
Listen, I know the invitation says 6:00, but does that mean that you want people to get there at six, or the show is gonna start right at six?
The show?!
Right. Right. The wedding, gotcha. But I mean, it's gonna start a little late right? I mean, weddings start late. Right?
Have you ever been to one of my weddings?
Ah. Yeah. Well look, the thing is it's the same day as my niece's christening and I really want my parents to be there in time to see me. 'Cause my part's just in the beginning I'm not even in the rest of the show-Wedding!
The wedding starts at six.
Okay. Okay, I totally hear ya. Oo how about this? I vamp a little 'til they get there?
You'll vamp?!
Yeah! Yeah y'know, like warm up the crowd. Ask 'em where they're from. 'Cause in Joey Tribbiani you get a minister and you get an entertainer. I'm a minis-tainer! There is no one better! There is no one greater!
How can you not remember us kissing?!
I don't know. I don't remember a lot of things that never happened.
Wh... Come on! Remember? We were on the sleeping porch! We couldn't stop giggling? And our coconuts kept knockin' together?
Oh, somewhere Joey's head is exploding.
Yeah-but come on-Listen, I'm sorry I don't want to make you uncomfortable, but I told Phoebe that it happened and she doesn't believe me.
I'm sorry Ray-ray. I mean if I thought it happened I would say it. Maybe I passed out and you did stuff to me while I was sleeping.
No!!
Rachel, it's okay. You don't have to do this. I believe you. All right? Okay, if-if you say that you kissed Melissa, then you kissed Melissa.
Thank you Phoebe.
She didn't.
I know.
Hey!
You just carry that around?
Yes. I find it to be something of a conversation piece.
Between you and...
Gunther. Hey-hey! Why don't we put them on? Y'know get a picture of Batman and James Bond together.
I would but mine doesn't fit. The pants are a little tight.
A little tight? I could see double-oh and seven in those pants.
Well that stinks. I was looking forward to us wearing our celebrity tuxes together.
Well, does that mean that you're not going to wearing yours?
What are you kidding? It's Batman's tux!!
Let me try it on!
Okay, but just the jacket. Double-oh and seven are not gettin' in there.
Okay. Holy double-vented comfort Batman! What's this?
What?
An invitation for the At First Sight premiere? Oh my God! Val Kilmer didn't wear this in Batman! He wore it to the premiere of some tooty-fruity love story where he played a blind guy!
Let me see that! Oh man!
The only superpower you have is a slightly heightened sense of smell.
Hey! Uh, Monica? Chandler? Can I talk to you guys for a second?
All right that's it, I give up! Whatever you want you can have it! You wanna sing a song? You wanna do a dance? You want your mom stand at the Alter and scream racial slurs? I don't care!
No! No, I-I just wanna thank you guys for what you did for my parents, that was really sweet. They're so happy they get to be a part of your special day.
Oh.
Well, you're welcome. And tell them we're really glad they're coming.
Okay. I will. Ohh! Check out what they got me to wear for the ceremony! Huh? I wear it like this when I marry you guys, and then this is for party time.
It happened! I am telling you it happened!
Okay. Well, it was great meeting you. And uh Rachel, I-I don't think I'll be calling you because umm, y'know you've gotten weird. Take care you guys.
What?! Wait a minute! No wait a minute! Okay? Look, that night was the one wild thing I have ever done in my entire life, and I'm not gonna let you take that away from me! Okay, so if you don't remember that, maybe you will remember this!
My God! You love me!
What?
Of course I remember our kiss. I think about it all the time. I can still hear the coconuts knockin' together I... I just didn't want to tell you 'cause I didn't think that you'd return my love, and now that you have...
Whoa! Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Aww, look who's being suddenly shy. You can't tell me you don't feel what I feel. Nobody can kiss that good and not mean it.
I-I-I-I'm just...I'm just a good kisser!
Shut up!
I'm sorry!
Oh you don't have to be sorry. I'm...I'm obviously kidding. I'm not in love with you. I'm not in love with her. I don't hear coconuts banging together. Yeah, I don't...picture your face when I make love to my boyfriend. Anyway, I gotta go. Eh...kiss good-bye? No? Okay.
Wow! I mean I had no idea that that was gonna...
What the hell was that?!
I just wanted to see what all the fuss was about.
And?
I've had better.
All right! I found one that fits!
Well y'know what they say, the 23rd time's the charm. Aww, look at you all handsome!
Whose is it?
Oh does it matter?! All that matters is that you look so handsome.
Whose is it?
I don't want to say.
Oh, come on! I don't care! Come on! Whose is it?
Diane Keeton.
Do you realize that four weeks from today we're getting married? Four weeks baby!! Four weeks!!!
Do you realize you get louder each week?
There's still so much to do. Have you written your vows yet?
I figured I'd buy those. Pat, I'd like to buy a vow.
Sweetie, you know I have no sense of humor when it comes to the wedding.
Right. So uh, have you written yours yet?
No! But I know exactly what I'm going to say.
Do you happen to know what I'm going to say?
Let's just do it right now. Okay? It won't be hard. Just say what's in your heart.
Look at her go! She must love me more than I love her! What's wrong with me? Ooh, don't open that door.
Monica, there are no words... There are no words! This should not be this hard!
All right, uh... Oh hey, you've done this before Ross, well what did you say when you made up your vows?
Well with Carol, I promised never to love another woman until the day I die. She made no such promise.
I'm so pathetic! Monica knows what she wants to say! You should've seen her. Writing, writing, writing!
Monica what?
What?!
What is the emergency?!
You have to help me! I'm supposed to be writing my vows and all I have is this!
Well, I like the pretty little drawing of you in the wedding dress.
Thank you.
Yeah, except your breasts look kinda small.
Those are my eyes! Those are my breasts.
Oh! Yeah!
Well, why don't you just start with something simple. Like umm, Monica from the moment I met you, I knew I loved you.
Yeah, I'm not sure I can do that.
...everyone, this is Chandler!
Hi, I'm Ross's little sister.
Okay.
Okay. Okay. Okay. Umm, maybe you can start with, "Chandler, even though we were friends; there was a part of me that always knew I wanted more."
All right, there's a nuclear holocaust, I'm the last man on Earth. Would you go out with me?
Ennnh.
Ooh, are we allowed to lie in the vows?!
Well maybe you don't talk about your feelings back then. Maybe you just say something about y'know all the things that he's taught you. Like... Or all the things you taught him.
Now everybody knows the basic erogenous zones. You got one, two three, four , five, six, and seven!
There are seven?! That's one?
It's kind of an important one!
Oh, y'know-y'know what, I was looking at it upside down.
Well, y'know, sometimes that helps.
All right. Umm, you could uh start out with a little 1, a 2, a 1-2-3, 3, 5, a 4, a 3-2, 2, a 2-4-6, 2-4-6, 4, 2, 2, 4-7, 5-7, 6-7, 7 ...7.....7...7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7...!
Oh, I got it! How about saying something like, "Monica...
Monica...
"...when I look back over our time together..."
Yeah?
Well, I can't do everything! Look back over your time together.
Oh, look, twins. Hi, guys. Oh, cute, cute.
No fair. I don't even have one. How come they get two?
You'll get one.
Oh yeah? When?
All right. I'll tell you what. When we're 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and I get together and have one?
Why won't I be married when I'm 40?
Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically.
Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?
No, no, no.
What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me?
Uh, uh.
Well?
Dear God! This parachute is a knapsack!
I'm getting married today!! Ahh, whoo-hoo!!
Do you think he knew I was here?
Nice try.
Wait, wait, wait!
Look, Monica...
Look!
This is not going to work.
I bet this will work!
You are so great! I love you!
What?
Nothing! I said, I said "You're so great" and then I just, I just stopped talking!
You said you loved me! I can't believe this!
No I didn't!
Yes, you did!
No I didn't!
You love me!
No I don't! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
Y'know I was thinking, what if I uh, unpack here?
Then all your stuff would be here.
Well, what if all my stuff was here?
Then you'd be going back and forth all the time, I mean it doesn't make any sense.
Okay. What if we lived together and you understand what I'm saying?
You wanted it to be a surprise.
Oh my God.
Chandler... In all my life... I never thought I would be so lucky. As to...fall in love with my best...my best... There's a reason why girls don't do this!
Okay! Okay! Okay! I'll do it! Oh God, I thought... Wait a minute, I-I can do this. I thought that it mattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thing that matters is that you, you make me happier than I ever thought I could be. And if you'll let me, I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way. Monica, will you marry me?
Yes.
Can we come it yet?! We're dying out here!
Come in! Come in! We're engaged!!!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey, what have you guys been up to?
Oh, we were helping Chandler write his vows, but he kicked us out because Joey kept making inappropriate suggestions.
How is "Monica, I love your sweet ass," inappropriate?
How's Monica coming along with her vows?
Well let's just say its she's lucky she has a sweet ass, 'cause she's not so good at the writing.
I can't believe in four weeks they're gonna be married!
Well let's just hope it works. Y'know nine out of ten marriages end in divorce?
Phoebe that's not true.
Yeah, you're right. How's the Mrs.?
I can't believe they've been together for three years.
Has it been that long?!
Believe me, it seems like less because they hid it from us for so long.
Hey, it's me! I'm comin' in!
I've had a very long, hard day.
Ahh, I'm gonna go get some chicken. Want some?
Ahh, no thanks. No chicken, bye-bye then.
Okay.
Are you okay? I'm so sorry, he wouldn't leave. He kept asking me about chicken.
Chicken? I could eat some chicken.
Hey Joe!
Yeah, can I get a 3-piece, some cole slaw, some beans, and a Coke--Diet Coke.
I don't know why they didn't just tell us.
I know! I mean it's not like we weren't cool about it.
You?! And-and you?!
Yes, but you cannot tell anyone! No one knows!
How?! When?!
It happened in London.
IN LONDON!!!
The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.
But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone!
No-no-no-no-no! You can't!
Please? Please?! We just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay? Just promise you won't tell.
All right! Man, this is unbelievable!
I can't wait to be with you! I'll just tell Rachel I'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours.
Laundry. Huh. Is that my new nickname?
Awww, y'know what your nickname is, Mr. Big...
Arghh!!
Oh, look! There's Monica and Chandler! Hey! Hey, you guys! Hey! Ohh!! Ohh! Ahh-ahhh!!
What?!
Ahhh!! Chandler and Monica!! Chandler and Monica!!
Oh my God!
CHANDLER AND MONICA!!!!
OH MY GOD!!!
OH!! MY EYES!!! MY EYES!!!!
Phoebe!! Phoebe!! It's okay!! It's okay!!
NO! THEY'RE DOING IT!!!
I KNOW!! I KNOW!! I KNOW!
YOU KNOW?!!!
Yes, I know! And Joey knows! But Ross doesn't know so you have to stop screaming!!
What's going on?
Ohhh!!!
HI!! Hi!
What?! What?!
Nothing! Oh God, we're just so excited that you want to get this apartment!
Actually, it looks really good.
Get in here!!!
Okay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that Rachel knows?
Yes, but y'know what? It doesn't matter who knows what. Now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know! Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!
Or, we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own
All right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie.
Bye!
Bye!
Bye Chandler! I miss you already.
Okay, did you see that?! With the inappropriate and the pinching!!
Actually, I did!
Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me?
Ohhh, oh my God! Oh my God! She knows about us!
Phoebe knows about us!
Well I didn't tell them!
Them?! Who's them?
Uhhh, Phoebe and Joey.
Joey!
And Rachel. I would've told you but they made me promise not to tell!
Oh man, they think they are so slick messing with us! But see they don't know that we know that they know! So...
Ahh yes, the messers become the messies!
I'll have to get back to you on that. Okay, bye! Oh my God! He wants me to come over and feel his bicep and more!
Are you kidding?!
No!
I can not believe he would do that to Mon-Whoa! Joey, do they know that we know?
No.
Joey!
They know you know.
Ugh, I knew it! Oh I cannot believe those two!
God, they thought they can mess with us! They're trying to mess with us?! They don't know that we know they know we know! Joey, you can't say anything!
I couldn't even if I wanted too.
Listen, this is totally getting out of hand! Okay? She wants me to put lotion on her!
She's bluffing!
Look, she's not backing down! She went like this!
He's not backing down. He went to get lotion.
Oh man! Aren't you guys done yet?!
Joey look, just look at it this way, the sooner Phoebe breaks Chandler the sooner this is all over and out in the open.
Ooh!
Okay!
I like that! Oh, okay! Show him your bra! He's afraid of bras! Can't work 'em!
Joey! Wow, you didn't rip off any buttons.
It's not my first time.
You go back out there and you seduce her till she cracks!
Okay, give me a second! Did you clean up in here?
Of course.
Oh, you're-you're going?
Umm, not without you, lover. So, this is my bra.
It's very, very nice. Well, come here. I'm very happy were gonna have all the sex.
You should be. I'm very bendy. I'm gonna kiss you now.
Not if I kiss you first.
Ooh.
Well, I guess there's nothing left for us to do but-but kiss.
Here it comes. Our first kiss.
Okay! Okay! Okay! You win! You win!! I can't have sex with ya!
And why not?!
Because I'm in love with Monica!!
You're-you're what?!
Love her! That's right, I...LOVE...HER!!! I love her!! I love you, Monica.
I love you too Chandler.
I just-I thought you guys were doing it, I didn't know you were in love!
So that's it! It's over! Everybody knows!
Well actually, Ross doesn't.
Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet.
No! No! Wh... What are you doing?!! GET OFF MY SISTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Y'know, you're friend's getting married, it's gotta change things.
You really think it would be that different?
How could it not be? I mean pretty soon they're gonna be having kids, and then they're just gonna be hanging out with other couples who have kids. And then maybe they're gonna have to leave the city to be near a Volvo dealership.
Well, things change.
I don't want them to move to a Volvo dealership!
It'll be okay Joe.
I'm sorry, I just...I like things the way they are.
Hey, who's this little naked guy?
That little naked guy would be me.
Aww, look at the little thing.
Yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. Can we be grown-ups now?
Who are those people?
Got me.
Oh, that's Nana, right there in the middle. 'Me and the gang at Java Joe's'.
Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there?
Let's see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25?
Looks like a fun gang.
Ooh, look-look-look-look-look! I got Monica naked!
Nono, that would be me again.
Hey, you guys!
Hey.
Hey.
What's going on?
Well, we were just talkin' about you guys gettin' married and how great it is.
Yeah, you can get a Volvo. If that's what you really want.
Oh that's so sweet.
So we both finished our vows.
Oh!
Hey!
Oh, can we read them?
Yeah, I don't hear Chandler's and he doesn't hear mine.
Okay.
Okay.
Oh, that's beautiful.
Funny one! That's good!
Monica, will-will you marry me?
What? I don't get it.
Oh man, this is hilarious.
Chandler!!
Don't worry honey, we'll make yours funnier.
Okay, what do you guys think?
Dude!
I have never known love like this.
You really like it?
Dude! How-how did you write this?
I stole Monica's and changed the name.
You can't do that!
If he goes first he can!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey uh Mon, I saw the Porsche parked out front, can I get the keys? Thought I'd take that bad boy out for a little spin.
Wait a minute! You let Ross drive the Porsche and when I ask you, you say you're the only one who's allowed to drive it.
Yeah, well he's my brother! And plus he drives so slow he could never hurt it.
It's a car Monica! Not a rocket ship!
Whatever Ross! Just replace the bulbs in the brake lights after you're done.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Saw the Porsche out there Mon, lookin' good. When do I get to take that baby out again?
You let Joey drive it?!
I've never driven it! Okay? Not once! Okay once. Okay, I drive it all the time.
Nice work everybody! So much for the y'know, "You can drive it, but don't tell Rachel" plan!
Wow! I can't believe you lied to me.
Okay, I can fix this! Okay Monica, Rachel thinks all you can talk about is the wedding.
Great! Well Rachel, the reason why I won't let you drive the Porsche is because you're a terrible driver. There! That wasn't about the wedding.
Look Rach if-if you want to go for a ride in the Porsche I'll be glad to take you for a quick spin around the block.
Yeah, you got a couple hours?
Whew! That was a brisk ride!
Take the top down did ya?
Only way to fly.
Come on Ross give me the keys! Monica does not know what she's talking about! I am an excellent driver!
You're fast and irresponsible. That adds up to a bad driver.
Well in High School, that added up to head cheerleader.
Did you see the look that girl just gave me? Huh? She must've seen me cruising in the bad boy.
I think she's checking out your beehive Ross.
What?! Give-give me a brush.
Gimme the keys!
No way!
Well no brush!
Fine! Y'know what? It doesn't matter, because, if I remember correctly, there is a comb on the floor of the bathroom.
Alimony.
Chandler, we still haven't gotten an RSVP from your dad.
Oh! Right. Umm, maybe that's because I didn't send him an invitation.
Chandler! He's your father; he should be at the wedding.
I don't even know the man. Okay? We're not the close. I haven't seen him in years.
Well what are you gonna do when he finds out he wasn't even asked?!
Well he doesn't have to know! It's not like we run in the same circles. I hang out with you guys, and he stars in a drag show in Vegas.
Ooh, I think I wanna trade circles.
Trust me, you don't want him there either. Okay? Nobody is gonna be staring at the bride when the father of the groom is wearing a back-less dress.
So what! As long as he's not wearing a white dress and a veil I don't care.
Okay, I think I need to do some shopping.
Ahhh! Ooh, nice!
My God!
What do you think you're doing?!
Just washing the windshield.
There is no way I am letting you drive this car! So why don't you just hand over the keys?
Oh.
No ah-ah-ah! Do not start this car! Okay! Okay! I will give you twenty bucks if you get out of this car right now!
Look Ross, if you're so freaked out, just get in the car!
With you?! Yeah right!
All right.
Okay! Okay! Okay!
What are you doing?! Get in the front!
In the death seat?!!
Oh my...
Hey guys!
Hey!
Hey sweetie!
Ready to go?
Yeah! Sure! Ooh, I left my purse up at Monica's. I'll be right back.
Wait a minute!
What? Oh. Ooh. Whoa! That one kept going.
So! You and Phoebe huh? How long have you been going out?
Over a month.
Wow! Maybe uh, maybe you and I ought to get to know each other a little better.
Sure, I'd like that.
So uh, what's your name?
Its Jake.
Joey. Hey Jake, do you like the Knicks?
Yeah, big fan.
Me too! There's a game on Tuesday do you wanna go?
Yeah that would be great! Let me make sure I'm not doing anything Tuesday.
Here!
What's this?
It's your suitcase. We're going to Las Vegas.
Are you serious?! I mean like eloping?! No more stupid wedding stuff?! No more these flowers or these flowers or these flowers-Think of the money we'll save!! We're not eloping. I love the flowers. Can our wedding be bigger please?
We're going to Las Vegas to see your dad. It's time you two talked, and I want to get to know my father-in-law.
Y'know we already went over this and I won!
No you didn't. Oh and honey just so you know, now that you're marrying me, you don't get to win anymore.
Look forget it okay? I don't want to go. I don't want to see him. I don't wanna.
Chandler, look I-I know that your dad embarrassed you. I know...
No-no all kids are embarrassed by their parents, you'd have to come up with a whole new word for what I went through. When I was in High School, he used to come to all of my swim meets dressed as a different Hollywood starlet. Y'know it's hard enough to be fourteen. You're skinny. You're wearing speedoes-That your mom promised that you would grow into! And you look up into the stands and there's your dad cheering you on dressed as Carmen Miranda. We was wearing a headdress with real fruit that he will later hand out to your friends as a healthy snack!
Hey, the point is that he was at everyone of your swim meets and he was there cheering you on! Okay? That's a, that's a pretty great dad.
He had sex with Mr. Girabaldi!
Who's Mr. Girabaldi?
Does it matter?!
Chandler, you're not fourteen anymore. Okay? Maybe it's time that you let that stuff go. If your father's not at your wedding...you're gonna regret it for the rest of your life.
Yeah o-okay, but I'm just doing this for you.
Yes!
So I really never get to win anymore?
How much did ever really win before?
Pheebs!
Hey!
Listen, you know how uh, when you're wearing pants and you lean forward I check out your underwear?
Yeah!
Well, when Jake did it I saw that...he was wearing women's underwear!
I know. They were mine.
Oh. No! No wait, that's weird!
No, it's not! We were just goofing around and I dared him to try them on.
That's weird!
I'm wearing his briefs right now.
That's...kinda hot.
I think so too. And that little flap? Great for holding my lipstick.
Yeah, I wouldn't know about that.
And! Y'know what Jake says? That women's underwear is actually more comfortable. And he loves the way the silk feels against his skin.
Yeah well next thing you know, he'll be telling you that your high heels are good for his posture!
There is nothing wrong with Jake! Okay? He is all man! I'm thinking even more than you.
Oh yeah, he looked like a real lumberjack in those pink laceys.
I'm just saying that only a man completely secure with his masculinity could walk around in women's underwear! I don't think you could ever do that.
Hey! I am secure with my masculinity.
Okay whatever.
You've seen my huge stack of porn right?
God. I forgot how much I love driving. I have got to get my license renewed.
You don't have a valid driver's license-Okay that is it! Pull over right now!
Oh Ross you're so tense! You just gotta relax okay? Just need to relax all right? Just need to relax...
What-what are you doing?! Are you-Okay that's not funny! Just stop horsing around!
I am not horsing around okay? I am Porsching around.
Uh-oh.
Okay, stay calm. Nothing is going to happen to you, you are not in that much trouble.
Really? You think so?
I was talking to myself! You're going down!
You're straight. I get it.
I still say that if we had called your dad we coulda gotten better seats.
No! No! I don't want him to know we're yet! I'm not sure I'm ready for that. And besides he's not gonna be too happy to see me either.
Why not?!
I don't know if I've told you this, but he's kinda tried to get in contact with me a lot over the last few years
What?!
Yeah, he's made phone calls, written letters, he even came to New York, but I always said I was too busy to see him. Y'know it's all very Cats in the Cradle-I don't want to get into it. Here we go.
Ladies and gentlemen please welcome the incomparable Helena Handbasket!
Hello darlings.
And there's daddy!
Okay. Switch places with me! Switch places with me! Come on! I'll go under, you go over!
Yeah, I'll get right on that.
Oh come on Ross!!
No Rach! Come on! No-no! Yeah, I'm sure we won't get arrested for this.
Hi officer, was I going a little too fast?
Oh my God.
Can I see your license please?
Oh yes, absolutely! Y'know, it's weird uh, but I had a dream last night where I was stopped by a policeman. And then he uh...well I probably shouldn't tell you the rest.
Your license?
Yes. Here you go Officer uh, Handsome.
That's Hanson.
Oops sorry, my mistake.
Dear Lord!!
Wow!
Here it comes.
This is a great picture.
Really?! You think so? Y'know, I had just rolled out of bed.
Yeah? Well you look phenomenal.
Well she should, it was taken ten years ago!
Y'know you're-you're probably wondering about the old date on there.
Yes I am.
Yeah.
You're an Aquarius, huh?
I bet you're a Gemini.
Nope.
Taurus?
Nope.
Virgo?
Nope.
Sagittarius?
Yep.
I knew it! I knew it, ahh....
Well I tell you what...
Yeah?
You're not gonna speed anymore right?
I won't speed.
And you promise you'll get this taken care of right away?
I promise.
And in the meantime you better let him drive. Does he have a license?
Yeah!
Can he handle the stick?
Oh well...
I can handle the stick!!
I feel pretty. Oh so pretty. I feel pretty and witty and...
Gay!
That can't be your father.
Believe me, I've been saying that for years. Oh my God!
What?
That's Mr. Girabaldi playing the piano.
For I'm loved by a pretty wonderful boy! Hello! And welcome to the show. I see some of our regulars in the audience. And a couple of irregulars.
He's coming into the audience. He's coming into the audience.
Relax! You'll be fine. Oh much better. You're invisible now.
Where are you from?
Bakersfield.
I'm sorry?
Bakersfield!
No-no I heard! I'm just sorry.
It can't happen like this. Okay? I'll meet you back at the hotel.
Oh look, a standing ovation already! So early in the show. Oh turn around honey; let me see your pretty face.
Can we have our drinks please?! Waiter-Uh, tress!
Hey Pheebs!
Hey!
Check it out. How much of a man am I?!
Wow! Nice! Manly and also kind of a slut.
Y'know, I'm beginning to see what Jake was talking about.
Uh-huh.
The silk? Feels really good!
Huh.
Yeah! And-and things aren't as...smashed down as I thought they were gonna be.
That's great Joe!
Yeah! And you have so many more choices than you do with men's underwear!
Uh-huh.
Bikini, French cut, thong! And-and the fabrics! You've got cotton, silk, lace! And y'know what I've always wondered about?
Hmm?
Pantyhose! Y'know? They way they start at your toe and go all the way up to here... I should go take these off shouldn't I?
I think it's important that you do.
So what's your name?
Chandler.
Chandler? What an unusual name! You must've had terribly fascinating parents.
Oh, they're a hoot.
And who is your friend?
I'm-I'm Monica.
Monica! Where are you from?
New York.
I'm not very fond of New York. Queens I like. Ooh, what is this sparkle something! Honey! Huh?
Actually Monica and I are engaged.
Really?! Congratulations. When's the big day?
In...in two weeks.
I see. Well, I wish you both a lifetime of happiness. So you're bald?
Wait! Wait! We'd really love it if you could be there.
We?
I know it would make me happy, ma'am.
Well I wouldn't miss it for the world. Oh! I'm getting all misty here! You'd think I was having my legs waxed or something.
You okay?
Yeah. Thanks for making me do this.
Before we go on with the show, I just want to say to the bride and groom how lucky they are to have found each other. In every life, a little rain must fall. Fortunately, in my life... It's raining men!
Hallelujah!
It's raining men!
Amen!
When I was growing up I...played the one on the far left.
Remind me to introduce you to someone!
Who?
Fourth gear!!
What?! What does he want?! I wasn't doing anything!
Well maybe he saw your hand slip briefly from the ten and two o'clock position.
Maybe it's uh Sergeant Sagittarius coming back to flirt some more!
It's a different guy!
Good evening officer.
Do you know how fast you were traveling back there?
Ah no. I don't, but it could not have been more than sixty.
You're right. It was 37.
I mean you're not gonna give me a-a ticket for driving too slow are ya?
That's right.
Y'know of-officer I uh...I had the weirdest dream last night...
Oh my God!
Your license please.
You don't-you don't want to hear about my dream Officer...Pretty?
It's Petty. I'll be right back with your ticket.
You have a son!
I know. I know.
Feel better?
Yeah! Much! Listen uh, not that I'm y'know insecure about my manhood or anything y'know, but I think I need to hook up with a woman like right now.
Yeah, I understand.
Yeah! Okay! Hey! Hi!
Hi!
Y'know, you look familiar. Do I know you from somewhere?
I don't think so.
Oh! Maybe it's because I'm on television. I'm an actor on Days of Our Lives.
Wow!
Yeah.
Really?!
Hm-mmm.
$4.50 please.
Oh, let me get this. These are for you.
Do you realize this is probably the last time we'll all be here in the coffee house as six single people?
Why?! What's happening to the coffee house?! Oh!
Yep! From now on its gonna be the four of you guys and me and the misses. The little woman. The wife. The old ball and chain.
Old?
The young hot ball and chain.
That's much better.
Op! We gotta go!
Oh, where are you guys going?
We're gonna pick up the wedding dress then we're gonna have lunch with mom.
Ah. Joey you're-you're having lunch with my mom?
No, I-I just heard lunch. But yeah, I can go. Sure!
Y'know what? Actually I'm kinda glad they're leaving 'cause uh, I need to talk to you about something.
What's up?
Well this uh, this may be a little awkward.
Listen, if you want to borrow money, its kind of a bad time. I'm buying dinner for 128 people tomorrow night.
No, its...Its not that. Umm, now what I'm going to say to you, I'm not saying as your friend. Okay? I'm-I'm saying as it as Monica's older brother.
But you're still my friend?
Not for the next few minutes.
During this time...are you, are you still my best man?
Nope.
Do I still call you Ross?
Okay! You guys are getting married tomorrow and-and I couldn't be more thrilled for both of you, but as Monica's older brother I-I have to tell you this. If you ever hurt my little sister, if you ever cause her any unhappiness of any kind, I will hunt you down, and kick your ass! What? I'm-I'm-I'm serious! Come-Hey! Dude! Stop it! Okay? I'm-I'm not kidding here!
Hey, I hear what your saying, okay? And, thanks for the warning.
No problem.
So are we...friends again?
Yeah.
Okay. You won't believe what Monica's older brother just said to me!
What 'cha doing Mon?
I'm making a list of all the things that are most likely to go wrong at the wedding. Now, that way I can be prepared.
What are they?
Well, so far I have uh, my bride's maids dresses won't get picked up, my veil gets lost, or I don't have my something blue.
Hey! Those are all the things I'm responsible for!
I had to go with the odds Rach.
Hey! You guys! Remember that audition I had a while ago and didn't get the part?
The commercial?
No!
That play?
No!
That other play?
Nooo!
The movie?
Yes!!
Ohh!
Yes that's the one about the soldiers who fight in World War I!
Oh, yeah! Back then y'know, we called the Great War. It really was!
Well anyway, the guy they wanted backed out and now they want me! I start shooting today!
Congratulations!
Oh that's great!
Wait! Wait! Wait! You can't start today! Today's the rehearsal dinner!
Oh no, I'll be done by then.
Oh. Well then way to go you big movie star!
I know! All right, I'll see you guys over there! I'm off to fight the Nazis.
Oh, wait Joey! We fought the Nazis in World War II, not World War I.
Whoa! Okay. Yeah well, who-who was in World War I?
Go ahead.
You're gonna be late! Go! Go!
Who did we fight in World War I?
Mexico?
Yes! Very good.
Hey Joey! We're ready.
Yeah! Me too.
Richard? We're ready for you. Joey Tribbiani? This is Richard Crosby he's playing Vincent.
I'm doing my scenes with you?
Nice to meet you Joey.
Wow! I can't believe this! This is incredible. I mean you just won an Oscar!
No I didn't.
I think you did.
I think I lost. Three times.
Uh...Cookie?
Okay! We're about an hour away from getting the scene lit. So uh, if you guys don't mind, can we run it a couple of times?
Yeah, sure.
Okay, all right. Let's do it. And...Action!
We have to find the rest of the platoon!
Forget the platoon! The platoon is gone!
What?!
The platoon is dead! Face facts Tony!
So what are we gonna do?! We have no reinforcements! No-no food!
No, we still have food in the basement! I saw potatoes and some dry pasta!
Hang on a minute! Joey, you keep touching your face. Is something wrong?
No. Nope, I uh...I th-I thought it might be kind of a cool character thing. Y'know? He's uh, he's a face toucher.
I don't think so. Let's take it back to Richard's last line. Action!
We may not have any weapons, but we still have food. In the basement I saw potatoes and some dry pasta, and a few tins of tuna!
Honey, we gotta go!
Okay. Here's a question you never have to ask. My dad just called and wanted to know if he could borrow one of your pearl necklaces.
I don't have anything like that, but let me go see if Rachel does.
Yes, include more people in this.
Hey, do you realize that at this time tomorrow we'll be getting married?
Wait a minute! I have a date tomorrow night.
I just, I can't believe that we made it!
Well you don't have to sound so surprised.
I'm sorry but...nothing.
What?
Well...honestly ever since we got engaged I have been waiting for something to, to flip you out.
Honestly? Me too.
Really?
Yeah. Y'know I keep thinking that something stupid is gonna come up and I'll go all...Chandler. But nothing has.
Ohh, I'm so glad. Thank you so much for staying so calm during this. I mean it's really, it's made me stay calm. I coulda been worse!
Okay. I'll be right there.
Hi! If you're calling before Saturday, you've reached Monica and Chandler. But if you're calling after Saturday, you've reached Mr. and Mrs. Bing! Please leave a message for the Bings!
Hey Maureen! Gosh! Hey uh, Chandler? This is my cousin Maureen.
We're the Bings.
Hi! Oh you guys look so beautiful!
Mr. and Mrs. Bing!
Wow Monica! Hey, just so you know I had my uh, older brother chat with Chandler.
What is that?
Well I...I told him that if he ever hurt you I would hunt him down and kick his ass! What?! What?! What is the matter with everybody?! I am serious! I would kick his ass!
Ross, please! My make-up!
Hi.
Chandler!
Mom. Thanks for wearing something.
Oh honey! This is so exciting! I thought we screwed you up so bad this day would never come. Oh and just think. Soon there'll be lots of little Bings.
Mrs. Bing? Here, these are my parents umm, Judy and Jack Geller.
It's lovely to meet you.
So are you his mother or his father?
Jack!
What?! I've never seen one before!
Dad! There's Ross , why don't you go talk to him?
I didn't even have a chance to act as though I'm okay with it!
Hello all!
Hi...dad.
Hi Mr....Bing.
Nora!
Charles.
It-it's so great to see you both here.
Yes! Although, I think we may be seeing a little too much of some people. Aren't you a little old to be wearing a dress like that?
Don't you have a little too much penis to be wearing a dress like that?
Oh my God!
...of course you can kick his ass son.
You could kick anyone's ass you want too.
Thanks you guys.
Oh, Rach! Rach! Umm hey, could you do me a favor and would talk to Chandler's dad and try to keep him away from Chandler's mom?
Yeah! But I don't know what he looks like!
He is the man in the black dress.
Man in the black dress... Hi! I'm Rachel! I'm a friend of Monica and Chandler's!
I'm Amanda.
Oh I get it! A...man...duh!
Can I have everyone's attention please? I'm uh; I'm Ross Geller.
Doctor Ross Geller.
Dad...dad, please! As I was saying umm, I'm Dr. Ross Geller. Uhh, and I'm the best man. And uh, this marriage is doubly special for me umm, because not only is the groom my best friend but uh, the bride is my little sister. And, she's the greatest sister a guy could ask for. So if you'd all please join me in raising a glass to the, the couple we're here to celebrate. To the Bings.
To the Bings!
All right, I'm gonna go steam my wedding dress okay? Who wants the responsibility of making sure nothing happens to it?
I'll do it.
Who wants it? Anybody?
I said I'll do it!
Nobody wants to do it? All right, I'll do it myself.
Monica! I'm not gonna screw it up!
Y'know what? You're right, I'm sorry. Actually you were a big help tonight. Yeah, and thanks for putting my grandmother in the cab and making sure she got to the hotel safely.
Well of course that is what I'm here for!
Okay. Sorry.
Ugh! What grandmother?
Hey! Where have you been?
Oh, taking my parents back to the hotel.
Oh.
What? Are you going back to work?
Yeah.
Nice shades.
Thanks. Yeah, I figure if I wear these in my scenes at least I won't get spit in the eyes, y'know?
And if I remember correctly, Ray Ban was the official sponsor of World War I!
Great! All right. I'll see you later.
Hey, where's Chandler?
Uh, I think he's in Rachel's room. See ya.
Chandler? Chandler?
Hey!
Hi!
Is uh, is Monica here?
She's steaming her dress, why? What's up?
I think Chandler's gone.
What?!
He left that.
Tell Monica I'm sorry.
What's up? Tell Monica I'm sorry. Tell her yourself!
Oh my God! Chandler just left though!
Yeah but, maybe it's not what we think. Maybe it's tell Monica I'm sorry I...drank the last of the milk.
Or maybe he-he was writing to tell her that-that he's changed his name, y'know? Tell Monica I'm sorry.
I think it means he freaked out and left!
Don't be so negative! Good God! Isn't it possible that Sorry is sitting in there right now?!
Okay. Phoebe, I-I think Ross is right. What are we gonna do?
Look-Okay, I'm just gonna-I'm gonna have to go find him and bring him back! Okay? You-you make sure Monica does not find out, okay?
Okay.
Okay but if you don't find him and bring him back, I am gonna hunt you down and kick your ass!
I will, I will find him.
Hey Joey, could you uh, go through these lines with me?
Oh man! They-they just redid my make-up!
Just the last two pages.
All right.
I found the picture!
Picture? What picture?
Could you uh, could you lower your script? I need to see your face so I can uh, play off your reaction.
Okay uh, look I know you're a great actor, okay? And you play all those Shakespeare guys and stuff...
Oh, thanks.
But you're spittin' all over me man!
Well of course I am!
You know you've been spitting on me?!
That's what real actors do! Annunciation is the mark of a good actor! And when you enunciate, you spit!
Wow! Didn't know that.
Great!
Thanks! Okay-okay check it out! Picture? What picture? Eh?
Gunther have you uh, have you seen Chandler?
No. No, I haven't seen him.
Oh damn!
He's getting married tomorrow right?
Yes. Yes. Don't worry. Everything's fine. We'll uh, we'll see you tomorrow at the wedding.
I wasn't invited.
Well then we'll-we'll see you the day after tomorrow. Mom?! Dad?! What-what...what you guys doing here?!
Well you kids talk about this place so much, we thought we'd see what all the fuss is about.
I certainly see what the girls like coming here.
Why?!
The sexy blonde behind the counter.
Gunther?!
Your mother just added him to her list.
What? Your-your list?
Yeah, the list that-of people we're allowed to sleep...
Yes! No-no! I know, I know what the list is! Mom! Look if you see Chandler, could you just let him know I'm looking for him?
And if you see Rita Moreno, let her know I'm looking for her.
Action!
I found the picture!
What picture?!
The picture of my wife! In your pack!
You went through my personal property?
Why do have a picture of Paulette in your pack?!
Because Vincent, we were lovers. For two years!
Cut! Wonderful!
Great scene yeah?
Oh you're awesome! And, in that last speech? You soaked me.
Thanks a lot.
Here's your call sheet for tomorrow.
Oh, I'm-I'm not working tomorrow.
You are now.
No! No! I can't! You gotta get me out of it! I've got plans! Important plans!
Ross said there's still no word from Chandler.
Oh man.
Oh but he did say that they found the grandmother wandering down fifth avenue.
Okay. Well there's one down.
I'm getting married today!!! I think I just cracked a rib. But I don't care because today's my wedding day! My day is finally here!!
Y'know she might not even notice he's gone.
I'm gonna start getting ready!
God! Don't-We can't let her start getting ready! This is too awful! Oh God, but wait she'll be in the gown and then he won't show up and then she's gonna have to take off the gown...
Shhh! Stop it! Stop it Rachel! You can't do this here!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's just...It's just so sad!
Yeah, but you've got to pull yourself together! Monica can't see you like this! Then she'll know something's wrong!
I know. I know. Oh God. There's no tissue! Can you grab me some toilet paper?
Yeah. Oh, that's gone too. This is Monica's bathroom right?!
Oh!
No-no! I-I...I found one.
Okay.
Oh thank you! Oh God! Can I have another one?
Sure. Do you need some floss?
Oh God I just can not imagine what is gonna happen if Chandler doesn't show up!
Oh here's a whole bunch.
Oh, I mean she's gonna be at the wedding waiting for him and people will be whispering, "Oh that poor girl." Y'know? Then she'll have to come back here and live all alone.
Oh my God!
What?
There was a pregnancy test in the garbage, and it's positive. Monica's pregnant. So I guess she won't be totally alone.
Oh my God!
I know! Monica's gonna have a baby! Hey, can this count as her something new?
Oh my God!
Hey, do you think this is why Chandler took off?
No, she had to have just taken that test because I took out the trash last night.
Oh God, this is turning into the worst wedding day ever! The bride is pregnant. The groom is missing. And I'm still holding this.
Okay Phoebe, we can not tell anyone about this.
Right.
Okay?
Yeah, okay. Hey, wait. Do you know what kind of birth control she was using?
No. Why?
Just for the future, this is hardly a commercial for it.
Anything?
No! I talked to Joey on the set, he hasn't heard from him. I-I-I talked to Chandler's parents again!
You told them he was missing?
No! I made it seem like I was just calling to chat. Pretty sure, they both think I'm interested in them.
All right, we've got to tell her he's gone.
No! Hey! Hey! We can't!
Ross, she's gonna start getting ready soon!
Well, can't you at least stall her a little? I'll-I'll go back to some of the places I went last night.
All right, well how much time do you need?
Well how much time before she absolutely has to start getting ready?
One hour.
Give me two.
Then why do you ask?!
Okay, wish me luck.
Okay. I'm going with you.
Why?!
Ross, you're tired. You've been looking all night. And clearly you suck at this.
All right, I'll see you guys later.
Okay. Wait, do you know how you're going to stall her?
I'll figure something out.
All right. Good luck.
Thanks.
Hey! Okay, so I thought we'd start with my make up and then do my hair.
Okay uh, but before you do that. I-I, I need you to talk to me.
About what?
Umm... I'm never gonna getting married!
Yeah you will! The right guy is just around the corner! Okay, are we done with that?
No Monica! I'm serious! Oh, maybe I should just forget about it. Become a lesbian or something.
Any woman would be lucky to have ya.
Well maybe it would make me feel better if I slept with Joey.
Rachel! You okay?
Excuse me, Aaron? Hi! Umm, I have a little problem with the schedules. Originally, I wasn't supposed to work today, and I have this wedding that I really have to be at. It's my best friend's, and I'm officiating so I really can't work past four.
Joey, you gotta stay until the end. We can't stop filming just for you. It's not like it's your wedding.
I'm having surgery!
What?!
Yeah, I-I just made up the stuff about the wedding because I didn't want you to worry about me. But, I'm having surgery today.
What kind of surgery?!
Transplant.
But you're supposed to work on Monday.
Hair transplant.
But you're not bald.
It's not on my head.
Look Joey, there's nothing I can do. Besides, you're probably gonna be out by four anyway. We've just got one short scene. It's just you and Richard, and God knows he's a pro. You'll be fine. Morning Richard.
Hey! You're here! Great! Great! Great! Let's get going buddy, we've got a scene to shoot!
I'm wearing two belts.
Are you drunk?
No!
Yes you are!
All right.
We are never gonna find him! He's one guy in a huge city!
Oh my God! Is that him?
That is an old, Chinese woman!
He could be in disguise, y'know.
Aw, y'know...Y'know, maybe we're-we're just approaching this all wrong. If you're Chandler and-and you wanna hide, where is the last place on Earth people would think you'd go?
So this is your office?
How did you guys find me? I knew I should've hid at the gym!
What the hell are you doing?!
Panicking! And using the Internet to try to prove that I'm related to Monica. How is she?
She's fine. She doesn't know you're gone. And she doesn't have to know, okay? Now come on, we're going home.
No! No! No! I can't do that!
Why not?!
Because if I go home, we're gonna become the Bings! I can't be the Bings!
What's wrong with being the Bings?
The Bings have horrible marriages! They yell. They fight. And they use the pool boy as a pawn in their sexual games!
Chandler, have you ever put on a black cocktail dress and asked me up to your hotel room?
No.
Then you are neither of your parents!
It's not just their marriage! I mean, look at yours. Look at everybody's! The only person that can make marriage work is Paul Newman! And I've met me; I am not Paul Newman. I don't race cars! I don't make popcorn! None of my proceeds go to charity.
But look Chandler, right now, no one has a lower opinion of you than I do. But I totally believe you can do this.
I want to. I love her so much, but I'm afr...It's too huge.
Y'know, okay. You're right. It is huge. So why don't we take it just a little bit at a time? Okay? Umm, forget getting married for a sec; just forget about it. Can you just come home and take a shower?
Well yeah, but then...
Yeah-No-but-but-but-but! We're just gonna go home and take a shower. Now, that's not scary right?
Depends on what you mean by we.
The nights are the hardest. But then the day comes! And that's every bit as hard as the night. And then the night comes again...
The days and nights are hard! I get it! Okay? Look umm, Rachel I'm sorry! I have to start getting ready! I'm getting married today!
I know. At dusk. That's such a hard time for me.
I'm gonna go put my make up on, we have to be at the hotel in an hour!
Okay. But wait!
What?!
Let's go to lunch.
I can't go to lunch!!
Right.
Oh good God! I've fallen down!
What's going on?
Okay. All right. Honey listen. When I tell you what I'm about to tell you, I need you to remember that we are all here for you and that we love you.
Okay, you're-you're really freaking me out.
We can't find Chandler...-'s vest. We can't find Chandler's vest.
How can that be?! Oh wait! Wait! Are you, are you serious?!
Found the vest! I mean we're gonna have to keep an eye on it, y'know make sure we don't lose it again...
Oh!
Oh wow! Okay. Don't scare me like that okay? I mean for a minute there I was like, "Oh my God! The worst has happened!"
I would sooner die in this hellhole then see her back with you!
That can be arranged.
Let's reset.
What?! He got me! Owwwwww!!!
Let's take it from there.
Are you a little off today? It's going terribly slowly.
Look, my best friends are getting married in like an hour. Okay? And I'm the minister. Please! Please! Can you pull it together?
Of course! I'm-I'm sorry. I-I'd hate you to miss anything like that on account of me. I can do this!
Thank you. Thank you.
Still rolling, annnnd action!
I would sooner die in this hellhole then see her back with you!
Now, that can be arranged! Slippery little bugger!
So-so you two were married huh? What happened? You just drift apart?
Here comes the bride.
Oh my God Monica!
I wanna wear this everyday.
You look so beautiful.
I'm so happy for me.
Hello?
Hey! Did Chandler show up yet?
Yeah, we got him back. Everything's fine.
Damnit!
What? Why? Where are you?
I'm still on the set!
Joey! The wedding is in less than an hour!
I know! I'm sorry! The guy's drunk, they won't let me go until we get this.
Oh my God! I'm gonna have to find another minister.
No! No, I'm the minister! All right, look-look, put 'em both on the phone, I'll marry them right now.
Ugh! Joey, I have to go.
Hey! Don't you hang up on me! I'll marry you and me right now! I have the power!
There you go. You put on a tuxedo! Now that wasn't so scary, was it?
No.
I'm telling you, just a little bit at a time.
Yeah okay. Well, what's the next little bit?
Getting married. Okay. Okay. You can, you can do that too! Just like you've done everything else!
Yeah. You're right. Hey I-I can do that.
Yeah.
Okay, excuse me for a minute.
Wh-Hey-Whoa-whoa, where, where you going?!
Ross, I am not gonna run away again! I just want to get a little fresh air.
Okay.
Okay.
Oh fresh air!
Wait! Maybe, maybe you're overreacting! You do that y'know.
Well Phoebe, we gotta do something! Well, y'know. I mean there's no way Joey's gonna make it in time. So I'm gonna through the hotel and see if there's any other weddings going on.
Okay. Oh but don't tell them Monica's pregnant because, they frown on that.
Okay.
Okay.
Anastassakis/Papasifakis wedding, excellent! {It's a good thing Jennifer Aniston is Greek, because she had to pronounce those names. Luckily for me, they were written on a sign.} Congratulations. Mazel Tov! Hi! Oh, great hat. Listen umm, I need you to perform another wedding. Can you do that?
I don't know. Are they Greek Orthodox?
Yeah! Yeah. They're...they're-they're my friends, uh, Monica Stephanopolus and uh, and Chandler Acidofolus.
Hi! Hi! Hi. Has umm, anyone seen Chandler?
I thought he was with you.
He-he was with me umm, we're playing a little game, y'know? Hide and seek.
You can't ask us son, that's cheating.
You're right, thanks for keeping me honest dad.
Well, he better not come by here. He can't see the bride in the wedding dress.
As I recall when we got married, I saw the groom in the wedding dress.
But that was after the wedding, it's not bad luck then.
Honey, it isn't good luck.
Oh my God! Monica!
I know! Hey, how's Chandler doin'?
Great. He's doing great. Don't you worry about Chandler.
Are you okay?
Uh-huh.
Well, you're-you're sweating.
These-these are beads of joy.
Oh that's sweet. Don't touch me.
Uh Phoebe, can I see you for a second?
Yeah!
What's going on?
Chandler's gone again!
Oh my God! Why would you play hide and seek with someone you know is a flight risk?!
Aaron! You gotta let me go. The guy's hammered!
I'm sorry Joey, as long as he's here and he's conscious we're still shooting.
You wouldn't happen to have a very big fork?
So I uh, I just talked to the director. That's it, we're done for the day.
Well have we finished the scene?
Yeah! You...you were wonderful.
As were you.
So I got your car, it's right outside.
Why? Are we done for the day?
That's what you told me.
Oh, thank you. You're welcome.
No-no-no! We gotta go! Come on! Here we go.
Is that my ass?
There he is!!
What?
Hey! Oh!
You're not getting away this time mister! Unless you want that ass kicking we talked about!
Ross!
Hiiii-Ya!! I'm serious! You're not walking out on my sister!
That's right! I'm not!
Then where the hell have you been?!
I know about Monica.
You know?!
What?
Yeah, I heard you and Rachel talking.
What?! What?! Talking about what?!
You don't know?
Know what-If somebody doesn't tell me what's going on right now...
What? You'll hi-ya?
Monica's pregnant.
Oh my God. Oh my God! And you're-you're...you're not freaking out?
Well I was! Then I went down to the gift shop because I was out of cigarettes...
Cigarettes?!!
Big picture please! So I was in the gift shop, and that's when I uh, saw this. New York.) Yeah, y'know what? I thought anything that can fit into this, can't be scary.
Well you obviously didn't see Chucky 3.
But come on, look at how cute and small this is! So I got it to give Monica so she'd know I was okay.
Dude.
Way to go son! I knew you'd find him!
Our little boy is getting married.
Oh look at you! So handsome!
You look beautiful mom. You look beautiful too dad. I love you both. I'm so glad you here.
Are you Chandler?
Are you Joey?
Huh. This is nice.
What?
I've never walked down the aisle knowing it can't end in divorce.
Oh I wish you're grandmother had lived to see this.
She's right there.
Not that old crow, my mother. Congratulations darling.
I love you sweetheart.
You look beautiful. Is this new?
Not now.
Okay.
Who is this?
I am Father Kalebasous.
He's Greek Orthodox.
As are you...
Let us begin. Dearly beloved...
That's my line! I can take it from here, thanks. Dearly beloved, I'm sorry I'm a little late. You may be confused by this now, but you won't be Memorial Day weekend 2002. Well, let's get started before the groom takes off again. Huh? We are gathered here today, to join this man and this woman in the bonds of holy matrimony. I've known Monica and Chandler for a long time, and I can not imagine two people more perfect for each other. And now, as I've left my notes in my dressing room. We shall proceed to the vows. Monica?
He took off?
Go on! Go on.
Chandler, for so long I...I wondered if I would ever find my prince, my soul mate. Then three years ago, at another wedding I turned to a friend for comfort. And in stead, I found everything that I'd ever been looking for my whole life. And now...here we are...with our future before us...and I only want to spend it with you, my prince, my soul mate, my friend. Unless you don't want to. You go!
Chandler?
No, that's okay. Monica I thought this was going to be the most difficult thing I ever gonna had to do. But when I saw you walking down that aisle I realized how simple it was. I love you. Any surprises that come our way it's okay, because I will always love you. You are the person I was meant to spend the rest of my life with. You wanna know if I'm sure?
You may not kiss the bride. So, I guess by the powers vested in my by the state of New York and the Internet guys, I now pronounce you husband and wife. Oh wait! Do you take each other?
I do.
I do.
Yeah you do!
Rings?
Aw crap! Okay-uh...uh let's-let's do the rings.
We good? Yeah? Good? Once again, I pronounce you husband and wife. Now kiss her again.
I love you. And I know about the baby.
What baby?
Our baby.
We have a baby?
Phoebe found your pregnancy test in the trash.
I didn't take a pregnancy test.
Then...who did?
Oh and they're gonna have a baby.
Uh-huh.
Great. Great! Just give me a sec to change film.
Okay.
Okay, I know I'm not supposed to know, but I do. And I'm so excited for you!
What? What's going on?
Monica's pregnant!
Oh my God! Is that why you guys had to get married?!
Guys! I'm not pregnant.
Ah. Slow swimmers?
What?! What do you mean? You-you-you're not pregnant?
You didn't tell anybody I was did you?!
No! I'll be right back.
Now why don't we get a shot of just Monica and the bloody soldier.
Oh, about that. Joey, you have to change before the party.
I can't! I-I don't have any other clothes here.
Find some! Please! Anything that doesn't say I-I died tragically in France.
Well then why don't we see the bride and the groom and the bridemaids.
Okay. Hey Mon, why did you tell the guys you weren't pregnant?
Because I'm not.
We found your test in the trash, if you're not pregnant--It's because I am.
What?! What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?
Yes, I...I am with child. And I didn't want to say anything because it's your day; I didn't want to steal your thunder.
Wait a minute! So you told people I was pregnant?! Does this look like a conversation that I want to remember?!
Who's the father?
Yeah!
I can't say.
Why?!
Why not?
I can't say because he's famous.
Oh my God, who is it?!
Phoebe, come on, you have to tell us.
Okay, okay. It's James Brolin. James Brolin is the father of my baby.
As in Barbara Streisand's husband James Brolin?
What?! Well he never said that to me!
Why don't we have Monica step away and we'll get Chandler and the bridemaids.
How about just the bridemaids?
Y'know I am the groom right? I was told it was kinda big deal.
It is.
For you.
Oh my God!
Oh, thank you for doing that. I just can't deal with this just quite yet.
So instead you told me Monica was pregnant.
You said that she was, I just didn't disagree with you.
Sneaky.
Oh yeah.
Smile ladies.
Oh! Oh by the way?
Uh-hmm.
James Brolin?
Oh, I know. I could only think of two names, him and Ed Begley Jr. and then I remembered he's gay.
Ed Begley Jr. is not gay.
Really?!
Thank you very much! Ladies and gentlemen, it gives me great pleasure to introduce to you for the very first time, Mr. and Mrs. Chandler Bing!
Before we go out there I've got a present for ya.
Honey, I'm going to put my hand in your pocket!
No?
No.
I've been taking dancing lessons.
What?!
Yeah, the last six weeks. I wanted this to be a moment you will never forget.
Oh that is so sweet!
So? Would you care to join me in our first dance as husband and wife?
Yes.
What's the matter?
I don't know, it's these new shoes, they're all slippery.
Well, are you going to be able to do this?
Not well.
Well, the good news is, I don't think anyone's looking at us.
So, are you ready to talk about it?
No.
Now?
No!
Okay, we'll talk about something else then.
Thank you.
Who's the father?!
Ugh! Look honey y'know what? I haven't told him yet, so until I do I don't think I should tell anybody else.
Yeah. That's fine. That's fair. Is it Tag?
Phoebe!!
Okay, I'm sorry. I'll stop.
Okay.
Is it Ross? It's Ross isn't it-Oh my God, it's Joey!
Honey, stop it! I am not going to tell you until I tell him.
Ah-hah! At least we know it's a him.
Oh sweet Lord.
I'm sorry! Okay? I went down to the gift shop and it's either this or a bathrobe! Look, what's more important, the way I'm dressed or me being with you on your special day?
Honey, I'm not even going to pretend I was listening. Hey! Hey!
Hi. I'm uh, I'm Ross. I don't, I don't believe we've met. I'm Monica's older brother.
Oh hi, I'm, I'm Mona from her restaurant.
Oh! Hello uh, Mona from her restaurant. Mona, wow what a, what a beautiful name.
You think so? I've always kinda hated it.
Aw come on, Mona Lisa?
Uh-huh.
Mona umm...Clickclocken. The famous botanist? Huh? Oh no she's uh-well she's dead now. No, supposedly she was once quite the hottie of the plant world.
Really?! Well see? I never knew about her.
Linda Clickclocken. So what uh, what-what table are you at? Oh, uh me too.
Oh good. Now there'll be someone there who likes my name.
Yes there will. Oh guess what, Molly Gilbert you've just been bumped up to table one. And if it's all right with you I'm gonna take your place at table six-Martin Clickclocken.
That's better, now just bend your arms a little more. There you go. Okay, look straight ahead. Now this time I want you to really put your ass into it.
Chandler darling! Look, my date has finally arrived. I'd like you to meet Dennis Phillips.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
Dennis is a dear old friend and a fantastic lover.
Bravo Dennis thanks for pleasing my mother so.
Oh, I'm so sorry I missed the ceremony, I was stuck at auditions.
Oh yes, Dennis is directing a new Broadway show.
I don't believe we've met, Joey Tribbiani.
Dennis Phillips
Wow, I've admired your work for years. You-you've done some really amazing stuff.
Oh, thank you. Well if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go get myself a drink. Be back in a moment.
Wow Dennis Phillips! That's great! How did you guys meet?
Well, it's a funny story.
Funny: Ha-Ha Or Funny
Thank you, thank you very much. If everyone will please take your seats, dinner will be served.
Hey! Uh, I thought, I thought you were at table six.
No, nine.
Oh see, before you uh, when you showed it to me you-you held it that way which uh, which was misleading. Well I'm... Hello.
Chandler. Will you see if your mom can give my resume to Dennis Phillips? 'Cause if I can get in a Broadway show then I would've done it all, film, television, and theater. The only think left would be radio, and that's just for ugly people.
What size shoes do you wear?
Uh, eleven, eleven and a half.
Great, because my shoes are giving me a little problem on the dance floor, can I borrow the boots from your costume?
Uh, I don't even really know where I left those. Sorry.
Those aren't eleven and a half.
Okay fine! I'm a seven! All right, I have surprisingly small feet. But the rest of me is good, I'll show ya!
Can you believe Phoebe got pregnant?!
Oh y'know what honey? Let's not talk about that right now?
This is so huge.
Sure, but come on, as big as your wedding?
Of course not nothing is. Between me and you...
Yeah.
...in this day and age how dumb do you have to be to get pregnant?
Hey! Y'know, sometimes you can do everything right, everyone can wear everything they're supposed to wear, and one of those little guys just gets through!
How?
I don't know! Maybe they have tools.
Well I-I talked to and uh, she's definitely going to have this baby. Y'know, she said she was gonna raise it on her own.
Well, maybe that's, maybe that's really brave.
Maybe. I just hope she realizes how hard it's gonna be.
Maybe she hasn't really thought it through that well.
Well, there's a lot to think about. I mean, how is she, how is she going to handle this financially? How is she going to juggle work? Does she realize she's not going to have a date again for the next eighteen years?
I don't know.
Are you okay?
Uh-hmm. I'm just thinking about Phoebe; poor knocked up Phoebe.
Champagne?
Oh yes! Thank you very much! Oh that's-that's actually how the French drink it.
Well, I just got off the phone with my lover, James Brolin...
Oh really?!
Yes, and apparently he is married to some singer, but he said he would leave her for me. And I said, "James, James Brolin, are you sure?" James Brolin said...
Rachel's really the one who's pregnant.
What?! Why bother?
How do you feel?
I don't know. I don't know how I feel. This is all happening so fast. I have to make all these decisions that I don't want to make. Somebody just take this away from me!!
Calm down. Maybe you're not pregnant.
What?!
When I got pregnant with the triplets, I took that test like three times just to make sure.
Yes! Maybe it's a false positive. Are you sure you peed on the stick right?
How many ways are there to do that?
I'm-I'm just saying, don't freak out until you're a hundred percent sure.
All right, I'll-I'll take it again when I get home.
You-you gotta take it now. Come on, do it as a present to me.
Okay. Thank you.
Okay.
I'll run out and get you one.
Oh, you guys are so great.
Oh, wait a minute! Who's is the father?!
Oh no, she won't tell us.
Oh, come on it's my wedding! That can be my present.
Wh-Hey, I just gave you peeing on a stick.
See? This is why you register.
It was the chair again! Okay? I'm not doing it! It what-look, I don't-y'know what-eh-eh... Hi.
Hi!
Umm, would you like to dance?
Sure.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Oh great!
Dr. Geller?
I wasn't farting! Uh, a little game from our table. Yes?
Dr. Geller, will you dance with me?
Oh umm, well uh, maybe-maybe later. Right now, I'm about to dance with this lady.
Okay.
Ohhhh!
Uh, unless! Unless, uh this lady wouldn't mind letting you go first.
I'd be happy to. You are very sweet.
Yes I-I am. In fact umm hey, why don't we try it my special way? You can dance on my feet.
Sure!
Yeah? Hop on. Is the pretty lady looking?
Uh-huh.
Keep dancing.
And the world will never know.
Hey! Did you talk to Dennis about me yet?
Yes, I told him how talented you were. I told him all about Days Of Our Lives.
No-no! No! No! You don't tell a Broadway guy that! Now he just thinks I'm a soap actor.
But you're not just a soap actor. You are a soap actor with freakishly tiny feet.
Hey!
Thank you.
No-no, thank you Miranda.
Melinda!
All right.
How cute was that?
Oh-oh, were you, were you watching?
Can I go next?
What? Of course you can! Hop on!
Okay, but I get to hop on after her.
I am so gonna score.
What?
I like your bow.
I'd like to propose a toast. To Monica and Chandler, the greatest couple in the world. And my best friends. Now, my when I first found out they were getting married I was, I was a little angry. I was like, "Why God? Why? How can you take them away from me?!" But then I thought back over all our memories together, some happy memories. And-and there was some sad memories. I'm sorry. And-and some scared memories-Whoa! Eh? And then, and then I realized I'll always be their friend, their friend who can speak in many dialects and has training in stage combat and is willing to do partial nudity. Oh! To the happy couple!
Thank you.
That was very nice Ashley.
Can we do it again?
No-no.
So, is it my turn now?
I'm next!
Oh!
Uh, that's okay. You can dance with her first.
Oh, you-you sure? Okay. Okay. So what's uh, what's your name.
Gert!
That's, that's pretty. Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What are you doing there Gert?
Dancing on your feet! Like the other girls did it.
Okay. Hop on Gert.
Why aren't you moving your feet?
I'm trying.
Faster! You're not going fast enough!
Maybe I should stand on your feet!
So did you uh, happen to catch my toast up there?
Oh my God, that was for my benefit?
Well, I'd like to think there was something for everyone. Look, I know you're casting for this new show...
Look umm Joey, I-I don't think you're quite right for this project.
Oh, see that's where you're wrong. Whatever it is I can do it. And if didn't see it up there, just-just try me.
It's an all Chinese cast. Can you be Chinese?
Well I'm not proud of this, but...
Oh my God! No-no-no! Please! Please! Don't-don't-don't!
Hey, are you ready to get back on the dance floor?
Did it turn into sand?
Ohh come on, I love this song! Come on, you'll be fine.
No. No, I won't. Do you know why I took all those lessons? See, for the first time I didn't want you to be embarrassed to be seen on the dance floor with some clumsy idiot.
Oh sweetie, you can never embarrass me. Okay, you can easily embarrass me. But come on, it doesn't matter. All right? I married you! So I want to dance on my wedding night with my husband. Come on. Just try not to move your feet at all. There you go.
Chandler, I'm gonna have you arrested.
Why?
You stole my moves.
How much longer?
30 seconds.
30 seconds, okay.
Did I miss it? Rachel, I-I want you to know that, if it's positive, we're gonna...
Oh I know. I know.
It's time.
No!!
Go ahead Rach.
Oh wait! Y'know what? I can't, I can't look at it. I can't. Somebody else tell me, somebody tell me.
Okay.
Okay.
Umm, it's negative.
What?
It's negative.
Oh. Oh. Well there you go. Whew! That is-that's great-that is really great-great news. Y'know 'cause the whole not being ready and kinda the financial aspects, all that. Whew. Wow, this is so just the way it was supposed to be. God.
Well... Well, great.
Here.
Thanks. God this is so stupid! How could I be upset over something I never had? It's negative?
No, it's positive.
What?!
It's-it's not negative, it's positive.
Are you sure?
Well yeah, I lied before.
Oh!
Oh God...
Now you know how you really feel about it.
Oh-oh, that's a risky little game!
Are you really gonna do this?
Yeah. I'm gonna have a baby. I'm gonna have a baby. I'm gonna have a baby!
With who?
Ah, it's still not the time.
I just didn't see the fast song coming.
Shh. Shh. Don't try to talk, we'll get you up to your room, we'll soak your feet, you'll be okay.
Oh, thank you.
That is so sweet!
Yeah.
No, I mean it. There are so few genuinely nice guys out there.
Tell me about it, I feel like I'm holding down the fort all by myself.
It's Joey right?
Yeah.
Wait a minute! No! I'm the nice one! I'm the one who danced with the kids all night! How...How small are your feet?!
Listen y'know what sir? For the last time, I don't care what the computer says, we did not take a bag of Mashuga nuts from the mini-bar and we did not watch Dr. Do-Me-A-Little!
Hey!
Oh! Joey uh, were you in our room last night?
No. I was told the name of the movie would not appear on the bill!
Hi! We're checking out of the bridal suite.
That's right. I'm no longer a bride. I'll never be a bride again. Now, I'm just someone's wife!
And I'm the happiest guy in the world! Oh honey, come on don't be upset. We still have so much to look forward to!
Oh yeah, right.
We got the honeymoon.
That's not 'til Thursday.
The wedding pictures?
They won't be ready for weeks.
Not the disposable cameras from the tables.
That's true! I knew I married you for a reason!
I'll tell you what, I will go get them developed and you can go home.
Okay.
What? What did you take a picture of?
Nothing! It was something.
Okay Ross has the cameras, has he checked out yet?
Are you joking? Check out is not 'til noon and he has a good eleven minutes left.
Oh.
Ross has never checked out of a room a minute before he had to.
Yeah, one time, when we were dating, uh we got a late checkout, he got so excited it was the best sex we ever had. Until y'know, he screamed out Radisson at the end.
Okay, well I'm gonna get Ross, get the cameras, and get them developed. 32 Joe. You're 32!
Here's a copy of your bill.
Oh thanks. Champagne, strawberries...Oh my God! I can't believe Chandler ordered porn on our wedding night!
Yeah, that's sad. Mashuga nut?
Hi.
Hey. Soaps? Shampoos? Are you really taking all this stuff?
Why not? It's built into the price of the room.
Yeah but you don't need--What is this?
Thread!
Score! Where are the disposable cameras?
What disposable cameras?
The cameras? Remember last night I told you to take them?
No you didn't.
Yes! Remember? Right before we cut the cake, I went up to you and I said...
Oh-oh yeah, you-you came up to me and asked if I could do you a favor, and my Uncle Murray came up to you and handed you a check. And then you said, "Why do they call it a check? Why not a Yugoslavian?" Yeah, then you did that.
So you don't have the cameras?!
No. Sorry man.
So? What? What? They're gone! Monica's gonna freak!
Well, I'm sure they're still somewhere here in the hotel. I'll-I'll help you look for them.
Great.
In-in three minutes.
Hey!
Hey!
Are you gonna open the presents without Chandler?
No! But, they're callin' out to me! I mean this little guy even crawled up into my lap. Oh come on, Chandler wouldn't mind if I opened just one present! What do you think it is?
A little mirror that when you look into it you see yourself as an old woman.
A tiny salt shaker!!!
Ohhh! My God! For tiny salt!
Oh wow! Okay. Well that was fun.
Oh yeah.
Good. Okay, I'm just gonna wait for Chandler to open the rest of them.
Okay.
Whew. Although y'know, this is part of a salt and pepper set. I mean... I guess y'know it may just count as a half a present. What do you think?
Well I guess it's okay to open one more if it's part of a set. Y'know, it's probably this one.
Or this one!
Hi.
Hey, how are you feelin'? Any morning sickness?
Shh-shh-shh! The guys don't know yet do they?
No! Joey and Ross don't know anything and Chandler still thinks that Phoebe's pregnant.
Yeah that's right Chandler does still think I'm pregnant. He hasn't asked me how I'm feeling or offered to carry my bags. Boy, I feel bad for the woman who ends up with him. After you of course.
Don't worry I promise that you will only have to be pregnant for a few more hours, 'cause I'm going to tell the father today.
Ooh, is it someone in this building? Is it that tall guy from the first floor?
Ew! No!
What?! I think he's cute.
Well then you have his baby.
Believe me I'm trying.
Wow. Y'know it is so weird. I mean, you're gonna tell this guy today and he has no idea what's gonna happen.
Yeah. You're just gonna knock on his door and change his life forever. You're like Ed McMahon except without the big check, or the raw sexual magnetism.
Yeah. Uh-huh, I guess it is pretty big news.
Pretty big? It's huge! God, this guy doesn't have a clue! He's just walking down the street thinking, 'I had sex with Rachel Green. I rock!' then bam! He's a father and everything's different.
Well it's only different if he wants it to be. I mean, I'm not gonna ask him for anything.
Okay. Then he still has this huge decision to make. Now he's walking around thinking, 'Do I want to be a dad?' and then bam!
What was that bam?
I don't. He got...he-he-he-he's hit by a bus.
Hey!
Hey Joey, what would you do if someone that you slept with told you that she was pregnant?
Who called here? Did she sound blond? Huh? Did-did-did she have an accent? I gotta make a call! I shoulda never walked into that Sunglass Hut!
Oh Joey! Joey! No, it's not you! You didn't get anybody pregnant!
Oh. Why would you scare me like that? What the hell is going on? Is somebody pregnant?
Oh yeah. That's me.
Oh my God Pheebs! You're gonna have a baby?
Yes. Yes I am. Oh my God, I'm gonna have a baby!
Whoa, wait a minute. Who's the father?
You don't know him. It's not important. He wants nothing to do with me or the baby.
Well who is this guy?! Huh? Who is he? 'Cause I will track him down and kick his ass!
David Lynn.
David Lynn! David Lynn! David Lynn!!
Who's David Lynn?
Oh some guy from my gym. A little annoying.
Chandler?
Hey! Did you find the cameras?
No. Did you?
Yes! And that's why I'm under the table. Celebrating.
Well I checked in the uh, lost and found, I talked to the manager, no-one's turned them.
Well this is great. Y'know, those cameras were the only thing that was gonna cheer Monica up today, she's really depressed.
Now you guys just got married, why is she so depressed?
All my energy is going into not asking that question. I can't believe I screwed this up!
I'm sorry man. Here's a thought. This is the same ballroom. There's a band. There's gonna be plenty of dressed up people.
Are you suggesting we dance our troubles away?
No-no-no, I'm saying we-we buy more of this at the gift shop, throw our tuxes back on, and take a few pictures. All we have to do is make sure not to get anybody else's faces.
Are you serious?
I'm just thinking about your new bride at home. Okay? Do-do you really want to start your life together by letting her down?
Marriage advice? Really?!
I'm telling you, this looks exactly like your wedding! Aren't these the same flowers?
I don't know, Monica picked out the flowers.
What about the chairs?
She picked those out too.
How about the place settings?
That was her.
What did you do?
I was in charge of the cameras! Gift shop?
Hmm.
Hey! Ooh, did you do it yet?
Not yet.
Oh, well what are you doing here? Are you about to do it? Is it Gunther?
No! Phoebe, it's not Gunther.
Thank God, 'cause that hair on a baby...
Phoebe the father is not here okay? I haven't told him yet and I don't think I can tell him at all now!
Why not?
I don't know, let me think. I was walking down the street thinking, 'I'm gonna tell the father today' and then bam!
Bus?
No, you! Phoebe you freaked me out. You kept saying how huge this all is!
Well-well but it is huge.
I know, but I was just thinking about how huge this is for me. I didn't even go to how huge this was going to be for the father.
You're thinking about this way too much. Just tell him and get it over with. It's like, it's like ripping off this Band-Aid. Quick and painless, watch. Oh mother of...See?
Ooh-ooh-ooh! Are we opening presents?
No! No! I shouldn't have even opened these! I mean I-Joey I am out of control!! Joey, you have to do me a favor. No matter what I say, no matter what I do, please do not let me open another present! Okay?
Okay.
Give me one more.
Okay.
Hey.
Oh good, uh you're here. Uh Pheebs? Listen uh sit down. I-I got something I want to say.
All right.
Umm, now uh... It's a scary world out there, especially for a single mom. Y'know, now I always thought you and I had a special bond so... Phoebe Buffay, will you marry me?
Oh my God! Joey!
Hell yeah! I'll marry you!
You can't marry him!
Hey lady, your day's over! It's my turn!
Phoebe!
Why?! Why can't she marry me?!
I can and I will!
She's not pregnant. It's Rachel. Rachel's the one who's pregnant.
Oh my God.
Hey!
Phoebe I think he would notice if you didn't have a baby in nine months!
It's Joey!
Now I can't believe it! What? Rachel's pregnant? Who's the father?
We don't know.
Ohh... I wonder if that dude.
There's a dude?
Yeah.
Who? Who is it?
About a month ago this guy spent the night with Rachel, I didn't see who it was but...
Was that story over?
The guy left this.
Oh my God! I know who the father is...
People have got to finish their stories!
Uh, excuse me? Could you take a picture of us?
Oh! Of course.
Uh, would you take one of us?
Uhh... Yeah sure. Click!
It didn't click.
I heard it. I heard it.
But there was no flash.
Why won't you take our picture?
Oh yeah. I'll take, I'll take your picture.
Uh, your finger was covering the lens.
Who are you? Ansel Adams?! Get outta here!
Look, I feel really bad about how I freaked you out before, so I called the father and asked him to meet you here so you can tell him. Go!
What? Hey wait a minute! Phoebe, how do you even know who the father is?
I may play the fool at times, but I'm a little more than a pretty blond girl with an ass that won't quit. I believe this belongs to the father of your baby.
Oh God... Oh, he's in there right now?
Uh-huh. Now you can turn around or you can go in there and rip the Band-Aid off. What to you want to do?
Uh, let's rip!
Really? Are you sure?
Oh Phoebe!
Okay, sorry. Yeah.
Hey Rach.
Why don't you go up on stage. I'll get a picture of you doing the speech.
Okay. Okay!
Will the owner of a 1995 Buick LeSabre please see the front desk? Your car is about to be towed.
That's my car!
A '95 LeSabre?!
Yes!
A green LeSabre?
Yes!
I'm sorry, I meant a blue LeSabre.
Yes! Green-blue!
Well go! Go move it!
Okay, you ready for the last picture?
Yeah.
Get ready to run. Congratulations on your wedding.
So, what's this about?
Rachel has something that she wants to tell you and umm, I believe that this is your red sweater.
No. This is my red sweater.
Oh no. Could I get anyone a coffee or...poison? No? Just for me? Okay.
What's going on Rach?
Nothing! Phoebe kinda made a mistake. But y'know you do wear that sweater a lot, are you involved in some kind of dare?
Y'know, I'm actually glad Phoebe called. I know we broke up because you thought I wasn't mature enough, but I've really grown up and think we should get back together.
Oh, it's just not the right time.
It is the right time.
Okay.
I'm ready for more.
Tag...
Come on Rach, let's give it another try.
I'm having a baby.
Oh.
You can go.
Thank you.
I don't know how any of these got opened?!
You opened them all?
I know! I know! I am a terrible person! I mean, Chandler is never going to trust me with anything ever again!
Oh hey! You got my parent's gift!
Yeah. What is that?
Well, I don't know. I think it does something to salami.
Hey! How'd it go?
Yeah. What-what did Tag say?
Tag is not the father! And Joey knows now?
I do Rach. I do, and I so happy for you.
Oh wow, you didn't even try to unhook my bra!
So are you ever gonna tell whoever it is?
No, I will. I'm just not up for it tonight.
Hey Rach listen, no matter what this guy says I want you to know you're not gonna be alone in this.
I'm not?
Listen I uh... It's a scary world out there especially if you're a single mom. Y'know, I always felt like you and I have this-this special bond. Y'know? So, Rachel Green will you marry me?
What?
What?!
What?!!
Pheebs, give me the ring back!
No!!
No! Joey, oh you're so sweet. You're so-so sweet, honey. But I'm not, I'm not looking for a husband.
I understand.
Now, if you will excuse me I am going to go and lie down.
I can't say that didn't hurt. But I'll take you back Joey Tribbiani.
Uh yeah. Pheebs, listen about that. I only offered...
Ooh! A Salami Buddy!
There you go!
We're back!
Great! We're hangin' in the kitchen! Let's stay in the kitchen!
It's picture time.
Now you are going to love these.
Here's a picture of Ross. And that's me. And that's me and Ross. Oh-ho, that is a picture of our first kiss as a married couple.
Wow! That is a great picture!
Eh?
Yeah! Oh and interesting because I found the cameras in one of our bags!
Huh, didn't see that coming.
Okay, so this isn't a picture of our first, but it is a picture of my first kiss with...with this lady. Which by the look on your face I'm sure you'll remember. So we don't need--There's no need to have this picture. How about I take the real pictures and get them developed right now.
That would be a good idea.
Okay. You opened all the presents without me?! I thought we were supposed to do that together!
You kissed another woman!
Call it even?!
Okay!
Well, I'm gonna go get these in some water.
Wait you stole those from these people's wedding?
No-no, I took them from the hotel lobby. Yeah, they think they can charge me for some dirty movie and a bag of Mashuga nuts, they got another think coming. Hey! My sweater! I've been looking for this for like a month!
Oh my God!!
Oh my God!
Hey! How you doing?
Good! Good, long time no see.
Yeah.
Like your sweater.
Oh hey, right back at ya.
Oh, it's crazy about Rachel huh?
Yeah. She-Well, she's one crazy lady?
So whose is it?
Umm, I don't some Italian guy. Come on, read your own label. See you later.
Okay.
He is so weird.
Hey! Babe! Aren't you excited we're going on our honeymoon?
Yeah I am!
Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama...
That's right. Get it out of your system while we're alone.
Hey!
Yeah! Have a great honeymoon!
I'd better go pack.
Oh no, I already packed. The only thing I couldn't find though was your Speedo.
A Speedo? Uh, I don't have a Speedo. I'm gonna go pack my regular long bathing suit.
Oh good you're still here!
Hey!
I want to tell you to have a good honeymoon!
Thank you.
And I also wanted you guys to know that I am telling the father today. What? What? What?
We know its Ross!
How?! How do you know?
It was his sweater, but-Oh my God!
Oh, I so wanted Ross to know first, but I'm so relieved you guys know.
This is so great! And I'm gonna be your baby's aunt!
I know!
Me too!
I'm gonna be an uncle! Come here!
You're all gonna be aunts and uncles.
Yeah, but I'm the only one related by blood.
Okay. Great! So now that you guys all know you can help me. Give me some advice on how I'm gonna tell Ross!
Well, what were you gonna say?
Well I was gonna tell him that I'm-I'm gonna have the baby and he can be as involved as he wants.
Well that, that sounds good.
Yeah but how do I start? I mean, what's-what's the first thing that I say? Okay great! Thanks.
Hey! Good luck!
Yeah, bye.
Bye.
Hey, what was that all about?
Well I guess there is no harm in telling you now, Rachel and Ross are gonna have a baby.
What?! I didn't even know that-Why didn't you tell me?! Why am I talking like this?!
I didn't think you could keep it a secret.
What?! I am an excellent secret keeper. I have kept all of our secrets.
What secrets?
Oh no-no Joey, I am not going to tell you because I am an excellent secret keeper.
You'll tell me later?
You already know.
Oh, it's so romantic to send people off on their honeymoon.
Y'know, Monica and Chandler are married. Ross and Rachel are having a baby. Maybe you and I should do something.
All in good time my love. All in good time. Oh shoot! I left my guitar in their apartment. Well you can let me in later.
I don't have a key, they took mine to give to you.
What?! They took mine to give to you!
Why would they take away our keys?
Maybe they don't trust us.
No that's not it. They let me keep my key the last time they were out of town.
You mean the time you broke the ketchup bottle and cleaned it up with Monica's guest towels?
Hey, I washed those!
No you didn't.
Yeah that didn't sound like me.
Well, what am I gonna do? I really need my guitar!
Yeah, I have stuff in there too.
What stuff?
Monica's chicken parm! I'll take care of it. Hey Mr. Treeger, it's Joey Tribbiani. Listen, I need to get into Monica and Chandler's apartment. It's an emergency. Uhh, gas leak! Yeah oh, and bring garlic bread.
Hey!
Did Rachel find you?
No why?
Oh she was looking for you.
Oh well, I guess I'll catch up with her later.
Well, she really wanted to talk to you now.
Yeah, it seemed pretty important.
Oh no.
What?
I think I might know what this is about.
Really?
Yeah. Uh, uh we promised we weren't gonna tell anybody this but uh, about a month ago Rachel and I slept together.
And?
Wow! I thought you would be a little more shocked.
Oh sorry. And?!
Well, we-we said we'd just do it that one time but, but now I think she may wanna start things up again.
Yeah, I don't think that's what it is.
Why? What-what else could it be?
Oh wow, I don't feel well.
I'm telling you. I'm telling you. That's what it is. No wonder she was looking at me all funny during the wedding. She didn't say anything to you?
Maybe it's something you ate?
Please, just-just, just go and talk to Rachel.
Yeah, I guess I should. Man, y'know what I have to realize? Maybe I'm just not the type of guy women can have just one night with. Y'know, they-they always seem to want a little bit more. I should remember that.
Next?
They're kissing let's just go around them.
Oh honey, leave them alone, they're in love.
I'm in love too! But in an orderly fashion.
Next?
Hi! Can you do that and walk? 'Cause she said, "Next."
Sorry. We didn't hear you; we're on our honeymoon.
Oh, let me see what I can do. There are some first class seats available.
Did you hear that?! They bumped them up to first class because they are on their honeymoon! Come on! Let's act like we're on our honeymoon.
We are on our honeymoon.
Grab my ass!
Next?
Hi, sorry. I almost didn't hear you, because y'know I'm just so in love with my new husband. We're on our honeymoon.
Congratulations. Okay, Mr. Bing you'll be in 25J and Mrs. Bing you'll be in 25K.
Oh no, you see we're on our honeymoon. So umm, can you do your little thing and bump us up to first class?
I'm sorry, all our first class seats are taken. That couple got the last two.
You see, if we'd gone around them like I said, we-She would've given us those tickets. Damnit!
25J and K, any chance those aren't together?
I still can't believe they took away my key. You trust me with yours.
Of course I do! And I'm gonna give it back to you as soon as they're done with it at the key shining place.
What the hell is that?
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Treeger, what are you doing?
You said there was a gas leak in here.
Well why don't you use your key?
Because by the time I find it on this thing , the whole place might have exploded. If that happens at another building that I manage, people are gonna start asking questions. Come on! Hurry up.
Oh! We could have done that.
Look at that! Look at that! They're going into the first class lounge! Do you know what they have in there?
No.
Me neither! We have to get in!
Just act like you belong.
Oh my God! Oranges!
Shh! Nice to see you again.
Uh sir, may I see your tickets please?
Yes, of course.
I'm sorry, would you move your thumb? I can't see the seat number.
Oh that's all right, I have it memorized. It's 1A.
Sir, this is not a first class ticket. I'm sorry.
Apology accepted. Excuse us.
Sir! I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
Fine. Go! Go! Go!
Hi!
Hi.
Hi. Umm, I think there's something that we really need to talk about.
I think we do. Why don't we go inside? Look uh, I know why you're here.
You do?
Yeah, and to save you from any embarrassment umm, I think maybe I should talk first.
Okay.
Okay. Uh, Ross and Rachel. Rachel and Ross. That's been one heck of a see-saw hasn't it?
What?
I mean look, that-that one night we had was fun and...and certainly passionate, but don't you think it's better if we just stayed friends?
Seriously. What?!
Okay. Okay. Y'know what? If you want to, we can do it one more time. I mean I'd-I'd be okay with that. In fact, I have some time right now.
Okay, y'know what? Can I, can I talk now?
Oh sure.
I'm pregnant. Ross? Ross? Okay, whenever you're ready. And you're the father by the way-but you got that...
Can I get you some water?
I'm good. I'm good.
Ross, there is no pressure on you. Okay? I mean you can as involved as you want.
Yeah, I need uh... I'm just-I don't know-I don't understand, umm, how this happened? We-we used a condom.
I know. I know, but y'know condoms only work like 97% of the time.
What? What? What?!! Well they should put that on the box!!!
They do!
No they don't!!! Well they should put it in huge black letters!!!!
Okay Ross come on let's just forget about the condoms.
Oh well I may as well have!
Listen, y'know what? I was really freaked out too when I found out...
Freaked out? Hey no, I'm not freaked out! I'm indignant! As a consumer!
Y'know what? Let's, let's talk later.
No! No! I want to talk now! Okay? I-In fact, I am going to talk to the president of the condom company!
Okay, y'know maybe I should come back...
Shh! Shh! Shh!
Okay.
Yeah I'll press 1!
I've looked everywhere. There's no gas leak.
Huh. So then I can heat this up?
Anyway uh, I'll get moving on that new door.
Oh great! And listen, could you do us a favor and not tell Chandler and Monica about this? 'Cause y'know umm, they don't-they don't have any kids of their own and-and this door was like a child to them.
Well I'm gonna have to put on a new lock, they'll find out anyway.
Oh no.
Whoa! This looks like an all day job, I'll have to cancel my yoga class. Hey Ross!
Hi.
Could you tell Jasmine that I won't make it to yoga class today?
Sure.
Namaste.
Namaste.
Oh my God! What happened to the door?!
So it's noticeable huh?
Look, is Rachel here? I really need to talk to her.
Didn't you two already talk?
Yeah but uh... Okay, okay look you guys know that Rachel and I slept together, but there's something else. Rachel's pregnant.
Oh my God!!! I can't believe that!!
Holy mother of God!!!
With my child.
That is brand new information!!
You already know don't you?
A little bit.
How are you doing?
Okay. Okay. I mean I'll be okay. It's just I don't think I handled it very well.
Well, what did you say to her?
Nothing. But the complaint department at the condom company got an earful. And then when I turned around she was gone.
Oh Ross.
But hey, in my defense I-I just found out condoms are like only 97% effective.
What?
I gotta go find her.
Whoa! Hey! Whoa!! Hold up! Are you serious?! So like 3% of the time they don't even work?! Huh? They should put that on the box!
Evidently they do.
What?!
I can't believe we're here.
Oh you've got to be kidding me.
What?
As a wedding gift to you, the hotel would like to give you the honeymoon suite.
No!! You have been screwing us all day!
Who are you?
We're you just ten seconds later!
Yeah! You already got the first class tickets; you got the lounge! I mean we should get free stuff too! I mean you're not the only ones on your honeymoon!
Well you can have the suite if you want. We don't care about where we stay. We're here to celebrate our love together. We don't have to get free stuff. We just want to be together.
We need the stuff.
Hey Monica it's Joey. Listen uh, Phoebe and I smell gas comin' from your apartment.
What? Are you serious?! Joey smells gas!
What else is new?
Yeah and we'd go check it out, but you took away our keys.
Well do something! Get in there!
How? I guess I could break down your door.
Yeah! Do that!
And-and you won't blame us for any damage?
No! Are you doing it?! I don't hear anything! Come on!
Uh, okay I'll-I'll-I'll break it down.
Oh hey hi, he's doing it. He's breaking down the door. Okay, we're in.
Okay Rachel, are you comfortable?
If I said I was, would you judge me?
The doctor will be here in a minute to do your sonogram.
Okay. Oh man, I swear if they sold these at Pottery Barn...
Hi!
Hi!
Uh we-we need to talk.
Uh-uh-uh, right now? Because I've kinda got an el fresco situation going on over here.
Please, please I want to apologize for the way I acted earlier today.
Okay Ross that's fine, but can you please stand near my head?
What? Oh yeah. I'm sorry. I mean I-I think I went a little crazy. I mean I was thinking about myself when I really-I should have been thinking about you Rach...
Okay. Head Ross! Head Ross! Head Ross!
Right! Right! I just-I want you to know that I'm going to be there through this whole thing, okay? Okay? The doctor's appointments, the uh, the Lamaze classes, uh baby-proofing the apartment-Although we could probably worry about that 'til after we get married.
What married?
Well yeah, I think we should get married.
What, because that's your answer to everything?
No, because that's the right thing to do.
Yeah, maybe if you're in love. But Ross, we are not in love, are we?
No but...but still you can't possibly do this alone.
Excuse me?
Come on Rach, you can't even eat alone in a restaurant.
What?!
I'm just saying if you can't eat by yourself, how do you expect to have a baby by yourself?
I can too eat by myself!
When have you ever?
When certain people leave the table and I am not finished!
Well certain other people take two hours to eat a bowl of soup!
Oh please, you inhale your food!
I grew up with Monica! If you didn't eat fast you didn't eat!!
Am I interrupting?
Oh no Dr. Long, please come in. This is Ross, he is the father.
But not the husband, because evidently she can do this alone.
Huh. Nice to meet you. I'll get started on this.
I don't know why you can't admit that you need me.
I do need you! I need you to stand near my head!
Okay, everything looks good. Here it is on the screen. Here is your uterus. And right here is your baby.
Oh my God.
Wow. There it is, I see it.
Congratulations. I'll give you two a minute.
Okay.
Thank you.
Pretty amazing huh?
I don't see it!
What? What?!
I can't see it!
You-you just said that you did!
I know, I lied! I didn't want her to think I was a terrible mother! I can't even see my own baby!
Oh sure, come here! Sure you can! Uh, look come here look, it's-it's-it's, it's right there .
Oh. Oh, it's beautiful. I see it now.
Do you really?
No, I don't see it!
Come on! Come on! Here, okay-okay, you see this? This tiny thing that looks like a peanut?
Yeah.
Sweetie that's it.
That's it? Well I saw that! Ohh-ohh-oh, thank you.
You're welcome.
Wow! I can't believe that's our baby.
Yeah, that's our baby.
Hi.
Hey!
Hey! So how was the doctor?
Oh, everything went great.
Good.
Oh hey, show them the picture of your uterus.
Oh.
I don't see the baby. Where is it?
Oh no, I know I couldn't see it either at first, but it's right umm... Ross, I lost it again.
Oh. (He takes the picture and hugs her.
Wait. Before we go in, I just want you to know I love you. I had a great time on our honeymoon, and I can't wait to go in there and spend the rest of our life together.
You're really sticking with the shell necklace huh?
Hi!
Hey! You're back!
Hi sweetie!
Come on in!
So how was the honeymoon?
Oh, so much fun. But the best part is, we met this incredible couple on the way back.
That was the best part? Good honeymooning tiger.
No, they were really cool. They were on their honeymoon too!
They're terrific, and they live right here in the city.
Yeah, can we go call them? Is it too soon to call? I wanna call.
I'm sorry, we're just kinda excited because we finally have a couple to hang out with.
I know.
A couple? Like two people? Like one , two people?
This is different! Greg and Jenny are in a relationship.
Oh, Greg and Jenny yuck! Hi Greg, I'm Chandler this is Monica. Hi Monica, this is Jenny. Hi Jenny. Hi Greg.
Listen, they are really great. If you just got a chance...
Y'know what? Why don't you just give us our souvenirs and get the hell out of here?
We really...didn't get a chance to...
You have got to be kidding me!
We didn't get anything for anyone.
Hm-mm! Yeah nice necklace!
That you can have.
Hi!
Hey!
Hello!
Welcome home.
So, how was the honeymoon?
It was great! It was great! How about you?! I mean you're having a baby!
Oh! Look! I have a sonogram picture!
Oh great!
Ross! It's got your wavy black lines!
All right, so now that Ross knows can you tell us y'know how it happened? I mean, when did it happen? How many times did it happen?
Monica! That's not right! Start with where.
Well it happened about six weeks ago, and uh I had just got home from work and Ross was already there 'cause I guess he had been hanging out with Joey.
You're welcome buddy.
Yeah, thanks.
And so I had a lot of work to do so Ross, nice guy that he is, offered to help me out. And then we had a little wine, we got to talking, and the next thing you know out of nowhere Ross comes on to me.
Umm that's...that's a little misleading.
What is?
The lie you just told.
That-that you came on to me?
There's the one!
But you did! I mean, let's be honest.
Yes let's. Y'know what? Uh, it's-it's not important. What is important is that, is that we're having a baby. And it's not-Doesn't matter who came on to who.
Whom. That's right.
You know you kissed me first.
What? What?! You were begging me to kiss you! You-you-you were sending me signals all over the place!
I was sending you signals?
Yeah!
Oh please. Okay, anyone in this room think that I would send Ross begging symbols, please show of hands.
Y'know what?! It doesn't matter! It doesn't matter what you believe! What matters is what happened!
Okay. So these signals Ross, explain this to me, 'cause maybe I need to be more careful. I mean, am I sending you these signals right now?
Y'know what? Y'know what? Rachel, just-just drop it.
No please, show me how I begged you!
I can show you, I have it on videotape! It's an expression.
I can't believe he taped the two of them having sex!
Yeah! You gotta tell a girl before you tape her. Such a rookie mistake.
Y'know who has a great video camera?
Greg and Jenny?
Do you still wanna call 'em? I wanna call 'em.
Let's call 'em.
Yeah! Ask them if they brought their friends any souvenirs!
Hello? Eighth street deli?
Hey, hang up! You get food poisoning just talkin' to that place.
Uh sorry, wrong number.
Here you go.
Hello? It's the deli again!
All right! I'll have a sandwich!
I don't think this number's right!
What?
You got fake numbered.
What?! People don't do that!
Oh I think we do.
They gave us a fake number? Why? Why would they do that?
I don't know! You were a delight to talk to. You asked all those insightful, great questions.
And you've never been funnier. Joke, joke, joke, you were a hoot!
Y'know what? Don't worry about it, you still got me and Phoebe.
Excuse me, I don't want Greg and Jenny's rejects.
Rachel won't talk to me! She won't even open the door!
Hmm, I wonder why. Pervert!
Okay, listen I am not a pervert!
That's like the pervert motto! Yeah! Yeah! They have you raise your right hand, put your left hand down your pants, and repeat that!
Filming Rachel is not something I planned. Okay look, here's what happened, and Joey you-you can back me up on this. All right, about-about a month and a half ago I came to you with a problem? Umm, a personal thing.
Personal thing? What personal thing? I don't know.
About...about sex? That I hadn't had sex in months?
Yeah I knew what you were talkin' about.
Hey!
Hey.
Do you have a minute? I'd like to talk to you about something I'm, I'm really uncomfortable talking about.
Sure. What? About uh, you showering with your mom?
I actually had a topic in mind! I'm, I'm kinda going through a dry spell, sex wise.
Whoa, for like months?
Five to be lying, six.
Six months? Whoa that's rough.
Well, I mean it's not all bad. I'm learning to appreciate the uh, smaller things in life. Like the sound of a bird and the color of the sky.
The sky's blue Ross and I had sex yesterday!
Please, help me! I have a date tonight. It has to go well okay-I'm scared for my health!
Okay. Okay. Umm...Ooh! Oh-oh, I got something. It's this story I came up with, very romantic. I swear any woman that hears it; they're like putty.
Really? Well then tell it to me.
Okay. Now you're gonna want to have sex with me when you hear it, but you have to remember it is just the story.
I'll try to control myself.
Okay. Years ago, when I was backpacking across Western Europe...
You were backpacking across Western Europe?
Have a nice six more months Ross!
Okay! Okay! Okay. I'm sorry. Please, please, you were in Western Europe and?
I was just outside Barcelona hiking in the foothills of Mount Tibidabo. I was at the end of this path and I came to a clearing and there was a lake, very secluded. And there were tall trees all around. It was dead silent. Gorgeous. And across the lake I saw...a beautiful woman...bathing herself...but she was crying...
Why?
Umm, this is great wine.
It's from France...In Europe...Western Europe. Y'know umm, a few years ago I actually was backpacking across Western Europe.
Really?
Uh-hmm-Wait! It gets better. Um, yeah I was in Barcelona.
I studied for a year in Barcelona.
Anyway, umm so I was um, I was hiking...
I love hiking!
Oh that's great! I was hiking along the foothills of Mount Tibidaybo...
I think its Tibidabo.
Okay! Do you wanna tell the story?!
Whoa! What are you doing here? How did your date go?
Great! I'm across the street having sex with her right now. Your story sucks!
Hey! Look, if it didn't work it's because you didn't tell it right! Show me how you did it.
No! No, I don't...don't want to.
How long since you've seen a girl naked?
I was backpacking across Western Europe.
I'm not feeling it.
I was just outside Barcelona, hiking...
No! No! No Ross! I'm not hot! Are you hot?
It's been six months! I'm always hot!
Well you're not selling the story! It's like; it's like you don't believe it! Look, I gotta go. I got a date, but try this. Do what I do when I'm preparing for an audition. Okay? I'll set you up with my video camera and you can record yourself and-and see what you're doing wrong.
I'll try that.
All right now... All right, you're all set up. You're good to go. Just hit record. All right?
Thanks.
Good luck.
Thanks. And-and hey Joe?
Yeah?
Listen, if you ever have any problem with the ladies you know I'll help you out.
That means a lot to me man.
Hello! Can I get you anything? Huh? Lens cleaner? Your battery okay? Rachel!
Oh Ross!
Hi!
Thank God you're here! You have to help me! Were you just talking to yourself?
That's less embarrassing, yes. Yes I was.
So when she came in, I got distracted and totally forgot about the camera. It kept rolling and recorded everything.
Yeah, we're gonna need to see that tape.
Yeah, definitely.
What a great idea! That will get Rachel to forgive me!
Y'know what? This is not fair to her. Let's just forget the tape!
Thank you. No!
You're right.
Joey! No!
Loud and clear!
I still don't get why Greg and Jenny would give us a fake number.
Y'know, if they knew what they were doing they probably didn't give you real names either.
Okay, maybe people give out fake numbers, but they don't give out fake names.
Oh yeah? Hi, Ken Adams, nice to meet you.
Regina Philange.
I still don't get it, we didn't do anything wrong.
I know! Although, you did tell an awful lot of jokes.
I thought you said those jokes were funny. Joke! Joke! Joke!
Joke. Joke. Blah! Blah!
Well maybe it was all of your questions.
What about my questions?
The sheer volume, it was like flying with the Riddler!
Oh, I'm sorry. Was that another joke?
Was that another question?
Hey! Is Ross still here?
Uh no Rach, he's gone. But listen, he told us what happened and it does, it sounds like an honest mistake.
Oh really? Well how would you like it if I had sex with you and I taped it? Oh forget it! Oh there he is now, the father of my child, the porn king of the west village.
Look, it was accident! Okay? I-I feel bad that it happened, but I swear, I didn't even watch it! Anyway, here. I thought you might be more comfortable destroying it yourself.
Thank you. What? You don't want to see this do you?
Hell yeah!!!
I am not gonna show you this!
No! Not the sex part, just the stuff leading up to it.
Forget it, she's destroying it.
Okay fine! Fine! We'll just have to think of some other way to put the whole 'Who came onto who,' thing to rest! Come on now, think!!
Look, forget it Phoebe. Okay? It's Rachel's tape and she can do whatever she wants with it. And she wants to destroy it. So, end of story.
I wanna see it.
What?!
Clearly you don't want people to see this tape. Now I don't want people to see this tape either, but you so badly don't people to see it makes me want to see it. You see?
Are we watchin' the tape or not?!
I don't want people to see it for your sake.
Ahh, I don't believe you. I think you don't want them to see you begging me.
Rachel, please...
Ah, a little preview!
Fine. Fine, but I want the record to show that I tried to take the high road, because in about five minutes I'm gonna be saying...
Okay, here we go.
Hello! Can I get you anything?
I'm so happy!
Oh, thank God you're here! You have to help me! Were you just talking to yourself?
There I am.
You're gonna get pregnant.
I screwed up so bad, I told Monica that I would stuff and send all these wedding invitations like weeks ago and I-I...
You didn't do it?
I-I know-I had put them in...in-in my desk at work and I completely forgot about them until today.
Sweetie okay. It's okay. Everybody made it to the wedding. I'm fine.
Kinda hurtin' my hand though.
I know.
I cannot believe that I did this. Especially after Monica just went on and on and on about it! "Okay Rachel! Here are the invitations Rachel! Now be very careful Rachel! Please, drinking no liquids around the invitations Rachel!" Whoa oh! Oh-oh-oh! Oh...oh-oh-oh...
Did you do it on our invitations?!
Not on the ones we sent out.
So, just the ones gave back to us and we had framed!
Can you believe this is already happening? I mean it seems like yesterday they just got engaged.
I know. Hey remember...remember the night they got engaged? How uh, you and I almost...
Oh, I remember how we almost. Do you think we would've gone through with it? Y'know, if we hadn't gotten caught. Do you think we would've done it?
I mean I...I know I wanted to. I just, I just wasn't sure if you wanted to.
Oh I wanted to.
So we...we both wanted to.
Interesting.
Yeah. Anyway umm, it probably worked out for the best.
Oh yeah, sure.
Okay, in about ten seconds you're gonna see him kiss me.
And in about five seconds you're gonna see why.
Ross did I ever tell you about the time that I went backpacking through Western Europe?
Okay, get ready to see some beggin'!
Oh, you came on to Ross!
What?!
Now I'm so happy.
What are you talking about?!
You used the Europe story!
That's the magic story you use when you wanna have sex!
How do you know about that story?!
How do you know about that story?!
I heard it from my friend Irene who heard it from some guy!
Some guy!!
No. No, she told me his name was Ken Adams.
Ken Adams!!
Hi.
So uh, apparently people are familiar with the Europe story?
Yeah. Listen about that, the whole uh, who came on to who thing really doesn't matter. I mean, I think it would've happened either way. I mean if you hadn't initiated it I-I-I know I would've.
It was an amazing night.
It was. It was an amazing night.
You think it looked amazing?
I uh... I don't know. I mean I...I honestly didn't watch it.
Yeah, me neither. Yet...
Uhhhhhh...that-that may be weird.
Yeah, it would be really weird.
Good luck.
Good luck to you.
Mind if I mute?
Oh please.
Oh, oh there go the clothes.
You are undressing very quickly.
Six months Rachel, six months.
Ah. Oh.
Hey. We-we look...we look pretty good.
That's what I was gonna say.
Oh nice tan!
Thank you! I had just gone to the beach that weekend.
Ah....
Have you been working out?
I have been working out.
Really? Wow, this is so much better than I...
Ohh! Ew!
Oh that's not pretty.
Oh! Oh!
No!
Oh God!
Oh no!
Oh, make it stop!
Oh no!!
Make it stop!!
No!!
Have to make it stop!!
No!!!
Hello Greg? Hi, this is Monica from the plane? Listen, the number that you gave me 853-5... That is their old number! Jenny's been giving it out since they moved!
Jenny! That is so Jenny!
Hey listen umm, how would you like to get together? Say next Saturday? Okay, how about Sunday? Okay umm, the week after that? The week after that? Y'know what Greg? Y'know what? We are good, interesting, funny people with good questions and if you and your precious Jenny can't see that then... January 15th? We'll see you then! Okay!
Okay, now this one is rare, this one is medium well! Now go-go-go! Hey Phoebe!
Hey!
Hey how was dinner?!
Dinner was good!
Okay!
I'm just saying hi! Now I'm gonna go!
Okay!
Oh, well hello there.
Hi.
I didn't see this on the menu.
Uh Tim? This is Phoebe. Phoebe this is Tim, my new sous chef.
Oh, so you're Monica's boss?
Actually she's my-my boss. Sous is French for under.
Oh! I sous stand.
Hey Tim? I need a calamari and a Caesar salad. And umm, could you get me the pesto?
Yeah.
Oh you...you made pesto?
Yes I did.
Would you say your pesto is the best-o?
I...I-I don't know, but I would say it's pretty good-o.
All right, I still need a calamari and a Caesar salad.
I like your necklace.
I made it myself.
You are so talented.
Well, it's no pesto.
All right, all right! Let's just cut to the chase, okay? You're single. You're single. He gets off work at eleven. She'll be waiting for your call. I'll give him your number if I can get one calamari and one Caesar salad!! I did not yell. I am not putting a dollar in the jar.
Wow Bing! Burning the midnight oil.
You know me sir. Oh ah, I do have a question for ya. Do you know how I get around the office computer network so I can access the really good Internet porn?
You're a joker Bing.
What's funny about that?
Hey! Sorry I kept you waiting so long.
Hey that's okay. So, where do you want to go?
Oh ah, I think you know where I want to go.
The Hard Rock Caf?
Yeah!
Again?!
Yeah!!
I'm telling you, I like the food!
You like the Purple Rain display! Hey Bob.
Hey Toby! Have a good night.
Did that guy just call you Toby?
Yeah, he thinks that's my name.
Well, why don't you correct him?
Oh it's been going on way to long now. Y'know, I mean the first time he said it we were just passing each other in the hallway, so I didn't say anything. And then the next time he said, "Hey Toby, do you want a donut?" And I-I wanted a donut. And now it's five years later, the donut's gone and I'm still Toby.
Five years?! Chandler you have to tell him!
No! That would be so awkward! Look-Besides, we work in different departments. He's on the sixth floor y'know? So he calls me Toby once in a while. What's the big deal? It could be worse, it's not like he's calling me Muriel.
Muriel. Wh-why would he call you Muriel? Oh my God! Chandler M Bing? It's not just an M, your middle name is Muriel!!
Shh! It is a family name!
Chandler Muriel Bing. Boy, your parents never gave you a chance did they?
Drake, I've discovered the reason for all your headaches and memory loss.
What is it?
Apparently your brain transplant was not entirely successful. It seems your body is rejecting Jessica's brain.
Is it serious?
Not if we extract tissue from the original host body, synthesize antibodies, and introduce them into your system, which could stop it from rejecting the brain.
Well that sounds simple enough, let's just do that.
We would, but when we went to exhume Jessica's body, it was gone.
Cut! Very nice people!
Okay, let me just get changed and we can go to dinner.
Well don't-What happened to Jessica's body?!
I'm not telling, you'll have to see it on TV!
You don't know do you?
No, couldn't care less.
Hey good scene man.
Hey you too!
Alright.
What? You weren't in it.
Oh!
Oh sorry. Uh-uh, Kash?
Yes?
This is my friend Rachel. Rachel, Kash, Kash, Rachel.
Hi.
Hey! How come I haven't seen you here before?
Well, Joey probably thinks I'll just embarrass him. Y'know, he thinks I'm some kind of a soap opera nut-Which I'm not! I'm not. Although I do know that your uh, your favorite ice cream flavor is butter pecan. And uh, and that your-your dog's name is Wally. Well look at that, I'm just stroking your arm.
Here we go! Here we go!
Oh, we're leaving. Bye Kash.
Bye.
Say hi to Wally.
Ooh Monica!
Hi!
Oh my God! I had the best time with Tim last night. He is so sweet! Oh, I can't wait to get sous-neath him.
I...I have to fire him.
But why?!
Because he's terrible! Okay, he's slow, he burns things, last night he lit my pastry chef on fire!
Well maybe he was just nervous, y'know you can be very intimidating. And besides I've met your pastry chef and she can stand to be taken down a peg or two.
Well, now she has no eyebrows, mission accomplished.
But Monica, he loves his job so much! Can you just give him another chance? Please?
All right, but if-if he lights someone else on fire he is out of there!
That's fair! Thank you so much. Thanks. Oops, it looks like when he got the pastry chef he got you a little bit too.
I paid to have this done.
Love it!
Hey!
Hi!
Oh you know uh Kash, really liked you the other day. He said he thought you were charming.
I thought I was a complete idiot.
Hey, I'm with you. He even asked me if I thought you'd go out with him.
Oh! Oh, I think I'm gonna throw up a little bit. What did you say?
I said no.
What?!
What? I...I just figured since you're pregnant you're not gonna be seeing people.
Okay Joey, first of all Kash Ford is not people. Second of all, what did he say when you told him I was pregnant?
I didn't tell him. I didn't know if you were telling people. This is back when I thought Kash was still people.
Good-good, don't tell him. Don't tell him. Just have him call me okay?
Rach look, I really don't think that's such a great...
Okay, you go do it! I'll come back to that set! I'll meet more actors! I'll meet 'em all!
Hey Bob.
Hey! How's my pal Toby doing today?
If I see him, I'll ask.
Toby!
Hey-hey! Bing? Was that Bob from six you were just talking too?
Yeah!
Oh then you know each other.
We're on a semi-first name basis.
What do you think of adding him to our team?
Bob? Ooh, working here with us? Everyday? Yeah, I don't know if he has what it takes.
Really? They love him down on six.
But this is eleven. It's almost twice as hard up here.
Okay, I hear you loud and clear. Bob will stay put.
I think it's best sir.
But we really do need to find someone up here. The work is starting to pile up. I've got a stack of documents on my desk this high.
Y'know what you should do, just toss 'em in the shedder and claim you never got 'em.
That's a good one.
What does a guy have to do to be taken seriously around here?!
Hey!
Hey. Okay, I gave him another chance, but Tim has got to go!
But...
No! No-no! He is totally incompetent. I called the chef who recommended him to me. He said, "Ha-ha! Gotcha!"
Okay. Okay, but you can't fire him today.
Why not?!
Because I'm dumping him today.
What?! You said he was sweet!
He is sweet. He's too sweet. He calls me all the time. "So did-did you get home from work okay?" "Did-did you get out of the shower okay?"
Just don't pick up your phone.
Then he comes over! "I'm so worried about you." Uck! Be a man!
What? So now I'm not allowed to fire him?
You can't fire him and dump him the same day, he'll kill himself.
Okay well then, I'll fire him today and you go out with him for another week.
Are you kidding?! Another week with that sip, I'll kill myself!
Okay well, then we'll both do it today and he'll just have to deal with it!
Okay. But the question is who's gonna go first. 'Cause whoever goes second is the bitch.
What do you mean?
Come on! The boss that fires a guy that's just been dumped, bitch! And the woman who dumps a guy that's just been fired, blond bitch!
I wanted to do this days ago so I think I should go first.
All right, that makes sense. Ugh. But-Screw you I'm going first!
Hey Toby, you got a sec?
Sure, what's up?
I just had a meeting, I was actually hoping to get transferred up here, but I just found out its not gonna happen. Apparently somebody thinks I'm not eleventh floor material. Say uh, who the hell is this Chandler?
Hey, what do you think is a better excuse for why I'm not drinking on this date tonight. "Umm, I'm a recovering alcoholic. I'm a Mormon," or "I got so hammered last night I'm still a little drunk?"
Hey!
Hi!
Hey!
So, what do you want to do tonight? There's a Ukrainian film at the Angelica that's supposed to be very powerful. Interested?
No. No. But I'll go see a normal person movie with ya.
Rach? You wanna come?
Oh no, I can't. I got a date.
A date?
Yeah. Why? Is that weird for you?
Why no, it's the opposite of weird. It's-it's uh, regular. It's-it's uh, it's mundane. It's actually uh, a little dull.
It's no Ukrainian film.
Yeah-Ooh! Earrings!
A date?! She's-she's got a date?! With who?
I set her up with this actor on my show.
You set her up?!
No
Joey what-what were you thinking?!
Well, I was thinking that it'd probably be okay because Ross hasn't gone out with Rachel in five years!
Joey, I'm not worried about her! I'm worried about my baby! Whoever she dates my baby dates! Now-now where is this actor taking them?
Hey! I'm an actor too! I'm not sure. I think they're taking the ferry out to some Italian place on Staten Island.
A ferry? My baby is going on a ferry? Do you have any idea how dangerous those are?!
Are we talking about one of those big boats that carry cars that go like five miles an hour?
Why don't they just jump out of an airplane?! Huh?! That-that's a fun date! Or burn each other with matches?! That's fun too! Whew!!
Hey Joey.
Hey Kash. Uh hey-hey this is Ross. Ross, this is Kash.
Hey.
Hi. I-I hear you're going on a ferry tonight.
Yeah.
A bit of a daredevil are we?
Hey guys do you think this is too slutty-Hi Kash!
Hey Rachel! You ready to go?
Yeah! All right, I'll see you guys later.
Okay. Have a great time you guys.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Yes it is too slutty!
Hi!
Hi.
Oh, I'm so glad you called. I feel like it's always me calling you. So, what's up? Is everything okay with Phoebe?
It will be...in a minute. Listen, Tim you're a really great guy.
It's because I'm with you.
Aw. I'm just-I'm in a place in my life right now where I...I...
Whoops. Sorry. This just in. Oh, it's 9-1-1 from the restaurant, that means Monica needs me right away.
Oh-oh no she doesn't! I know what that is. You can stay.
Awww, I'll miss you too Pheebs. And I will be holding you, right here.
So what movie do you want to see-And not another one I have to read. Okay? I get enough of that from books.
Books?
All right, car magazines, cereal boxes, but it's like enough!
Well, I tell you what. Why don't we uh, why don't we just stay here? Let's not see a movie, we'll just hang.
And just wait for Rachel to come back from her date?
Hey, if that's what you want to do I'm not gonna say no.
Dude! What is going on?!
I just...I have to find out how it went.
Why?
This guy could be my baby's stepfather!
They go on one date and you're worried about them getting married?! He's not you!
I just-I-I can't believe she's-she's dating?!
Well Ross, what did you think she was gonna do?
I don't know! I guess I just can't believe any of this is happening.
What do you mean?
It's just I always thought when I had another kid it would be different. Now I-I love Ben, but every time I have to drop him off at Carol and Susan's, it's like-It breaks my heart a little. I mean I've always had this picture of me and my next wife in bed on Sunday and, my kid comes running in and leaps up onto the bed. And we all read the paper together. Y'know? Maybe fight over the science section.
That's a nice picture. Maybe you can still have that!
No! No I can't. I mean Rachel's out with some guy. My baby went with her. If anything that picture keeps moving further away.
Hey, can I ask you something? In this, in this picture of you and your wife, is your wife Rachel?
It used to be. Now she doesn't really have a face. Smokin' body though.
Good call. Yeah. But, the face Ross, the face isn't Rachel.
No but ahh! How much easier would it be if it were?
I know, but I don't think that's what she wants.
No, it's not what I want either. I mean I-I can't force myself to fall in love with her again now.
That's okay Ross maybe you need a new picture. Okay? It's not gonna be what you thought, but no matter what there's gonna be a brand new little baby, your baby. Who cares what the picture looks like?
Yeah.
Hey, I tell you what. Let's you and me go out and have some fun. Huh? Whatever you want. Come on!
We can still catch that Ukrainian film.
No, I said fun!
Hey Toby!
Hey Bobby.
It's Bob actually. Hey, you work up here, can you tell me where this Chandler Bing's office is?
Uhh yeah. Yeah, it's right, right down there. Right there, yeah. Can I ask you why?
I want to talk to that bastard, see what his problem is.
Okay Bob listen uhh, I'm the reason you didn't get the job up here.
Toby don't.
Bob!
Toby! I'm not gonna let you cover for him. Anything you say right now will just get me more upset with Chandler!
Well that puts me in a difficult position.
Hey.
I got your page, is everything okay?
Uh well that depends, how are things with Phoebe?
Oh it's great! It's great! Thank you so much for introducing us!
Oh my pleasure. Okay, I'm afraid I've got some bad news. Phoebe!
Monica!
You're fired!
I'm breaking up with you!
What?
I'm, I'm breaking up with you.
You're fired.
Why?
I'm sorry, I'm just-I'm...I'm just not ready for a relationship right now.
Yeah and-and I'm sorry too. But, well I just-I like things done a certain way and the chemistry's just not right.
Oh that's good, the chemistry thing for us too.
Wow! Umm, okay. Umm... I-I-I realize I came on a little strong but, it's only because I think you're so amazing. And uh, I-I just wanna, I just wanna tell you how much I appreciate you giving me an opportunity here because I-you're the most talented chef I've ever worked for. Anyway...
Tim wait!
Yeah?
Umm, I think I spoke too quickly. There-there's a learning curve with this job and maybe we can try it again.
Really?
Yeah.
Thank you so much! 'Cause I-I know I can do better!
Okay.
And Tim I just wanna say, good luck here.
Hello.
Hi!
Well, how was the date?
Well I'm alone and I just bought fifteen dollars worth of candy bars, what do you think?
Uh-huh. What happened?
I made the mistake of telling him that I was pregnant.
Ah, he didn't uh, take it so well?
Well better than you, but y'know still not what you want.
Oh?
He got all weird and sputtery and then he said uh, "Yeah, I hear those hemorrhoids are a bitch."
He sounds swell.
Doesn't he?
Hey, wanna...wanna a little cheering up?
Yes.
Sit down.
Okay.
Guess whose middle name is Muriel.
Chandler M. Bing?
Yeah-ha!
Oh my God.
I'm sorry about your date.
Oh it's all right. I'm guess I'm just done with the whole dating thing. It's one more thing in my life that's suddenly completely different. This is hard.
Yeah I know. On the other hand in um, in about seven months you're gonna have something that you're gonna love more than any guy you've ever gone out with. Just wait. Wait until uh, wait until the first time your baby grabs your finger. You have no idea.
Thanks sweetie.
You wanna, you wanna grab some coffee?
Oh no, I think I'm gonna go home and eat ten candy bars.
Hey, I thought I cheered you up.
Oh you did, there are twenty in here.
Right. Good night.
Good night.
Ross?
Yeah?
Hey it's Mona! From the wedding.
Oh hi!
Hi!
Wow! Uh...how are you?
I'm good except umm, you still owe me a dance.
Oh that's right. Well uh, would you be interested in seeing a Ukrainian film?
Oh you're serious. Sure!
Great! Well umm...
I think I might need one more cup of coffee.
Sure! Uh, let me get it for ya.
Okay.
Bob. Bob! Bob!!! What the hell are you doing?!
I just found out this is Chandler's office! Come on Toby, give me a hand!
Hey you guys?
What?
I know it's last minute, but we decided to have a Halloween party.
Oh good!
And everybody has to wear costumes. Come on! It'll be fun!
Well, I'll-I'll be there. I mean I have to wear a costume to all my classes that day anyway so...
Please tell me you're not gonna dress up like a dinosaur.
Not two years in a row.
Look, I'll come to the party but I'm not dressing up.
You have to!
No way! Look, Halloween is so stupid! Dressing up, pretending to be someone you're not...
You're an actor!
So Ross, are you gonna bring Mona?
Yeah. Yeah, I think I will.
That hot girl from their wedding?
Yeah.
Well hey-hey if she needs any idea for costumes, she could be a bikini model, or a slutty nurse, or a sexy cheerleader huh-Ooh-ooh, Leatherface from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre-No-no-no! Slutty Leatherface.
Now wasn't Joey hitting on her at the wedding too?
That's right! He was hitting on her, and I got her. I guess the better man won. Please don't take her from me.
Ursula! Wait! Err-err, it's me! Phoebe!
Oh, I thought there was a mirror there. Okay, bye-bye.
Wait a second! So, what's new with you?
Umm, nothing. I mean, I'm getting married next week.
What?!
Yeah! Yeah, it's gonna be a small ceremony. Just family. His.
Huh. Okay. Well, I'm really happy for you.
Wait! If umm, if you want to come, I guess that'd be okay.
Really?
Sure! Why not? You could be my sister for the day.
Yeah. Okay. Umm, y'know, my friends are having a Halloween party tonight at my old apartment so, you could come. Maybe I could meet the guy you're marrying.
Huh. Well, I'm supposed to be working at the restaurant tonight. I'm supposed to be working right now, so who cares.
By the way, it's a costume party.
Oh! Okay, so that's why you're...
No. But thanks.
Hi!
Wait! You're supposed to wear a costume!
I am! I am a woman who spent a lot of money on a dress and she wants to wear it, because soon she won't be able to fit into it.
Oh.
Ahh!
I'm Catwoman, who wants to borrow the dress when you're too big for it.
Okay.
Trick or treat!
Oh! Oh! Can I give out the candy? I really want to be with the kids right now. Y'know, ever since I got pregnant I-I have the strongest maternal instincts.
Trick or treat!!
Just a minute!!! Look at you guys! Wow! You are a very scary witch.
Thank you.
And you are a very funny clown.
Thank you.
And you are so in style right now. Y'know, I work at Ralph Lauren and the whole fall line has got this like equestrian theme going on. I don't suppose you saw the cover of British Vogue, but...
Can I just have the candy?
Yeah. Sure.
Ah, Catwoman. So we meet again.
So we do Supergirl.
No, it's me. Phoebe!
Monica! Can I talk to you for a second? Listen, I appreciate you getting me the costume...
Oh, you did this to him?
What?! I thought he'd love it! His favorite kid's book was the Velveteen Rabbit!
The Velveteen Rabbit was brown and white!
Well, it was either a pink bunny or no bunny at all.
No bunny at all!! Always no bunny at all!!!
Hey!
You didn't dress up either?!
Yes I did! I'm Chandler. Dude, what happened?
How is that me?
Okay. I'm Chandler
That is so you!
When have I ever done that?!
When have I ever done that?!
Trick or treat!
Oh! Well you're just the prettiest ballerina I've ever seen.
Thank you.
Oh wow! That deserves another piece of candy.
Thank you.
Well, I have to say that earns tutu pieces of candy.
I love you!
Ohh... Oh, honey here. Take it all. Monica! We need more candy?
What?! There's only been like four kids.
Yeah I know, but one of them just said that she loved me so I just gave her everything.
No wonder your pregnant.
Hey!
Hey.
What are you supposed to be?
Remember the Russian satellite, Sputnik? Well, I'm a potato or a...spud. And these are my antennae. So Sputnik, becomes... Spud-nik. Spudnik!
Wow! I don't have the worst costume anymore!
Hey all right, Ross came as doody.
No, I-I'm not doody.
No, space doody!
Aren't you gonna give me a kiss?
Okay, I will. But right after you tell me who the hell you are.
Ursula?
Ursula's fiance?
Oh my God, you're the sister!
Yeah.
Okay, I just slapped my future sister-in-law's ass.
Yeah.
I'm an idiot. Uh, is your mother here? Maybe I can give her a little slap on the butt.
My mother killed herself.
She, now I knew that and...now I'm sweating. Look at me, I'm really sweating-Now I'm saying, "Look at me," I'm getting even sweatier. I think I probably should go.
No-no! That's okay, we'll just start over. Okay? Hi! I'm Phoebe.
Eric.
Why are you looking at me like that?
'Cause the sweat's getting in my eyes and its burning.
Okay. So, what are you?
I don't think they have a name for it. It's just I get nervous; I start sweating like crazy.
No I-I meant your costume.
Oh umm, I'm the solar system. Yeah, my students helped me make it-I teach the second grade.
I love the second grade!
Really?
Yeah! It's so much better than first grade when you don't know what's going on and definitely better than third grade. Y'know with all the politics and mind games.
So what do you do?
Umm, I'm a masseuse...by day.
Y'know you don't have to stand here with me, believe me...
No I'm having fun. I'm really-And I'm really-really excited for you and Ursula.
Oh I feel very lucky, she's great. I think she's the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.
Thank you.
Hey Joey?
Yeah.
You read comic books right?
Exclusively.
Who do you think would win in a fight, Catwoman or Supergirl?
Catwoman, hands down.
Yeah...
But between you and Phoebe, I'd have to give the edge to Phoebe.
What?! Really?!
Are you kiddin'? Phoebe lived on the street. Okay? Plus, she's got this crazy temper. She-She's not standing right behind me is she?
No you're fine. All right well, do you think I could take Rachel?
I'm not sure.
What?! Come on I am tough! Punch me right here! As hard as you can!
Will you relax?! What are you taking this so seriously for? It doesn't matter.
Oh really? Okay? Well what would you say if I told you that, y'know, Ross or Chandler could beat you up?
I would say, "Woman, please!"
Hey. Ursula's fiance is really sweet! He's a teacher, he does all this volunteer work. Y'know normally y'know, I don't like really sweaty guys. But this one? I could just mop him up!
Oh my God, Phoebe!
What?
You're getting a crush on your sister's fiance.
No I'm not! You are!
Here comes the temper.
Trick or treat!
Hi! Y'know what honey, we're actually out of candy right now. But someone just went out to get some and I have been giving out money but I'm out of that too. Hey, can I write you a check?
Okay!
Okay, what's your name?
Lelani Mayolanofavich.
Okay, I'm just gonna write this out to cash.
Hi!
Hey Mona!
Oh! Hi!
Hi!
Joey's gonna be thrilled! He was hoping you'd come by as a slutty nurse.
Umm, actually I'm just a nurse.
You'd think that would embarrass me, but you see I'm maxed out.
Hey!
Hi!
You made it!
Wait-wait! You're umm, you're a potato...
Well, I'm a spud...
And the antennae...Oh my God you're Spudnik!
Yes!
Marry her.
Okay, here's a good one for ya. Who do think would win in a fight between Ross and Chandler.
I can't answer that! Chandler's my husband.
So Ross?
Yeah.
Hey beautiful.
Hello handsome. Oh God. Oh look at you two. So when did you guys meet?
Two weeks ago.
Two weeks? That's it?
Yeah, I know it sounds crazy, and it's not like me to do something so impulsive, but she's just so perfect, and we have so much in common.
Oh really?
We're both teachers.
Huh?
And we were both in the Peace Corps.
Peace Corps, really?
In fact when we were building houses in Uruguay, we were, we were just two towns apart and we never met.
Yeah. It wasn't a town when I got there, but it was a town when I left. Shall we get me really drunk?
Sure.
Howdy doody.
That's funny. Yeah. Y'know you're the funniest man here in a pink bunny costume his wife made him wear.
Oh relax man, relax. You're looking a little flushed.
Hey-hey-hey, I think we might find out the answer to our question.
What question?
Monica and I were talking about who could kick whose ass in a fight, you or Ross?
There's no question.
So you think Ross too?
You picked Ross?!
Ross is really strong! Okay, he's the strongest out of all three of you! Except for Joey.
I cannot believe you didn't pick me.
Uh, in her defense, she's right. I am stronger. I would destroy you.
Oh really?! You think you're stronger? Why don't you prove it?
Oh I'll prove it! I'll prove it like a theorem!!
Wait-wait!! Okay, stop it! Stop it! Stop! Now listen, no one's gonna fight in this apartment.
Hey Monica! People came to see a fight, let's give 'em what they came for!
Hey, you guys could arm wrestle.
Yeah. Listen to the slutty nurse.
You're going down.
Oh yeah? You're going further down! Downtown!
Seriously guys, the trash talk is embarrassing.
Oh Gunther! You brought candy! Thank you so much for picking this up! You are so sweet.
Really?
Honey, someday you are gonna make some man the luckiest guy in the world.
Trick or treat!
Gotta go! Hi! Wow! There you go!
My friend Lewis told me you were giving out money.
Oh yeah, we were but umm, now we've got candy.
I'd rather have the money.
Well, that-that's not your choice. Happy Halloween!
This isn't fair.
Well is it fair that all you did was put on a cape and I gotta give you free stuff?
Shut up!
You shut up!
You can't tell me to shut up!
Uh, I think I just did. And uh-oh, here it comes again. Shut up!
Rach?
Yeah I know-I'm good-I got it! Now wait a minute, I've got one more thing I have to say to you...oh right! Shut up!
You're a mean old woman.
No! Wait no! Shut up-I mean don't cry! Let me get my checkbook!
Look honey, you don't have to do this, okay? It's the strength you have inside that means the most to me. You're loyal, you're honest, and you have integrity! That's the kind of strength that I want in the man that I love!
That means nothing to me. Come on!
Hi liar!
Hey!
Y'know the only reason he's marrying you is because he thinks all the things you were saying about yourself were true.
Well they could be true.
But they're not!
Yeah, it's a fine line huh?
Why are you lying to him?
I don't know. He said he did all this stuff and then I said I did it too and he got so excited, it was really fun.
Honey?
It's a filthy, disgusting habit and I want you to quit now!
She's helped so many people to quit smoking.
Y'know, we'd really better get going.
Oh right, you've got a church group meeting tonight.
Right.
Well, it was nice meeting you.
You too. And Ursula?! It was really nice meeting you tonight!!
Pheebs come on! Bunny vs. Doody! We're waiting! Okay. Okay guys, one match, winner take all. Oh wait-wait! What does the winner get?
Pride.
And dignity.
Okay, if you say so. All right, ready? Set! Go!
Wow! They're both really strong.
Or equally weak.
Oh God!
Hmm?
Chandler's making his sex face.
So, you gettin' tired?
Nope! I can do this all day.
Yeah? Me too. Gettin' a little tired though.
God, I'm exhausted.
Look this is starting to look really bad for me. Okay? Mona, Mona's standing right over there. Oh God, she's talking to Joey! You gotta let me win!
No way! If anything you've gotta let me win! My wife thinks I'm a wimp!
Hey, at least you have a wife! I-I keep getting divorces and knockin' people up! And I'm dressed as doody.
You're Spudnik.
Come on, who are we kidding? I'm doody. Please? She's watchin'.
Fine. Oh no!
Oh yeah!
Yay! My hero!
You're a weird lady.
Hey. Ursula said she left her purse.
Oh.
What a relief. It has all the numbers of the people in her prayer chain.
Sure it does. Yeah, yeah.
Well, I guess I'll see you at the wedding.
Umm listen, I don't think...I don't think I'm gonna make it to the wedding. So I just want to wish you all the luck in the world.
I think we'll be okay. Besides it's so perfect and she's been saving herself for me.
Okay I can't let you do this! She's lying to you.
What?
She is lying! And I bet I can prove it. Excuse me. Okay. Okay. Yeah-Not a prayer chain, but what looks like a detailed drawing of a bank floor plan. Okay, here's the nametag from the restaurant where she works as a waitress! Not a teacher, a waitress. All right, here's her driver license, this oughta be good, she always lies about this. How old did she say she was?
She told me she was 25.
Oh, I almost don't want to show this. Just remember I'm a minute younger.
I am so stupid. Of course she was lying! She's not a teacher. There's not such a thing as the top secret elementary school for the children of spies.
No. You're not, you're not stupid.
I'm not smart. I just wanted so much to...be impulsive once. To be romantic.
That's good, you should be impulsive and you should be romantic. Just...you did it with the wrong person. What?
It's just so weird, two people look so much alike, and so different.
Eric!! Let's go!!
I'd better go, deal...
Yeah, you should.
Hurry up I gotta pray!!
Hey!
Hey! Well, I had to give the kid fifty bucks to stop crying.
That's not so bad.
No, I also had to go to a couple houses with him as his girlfriend. Oh, I am just awful with children!
Come on! You're good with kids. They're just crazy on Halloween. Y'know, they're all greedy and hopped up on sugar!
Really? You think that's all it is?
Absolutely! Halloween is the worst. Except for Christmas...and their birthdays. Kinda get a little crazy during the summer too. And anytime they're hungry or sleepy. Y'know, kids are tough. Good luck with that.
Look, I wanted to tell I'm-I'm sorry you lost.
Listen, I've got a secret for ya. I let him win.
Is that a secret or a lie.
No, I let him win-Ross!
Yeah?
Would you tell her I let you win please?
Oh. Yeah. Uh Chandler let me win. No, Chandler's really strong. Oh my arm is so sore. Oh nurse!
I am strong! I'll show you!
Chandler please!
Oh what's the matter? Are you scared?
Let's go big bunny!
Okay. 1...2...3-Go! I'm gonna kill myself!
Hey.
Hey.
Oh my God! You cleaned! Look at these floors! You did the windows! Oh, I have been begging you for months and you did! You cleaned! And nagging works!
Y'know uh, I didn't actually do this.
Oh no, was I cleaning in my sleep again?
No, it wasn't you.
Well then who?
I got a maid. Yay!
I hope by maid you mean mistress, because if some other woman was here cleaning then...
Uh honey, I know you don't like to relinquish control...
Oh, relinquish is just a fancy word for lose!
Look, she's really nice. Okay? And she mentioned that she adored the way that you arranged the sponges.
Did she really say that?
Yes, I distinctly remember 'cause I thought it was a joke. Now just give her a chance, okay?
Fine, I can do it. Whew.
What's the matter?
Well, usually when I'm this anxious, I clean!
Who's cell phone is that? It's just so annoying; everywhere you go.
I think it's coming from your bag.
I never get calls!! Hello?
Hi, it's Eric. From the Halloween party, Ursula's fiance.
Oh my God Eric hi! Wait, how'd you get this number?
Oh, I have a friend who's a cop and he got it for me.
Wow! What an incredible violation-and wonderful surprise.
Uh listen, I just-I thought you should know I broke up with Ursula.
Oh you did? He did it! He did it!
Wow! What did he do?
Shhh! I'm talking.
Anyway, I was wondering if, you were the sort of person who...eats lunch.
Are you asking me out? 'Cause it would be kinda weird since you just broke up with my sister.
Yeah uh...okay. I'm-I'm sorry. Bye.
No! Wait! I was just saying that so you'd think I was a good person. Fight for me.
Uhh, I won't take no for an answer.
Not great, but we can work on it at lunch. Okay, I can be at your apartment in two hours.
Great! But wh-wh-How do you know where I live?
I've got friends too. Okay, bye.
Bye.
Oh my God! I'm going out with Eric! Ooh, this day is really gonna be so much better than I thought it was gonna be. Oh Ross, I can't make lunch.
So apparently I'm available for lunch.
I can't. I'm busy. I'm apartment hunting.
You're moving?
Yeah, I can't live with Joey once the baby comes. I don't want my child's first words to be, "How you doin'?"
So does-does Joey know you're moving?
Well, I haven't discussed it with him yet, but I know he's gonna be relieved. Last week, he brought this girl over and I started talking to her about morning sickness and then I showed her pictures from my pregnancy book.
That's not really porn.
Not so much.
Hey, y'know what and if you're looking for a place? I just heard in the elevator this morning that a woman in my building died.
Oh my God! Was she old? Does she have a view?
Well I don't know, but how-how great would that be huh? You living in my building. I could help take care of the baby. I can come over whenever I want. With your permission.
Yeah that would really be great.
Yeah.
Well can we see it?! Oh maybe we shouldn't. I mean if she just died this morning out of respect.
Yeah. No. No you're right.
Shall we?
Yeah.
Yes?
Hi. I'm Ross Geller. I live in the building.
And I'm Rachel, an admirer of the building.
I-I heard about Mrs. Verhoeven passing away and I'm so sorry for your loss.
She didn't pass.
What?
My mother's still alive.
Oh, thank God!
It looked like we were gonna lose her this morning, but she's a tough old bird.
Ahh.
Are you close with her?
Of course! Uh yeah, she and I would talk all the time in-in the laundry room.
You Speak Dutch? Zeer Vereerd Een Vriend Van Mijn Moeder Te Ontmoeten.
Y'know I would it's just painful.
So she's really not dead.
No, she's hanging in there.
Hmm. Do you think-Could you tell me if she's hanging in, in a one bedroom or a two?
Mrs. Bing, this tile cleaner is incredible! Where'd you get it?
Oh well umm, I make it myself! It's two parts ammonia and one part lemon juice. And now the secret ingredient is...y'know what? We just met.
Okay. Uhh, I'm gonna go get the clothes from the laundry room now. And, when I come back I'll clean behind the refrigerator.
I love her.
I'll be back in a minute.
Okay.
See? I told you.
She stole my jeans!
What?
I have been looking for them all week and she is wearing them!
So she stole your pants and then she came back and wore them in front of you?
Don't you see? It's the perfect crime!
She must've been planning this for years!
I will prove it to you! Okay? About a week ago I was wearing those jeans and I dropped a pen in my lap and it left an ink stain on the crotch. Now when she comes back I will find it and show you that stain!
Honey, isn't it possible that the company that sold the jeans made more than just the one pair?
I guess.
So, shouldn't we go give her the benefit of the doubt before we go...snooping around her crotch?
Fine. I'm just glad I didn't give her my secret ingredient.
Out of curiosity, what is your secret ingredient?
Yeah!
Hi!
Come in, I'm so glad you're here.
Yeah, me too. Not in the shaky angry way you are though.
Sorry, I just saw Ursula. I had to give the engagement ring back.
Oh.
Just seeing her brought it all back. All the lies, the way she used me. I just...I got so angry just looking at her......face.
Yeah. Yeah.
I'm sorry. I just...when I look at you I see her. When I see her I get a little bit angry.
Maybe this is too weird.
No wait! There's only a problem when I look at you. Oh I got it! I got it.
No don't tear out your eyes!!
I was just, I was just gonna take out my lenses.
Oh, yeah try that. So, is that better?
Not really. You...you're blurry, but you still look like Ursula. You're Blursula. Okay wait. Maybe...If I-if I just don't look at you for a while. See? It...it works. I'm not, I'm not angry at all anymore! This is a great date!
Look Eric, turn around. Look, I like you, but it shouldn't be this hard. Y'know? This is our first date y'know? First dates are supposed to be about excitement and electricity and 'Ooh, he just touched my hand, did he mean to touch my hand?' and y'know first kisses and......second kisses.
Thanks for the coffee, or bedankt voor de koffie, Gunter.
Jij Spreekt Nederlands? Dat Is Te Gek. Heb Je Familie Daar?
Yeah, we're done.
Ezel.
Ezel? Ezel? Ezel?
Hey Ross! Listen, do you want to go see that new Imax movie on tide pools?
Really?!
No. But I got Knicks tickets for you, me, and Chandler.
Sweet!
All right, well finish your coffee; let's go.
Okay I-I just have to stop by my place first.
To tape the game? You do this every time Ross, you're not gonna be on TV!
No-no, I-I have to see if this apartment became available.
Oh, you're switching apartments?
It's not for me, it's for Rachel.
But Rachel has an apartment.
Yeah, but when the baby comes she's gonna want to move.
She is?
Yeah, you didn't expect her to live there with a baby did you?
I guess I didn't really think about it.
Ezel! Hey Gunther! You're an ezel!
Jij Hebt Seks Met Ezels.
Damnit!
Nice jeans!
Oh thanks! I like your top.
Oh. You're not gettin' it.
What happened?!
Oh, I fell asleep.
I was thinking about taking my lunch break.
Oh, will you do the top of the cabinets? That'll really work up your appetite for lunch.
All right.
Hello.
What's going on?!
I'm sorry. I've never had a maid before, is this not okay?
Hey!
Hey!
How was the game?
Oh, okay. I...I ate way too much.
Oh.
Ooh. So umm, I was talkin' to Ross and he said you were looking for a new place.
Oh yeah! Hopefully across the street if certain Dutch people would just let go.
I was kinda hoping you'd stay.
Oh but Joey, I have to go. There's no room for a baby here.
No room? It's a baby. It's like this big. Y'know, I mean you-you could you could put it over here. Or-or-or we could put it right here. Aw, it's cute, right? Or-or we could put it over here. You wouldn't even notice it. Where's the baby?
Honey, it's not just a matter of where you put it. I mean a baby changes everything. They cry all the time. I mean imagine bringing home some girl and trying to score when there's a screaming baby around.
I could use a challenge! It's getting pretty easy.
Honey, it's so sweet that you want me to stay, but I-I can't do that to you. I mean it would disrupt your entire life.
I love living with you so much. I just wish things didn't have to change.
I know.
Y'know I blame Ross for this.
I do too a little bit.
I'm gonna miss you, you're the hottest roommate I ever had.
Ooh, oh no! I have to go! I have a massage appointment.
Oh no, stay here we'll keep doing this. I'll pay you.
No, I got in trouble for that before. I'll see you later.
Absolutely. I love the way you kiss.
Really? That's the thing I'm worse at! You'll see.
Hi!
Hey! Umm, I think Brenda needs a raise.
How come?
Because I put my head between her legs.
To see her pants?
They're my pants!
Are you sure? Did you see the stain?
No! I was just getting into position and then everything went dark.
God! She is not stealing from us! Okay, will you let this go?
Fine. She's wearing my bra!
Oh dear God!
My pink flowered bra! I recognize the strap!
And yet you don't recognize that you're crazy.
Here's the plan! Okay? I'm going to leave you get a look at Brenda's bra!
Here's another plan...No!
I would do it but she thinks I'm attracted to her!
Why?
Did you not hear where my head was? Come on! Come on we're a team! We're in this together!
I fear a jury will see it the same way!
Do this for me! Come on, I catch you looking at woman's breasts all the time!
You see that?
Do you see this?
All right. Yes. Okay. I get your point. But if it's not your bra will you just let the woman clean the apartment?!
Yes! Absolutely. Okay? Look, you'll know it's mine because on the right cup, the lacey part, there's a very noticeable rip.
You need new clothes.
Hi. How is she?
It's not looking good.
Oh. Oh. Well I uh, I brought her some bloemen.
That's so sweet. Would you like to come in and say good-bye? I'm sure it would mean a lot to her.
Oh I don't know that it would.
Well, her memory is pretty much gone.
All right then.
Hey!
Welcome back!
Hey! Can we pick up where we left off?
I don't know, I'm still pretty tired out from this afternoon.
Why?
Uh, the sex.
What sex?
Our sex.
We didn't have sex.
Well if I didn't have sex with you, I had sex with someone that looked an awful lot like...
Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew!
Oh no! Oh no! Oh no! Oh no! No! No! No!
You-you...you had sex with Ursula?!
Uh, a little bit. She-she-she walked in and I thought she was you and I kissed her and...
You didn't notice she was wearing different clothes?!
Well I was just so excited to see you.
Oh. Ew! Ew! Ew! Ugh! Y'know what? This is too weird.
No-no it's not! I don't want to lose you! It's-it's like I was saying to Ursula when I was making love to her and I thought she was you-Yeah it is too weird.
So I guess this is it.
Yeah. Maybe it's for the best. You smell just like her.
Yeah, so do you.
What are you doing?
I'm leaning. This is where I lean.
Okay. (Goes over and fluffs up the pillows on the couch.
Brenda a bee!
What?
Yes! It's flown into your blouse and you'd better undo your buttons lest it sting you!
I think I know what's going on here.
You do?
Look, I know it must be hard that your wife is a lesbian, but it's wrong. You're married.
I totally understand. Can I just see your bra?
Hi!
Where did you get those jeans?!
You gave them to me!
No I didn't!
All right, I took them. But I figured it would be okay because you got a big ink stain on the crotch.
Oh no! Did you take my bra too?!
What bra?
The pink one with the flowers?!
You mean the one that you're wearing?
I quit!
Sounds about right.
What is this?
Hey! Uh, this is just to give you an idea. Okay well, we can put screens here, so that the baby has privacy, and-and-and maybe a mobile over the crib. And uh-Oh look! Here's a baby monitor , which until the baby comes we can use as walkie-talkies. Huh?
You're so sweet. Oh my God! And you gave the baby Hugsy!
Ahhhhhhhhhhhh.... That-that-that's really just to show where the baby would go. Y'know why don't I hold on to him so that there's no confusion?
But Joey the baby is going to be crying, it's going to be loud.
I'm loud!
It's gonna be up all night!
I'm up all night!
It's gonna poop!
Hello!
What about all the women you want to bring home?
Look, if I'm bringing home a woman who can't stand being around a baby, then maybe I don't want to be with that woman! Or maybe we'll just do it in the bathroom of the club!
Joey, are you sure?
Yeah! All right-Look, I know sometimes it'll be hard, okay? But, it'll also be really...really great. Please Rachel! I-I-I really want you to stay.
I want me to stay too.
Ohh!
Thank you. Oh Joey and look at this crib! It's so cute!
I know! I found it on the street.
Are you serious-Really?! It's in such good condition.
Yeah.
Wow! Whoa-whoa what's under the covers?
I don't know.
It's moving.
Ew.
It's still--It's got a tail! Get it out of here! Get it out of here!!
Ooh! Ah! Okay!
Well, the old lady died. And how do I know? Her dying wish was for one last kiss. But I don't care, because you got the apartment. Yes!
Ewww. Yeah. Umm. I think I'm gonna stay here.
Isn't that great?
Ezels!!
Hey Pheebs?
Huh?
I'm having dinner with my dad tomorrow night, do you wanna come?
Sure. Yeah, he's kinda sexy.
Oh no, no, I'll be there too.
Okay so, we'll just come up with some kind of signal if it's going well you can take off.
No Phoebe! I just need you there for support. I haven't told him I'm pregnant yet.
Oh. Why not?
'Cause I know he's gonna flip out and I hate it when he's angry.
Oh Rachel, this is all so 'Papa don't preach.'
What Phoebe? Wait! One time he caught me smoking he said if he ever saw me doing that again he'd make me eat the entire pack.
Wow! Oh well, I will be there!
Thank you.
Gosh. I'm not gonna let that man make you eat your baby. Oh. Hey! Who is that guy? I think I know him.
No you don't!
No you don't.
Oh my God!!! Monica!! He's the stripper from your bachelorette party!!
Her what?!!
Your secret bachelorette party...
You had a bachelorette party?!
She untied his G-string with her teeth. Somebody stop me!
I thought we weren't gonna have bachelor/bachelorette parties! Y'know, we agreed that it was a silly tradition.
It's a grand tradition!
I'm sorry, they surprised me. There was nothing I could do!
Well you could've untied it with your hands.
This is so unfair! The one thing I wanted to do was throw my best friend a bachelor party, but no, I wasn't allowed to. All I got was a stupid steak dinner!
You went home with the waitress.
Oh yeah, that was a pretty good night.
I can't believe you didn't tell me! You know that the two pillars of marriage are openness and honesty!
Ugh, I knew giving you that book was gonna come back and bite me in the ass!
How about I order everyone the Moroccan chicken?
Oh, I-I don't eat meat.
It's chicken.
Yeah, I don't eat that either.
I'll never understand you lesbians. So baby, tell me...what is new with you.
Well actually umm...
Your '74 Lafite sir.
'74?! I ordered the '75! That's a magnificent wine! The '74 is sewage! Why would you bring me sewage?! Is that a hard question? Are you an idiot? Is that why you're a waiter?
This is why I told the manager I wouldn't wait on you tonight!
Oh come on! Don't be such a baby!
In case you didn't notice, that is a scary man.
He's right though, the '74 is absolute piss.
This was such a huge mistake. I can't tell him Phoebe. I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't...
Rachel!
No it's okay, this is what's gonna happen. I'm gonna wait a couple years and then the baby will tell him.
Why, so he can get mad at the baby?
Hey, that is the...baby's problem. Oh, everything okay with the waiter?
I have no idea, I went to the bathroom. So sweetie, you were starting to tell me what is uh, what is new with you.
Well... Umm, I got TiVo.
What's TiVo?
It's slang for pregnant.
Phoebe!
Are you really pregnant?
Well uh, yes and no. Except not no. So to sum it up, yeah.
Who is the father? Oh no! Please don't tell me it's her!
No, it's Ross. It's Ross. You like Ross. Oh daddy, I hope you're okay with all of this. I mean think about it, this is a good thing. You're gonna-This is your first grandchild! You're gonna be a poppy!
That's true.
Yeah.
Poppy. Oh, I'm gonna be a poppy. So when is the wedding?
Who?
The wedding! There's going to be a wedding. Young lady, don't you sit there and tell me my first grandchild is going to be a bastard! Rachel Karen Green, tell me there is gonna be a wedding!!
February 2nd!
So it was really cool seeing you lecture today.
Oh thanks. Although it kinda seemed like you were falling asleep there a little.
Oh no-no, I-I had my eyes closed so I could concentrate and y'know take it all in.
Yeah, a lot of my students do that.
So, I gotta get going.
Okay, I-I'll see you tonight.
Yeah.
Okay, bye.
Oh hey, thanks again for showing me your semi-precious stone collection. It was amazing!
My God! You must be good in bed!
So uh, you and Mona, been a while now. How's it going?
Ah, it's good. It's going good. I mean, we get along great. She's, she's so...
Hot?
Well, I was gonna say sweet, but yeah-huh!
She's okay with Rachel and the baby?
Well I...I haven't actually told her yet. I don't want to scare her off, y'know?
Well, you have to honest with her! Otherwise you may think that you're going down the same path, but you're really going down different ones.
I'm gonna take that book and beat you to death with it.
Oh my God! You are gonna love me so much! I felt really bad about the whole bachelorette party thing, so tonight you're gonna have a bachelor party.
What?
Yeah, I got this number from this guy at work and I hired a stripper to come dance for you. Am I going in the wife hall of fame or what?!
Honey! That's crazy! I don't want you to get me a stripper...
Will you let the lady talk?!
Come on! Come on, it'll be fun! It'll make me feel so much better.
Look, I appreciate it, but uh, it's a little creepy. Y'know? I'm not a bachelor anymore.
So don't think of it as a bachelor party, think of it as a...a two month anniversary present.
Sure, one year is paper, but two months is lapdance!
Please! I feel so bad! Just watch the hot woman get naked!
All right fine! But I'm only doing this for you!
Yeah!
And Joey.
Thank you. All right, now who else do you want to invite?
Ah, no-no-no just Ross. Ross and Joey is embarrassing enough.
Uh actually, sorry I can't even make it. I'm seeing Mona again tonight.
I Understand who would cancel an actual date to go to a fake bachelor party?
I'm sorry I gotta cancel tonight baby...
I'm sorry I won't be able to make it to your imaginary wedding, but I'm really busy that day. Yeah, I already have a unicorn baptism and a leprechaun bar mitzvah.
I know. I know. I panicked, I panicked. I didn't want him to start yelling at me like I was some '74 Latour.
It's Lafite. The '74 Latour is actually drinking quite nicely.
All right here he comes. I'm gonna do this, I'm gonna tell him, I'm gonna be strong.
I just called a friend of mine.
Yeah?
I think I may be able to book The Plaza on short notice.
Really?! The Plaza?!! Oh daddy!! Right. Daddy, I need to talk to you. Please, sit down.
What is it sweetie?
There's not gonna be a wedding. Ross and I are not getting married.
What?!
I'm sorry daddy.
I don't believe this!!
Oh now daddy, stay calm. Please.
Stay calm?!! How do you expect me to stay calm?! This is unacceptable Rachel! And I wanna know why?!! Is it because that punk Ross won't marry you?! That's it! Is that it?!
Yes. Yes, he says I'm damaged goods.
So you uh, nervous about getting married?
What are you doing?
Look, look let's pretend it's a real bachelor party. Okay? Y'know? Before your wedding. Come on, it'll be fun.
Okay. I can't believe tomorrow's the big day.
How does it feel knowing you're never gonna be with another woman again huh? Knowing you're gonna have to wake up to the same face everyday until you finally have the sweet release of death.
You're right, this is more fun.
That's her! Okay, come on!
Hi!
Hi.
So which one of you lucky boys is Chandler?
Uh, that-that's-that's me!
That's me.
Joey Tribbiani, a big fan.
So is that a bedroom?
Yeah, yeah right over there.
All right, whenever you're ready.
That was weird.
Why-why would she go in the bedroom?
I'm waiting.
So she's a...
Yeah, that's one naked hooker!
I love your place! Where is this guy from?
Uh that's an eighteenth century Indian artifact from Calcutta.
Oh wow! So, you're more than just dinosaurs.
So much more.
Oh my God! Oh my God! I'm so sorry!
Aw forget it, it's from Pier One. Sorry.
You think you can knock up my daughter and then not marry her?! I'm gonna kill you!!
Y'know this is actually not a great time for me.
So? Come on! Explain yourself Geller! First you get my Rachel pregnant!
You got Rachel pregnant?!
Who did?!
You did!
Yes. Yes, yes I did. But-but it was, it was just a one night thing. It meant nothing.
Oh? Really? That's what my daughter means to you? Nothing?
No! No sir umm, she means a lot to me. I mean, I care-I-I love Rachel.
What?!
Oh but not that way. I mean...I mean I'm not in love with her. I love her like a, like a friend.
Oh really? That's how treat a friend? You get her in trouble and then refuse to marry her?
Hey! I offered to marry her!
Wh...
But I didn't want to.
Well why not? So you can spend your time with this tramp?!
Tramp?!
I'm sorry. Dr. Green, Mona. Mona, Dr. Green.
I can't believe there is a naked hooker in there!
Wait! Wait! Maybe she's a hooker and a stripper, but she got confused about what she's supposed to do.
Could be. I mean technically she did strip, we just, we just missed it. Ma'am, are you also a stripper?
Uh, no. But I could pretend to strip, but that's gonna cost extra. Okay, here's the extras, handcuffs, spanking...
Maybe Monica's playing a joke on ya. Y'know? Getting her own husband a hooker, that's pretty funny.
That is funny, maybe for my birthday she'll murder someone.
I bet Ross was in on it too. I mean he was conveniently busy.
Do you mind if I smoke in here?
Oh actually, I'd rather you...Yeah, go ahead. We're gonna have to burn that room down anyway.
How could you have kept all of this from me?
I was going to tell you, but...
But what?! You figured you'd get what you wanted and then dump her like you dumped Rachel!
Hey! I did not dump Rachel! Nor are we still together. Can I just... Why don't we just let the machine get that?
Hey Ross. It's Joey. There's a hooker over here and we thought maybe you'd know something about it.
No! No! No! No! No! I-I-I-I-I need to, I need to lie down.
So, tonight's the night of the big bachelor party?
Yeah! Hey! Thanks for getting me that girl's number.
No problem. So who's the party for?
My husband.
You hired your husband a hooker?
She's a stripper.
No, she's a hooker.
Is that, is that what they call strippers sometimes?
When they're hookers.
Oh my God Stu! I-I can't believe you did this! Now are you absolutely sure she's a hooker?
Either that or she's just the best, most expensive date I ever had.
Maybe she meant to get you a hooker.
Why would she do that?
Maybe she wants you to learn something. Huh? Now is there anything you're really bad at y'know, sexually?
This is the worst bachelor party ever!
What's taking you boys so long?
In a minute!
In a minute? What's gonna happen in a minute?!
All right, all right maybe-maybe you should just ask her to leave.
Why me?!
Hey! It's your bachelor party.
Which is why you should do it.
I don't want to. You do it!
You do it!
You do it!
All right Rock, Paper, Scissors who has to tell the whore to leave! What?
I miss this.
I don't think we've actually done this before!
No, I-I miss hanging out with you.
Well we...we still hang out.
Not like we used to. Remember? You and me used to be inseparable. Y'know now it's like...things are different.
Well y'know, things are different. I'm...I'm married now.
Oh sure-And hey, don't get me wrong, I am so happy for you guys. I just...I miss...hanging out...just-just us, y'know?
Yeah, I miss that too. I tell you what; from now on we'll make time to hang out with each other.
You got it. Come here.
Oh God! Listen, I am this close to robbing you guys.
She's a hooker! She's a hooker! She's a... Hi! Uh, we spoke on the phone.
So your dad dropped by. He's a pleasant man!
Oh no...
I'D Better Go. Just Over Here I don't want to miss the fight.
Ross I'm so sorry. Okay. I-I will promise I will straighten this out with him tomorrow in person, or via e-mail.
I don't care about your dad! I care about Mona! She was there and now she's totally freaked out!
Oh okay, I'll fix that to. What's her e-mail address?
Rachel!
All right, I promise. I'll fix this. I swear. I'll-I'll-I'll-I'll talk to her.
Okay!
Okay.
Thank you!
That's it?! You call that a fight? Come on! "We were on a break!" "No we weren't!" What happened to you two?!
Thank you so much for coming back over.
Oh good, you're here. Yeah, and I was worried that it was going to be uncomfortable.
I know Mona, just hear me out. First of all, I'm so sorry about my father yelling at you, but I heard you totally held your own. You're gonna have to tell me how you did that.
Focus.
Okay. Um...But-Okay, yes Ross and I used to date. And yes we are gonna have a baby. But we are definitely not getting back together.
How can I be sure on that?
Oh we just-we drove each other crazy!
Yeah.
I mean he was possessive, he was jealous, he could never just let the little things go!
Trying to date this woman.
Right! But, none of that compared to how kind and-and how gentle and thoughtful he is.
Probably shouldn't touch me.
Y'know, I-I-I just...I don't want to get in the middle of something so complicated.
I know, I get it, but Mona, what relationship is not complicated? I mean we all have our baggage! You must too! Why else would you still be single? I am so gonna leave right now.
Should I leave this open for you too?
I'm not sure yet. Why didn't you just tell me about all this?
Because what's going on with Rachel has nothing to do with how I feel about you.
Yeah? Well you still shoulda told me.
I know and I was going to, but I thought it was better that you heard it from Rachel's father. Look I...I made a mistake, but it's only because I really, really like you. Really!
Okay, I guess you can...close the door now.
Forgot my purse! Oh, you guys made up. He's a good kisser isn't he? I'm going!
I swear I didn't know she was a hooker! I mean wh-Did you let her smoke in here?
Her ass print is still on your grandmother's quilt, do you really want to talk about smoking?
Y'know what? I'm gonna make this up to you. I promised you a stripper , and you're gonna get a stripper.
Monica! Wait!
What?
Carry on.
Ooh, these tennis shoes are so tight. I think I'll take them off.
Could you not narrate?
Gotcha sailor.
...just because you're not in love with the guy you can't...
Wow, you told your dad the truth.
About an hour ago.
Wanna go see a movie?
Yes! Bye daddy.
...there's gonna be a wedding! That's unacceptable Rachel! What the hell does love have to do with it anyway?! There are more important things in a marriage other than love! ...constantly thinking about things! You have to think about the consequences of your decision.
Hey! I do too think about the consequences of my decisions! What gives you the right to... Go to hell! Stupid guy on my phone.
Hey Rach listen, did you know that during pregnancy your fingers swell up to twice their size and never go back.
Oh my...God! Let me see that!
You fall for it every time!
Hey!
Hi!
I brought you my old maternity clothes!
Oh Pheebs that's so sweet--Ooh, those are so cute!
Yeah! And look, see how they expand as the baby grows? And then after the baby's born, they're great for shoplifting melons.
Oh good you're all here. Thanksgiving tomorrow, four o'clock. Oh, guess who I invited. Remember that guy Will Colbert from high school?
No.
He was in Ross's class...marching band...kinda overweight? Well, really overweight. I mean I was his thin friend.
Wow! I don't remember him. Honey, are you sure you're not talking about your imaginary boyfriend.
No that was Jarred! Wow! I haven't thought about him in a long time... Anyway, umm Will's, Will's here on business and he didn't have a place to go so I invited him here.
Oh that's nice.
Oh, and by the way, he's lost a bunch of weight. I mean he looks goo-ood! Okay, I mean really, really gorgeous! I still love Chandler.
I just want you to say it once in a while.
All right okay, just so you know, I'm not gonna make a turkey this year.
What?!
Well Phoebe doesn't eat turkey...
Phoebe!
Turkey's are beautiful, intelligent animals!
No they're not! They're ugly and stupid and delicious!
All right! Okay, it's just Phoebe. Will's still on a diet, Chandler doesn't eat Thanksgiving food, and Rachel's having her aversion to poultry.
She is?
Remember I had to leave the room the other day when you had that roast chicken?
Yeah. But I thought that was because I put the whole thing on my hand and made it walk across the table.
Anyway, it just doesn't seem worth it to make a whole turkey for just three people. Okay? It's a lot of work.
But you gotta have turkey on Thanksgiving! I mean, Thanksgiving with no turkey is like-like Fourth of July with no apple pie! Or Friday with no two pizzas!
All right fine! If it means that much to you! But just-there's gonna be a ton left over.
No there won't! I promise I will finish that turkey!
All right, you're telling me you can eat an entire turkey in just one sitting?
That's right! 'Cause I'm a Tribbiani! And this is what we do! I mean we may not be great thinkers or world leaders, we don't read a lot or run very fast, but damnit! We can eat!
Hey, isn't weird to think about how next year at this time they'll be a little baby at the table? Rachel's! But good to know where you're at!
Hey!
Hey!
Happy Thanksgiving!
You too!
Anything I can do to help?
Actually there is. Chandler usually helps me with this, but he's really into the game so I don't want to bother him. Could you help me fold these napkins?
Sure!
I'm gonna go across the hall to check on the yams.
Okay.
No! No! No! No sweetie! No! Not like that! We're not at a barn dance. You've gotta-you wanna fold them like swans. Like I showed you at Christmas time, remember?
Yeah, it all just came screaming back to me. So how's the game?
I have no idea.
What?
Yeah! I'm just pretending to watch the game so I don't have to help out with stuff.
I don't believe you! That is...brilliant! And Monica has no idea?
Nope! Every once and a while I just scream stuff at the TV.
Is your team winning hon?
Yeah! Anderson just scored again! There's no Anderson.
Well I want to get in on this. Hey Mon? I don't think I can help you after all, I didn't realize this game was on.
Oh, I didn't know you liked football.
Well normally I don't, but y'know......Green Bay is playing.
You like Green Bay?
Well it's only like my favorite bay! {Actually, it's not bad. It just gets a little cold in winter, but in Wisconsin winter only lasts from August to June. J }
Hey!
Hey!
Happy Thanksgiving!
Aww thanks! God Will I'm so glad that you came! You look great! You must've lost like...
150 pounds. Yeah, I'm gonna be in one of those Subway sandwich commercials.
A pie!
Oh right. All right, it's no fat, it's no sugar, it's no dairy...it's no good. Throw it out.
You wanna meet some people? This is uh; this is my husband Chandler. Chandler, this is Will.
Hey.
Oh hey. I'd shake your hand but uh; I'm really into the game. Plus, I think it'd be better for my ego if we didn't stand right next to each other.
This is Phoebe.
Hey. Wow! Well done.
Wanna give me a hand?
Sure! Monica, I can't get over how great you look! You look stunning!
Well you look incredible too! You're just-you're so fit!
I'm watching the game, but I'm not deaf!
Oh umm, I meant to tell you, Ross is coming.
Ross is coming. Great! I love Ross!
Good. And Rachel Green too.
Oh.
Is there a problem?
Nope. Uh, it's okay. It's just uh, God I hated her.
What?
Yeah, I hated her. She was horrible to me in high school. But hey, it was a long time ago, I'm in a good place, it might be actually fun to see her again. You got any cakes or cookies or something? No Will no!
Y'know, it's been a while since we've screamed something. Maybe we should.
Oh okay.
Oh come on!
Noooo!! Damn you ref! You burn in hell!!!
Hey, what are you doing? You gotta save room, you've got almost an entire turkey to eat.
Let me explain to you how the human body works. I have to warm my stomach first. Eatin' chips is like stretching.
All right.
Don't worry, Tribbianis never get full.
I actually know what you're talking about. I'm here to tell you something my friend, you can eat and eat and eat but nothing will ever fill that void.
Who the hell is this guy?
Will! From high school.
Oh hey!
Joey.
Hello.
Will!
Ross!
Hey-hey you came! Man you look incredible! Hot stuff! Hot stuff?
It's good to see you man.
Yeah, you too. Man, so-so what are you up to?
I'm a commodities broker.
Really? Yeah that-that sounds interesting.
Yeah, it's not. But I'm rich and thin.
Oh! Man I don't think I've seen you since uh, Lance Davis' graduation party.
That was such a fun night!
Yeah. It would've been good if we had gotten in, but still real fun.
Yeah.
Yeah.
God we were lame back then. Do you remember how into dinosaurs we were?
Yeah.
So what do you, what do you do now?
So how long are you in town?
Hi!
Hey sweetie. Oh good.
Rachel Green.
Aw-oh, that's right. Are-are you gonna be okay?
Oh, I'll-I'll be fine. Just God I hate her Ross! I hate her!
Will, high school was-was a long time ago.
Look At Her Standing There With Those Yams! My Two Greatest Enemies Ross Rachel Green and complex carbohydrates.
Oh my God Monica, who is that?
That's Will from high school!
Oh! I do not remember him! Wow! He's really got that sexy, smoldering thing going on. Oh my God, he's... Look at the way he's just staring at me. I think he's trying to mouth something to me, but I can't make it out.
Okay, dinner's ready!
Good game!
Yeah.
Yeah. Solid effort. Solid effort.
Oh, so who won?
Green Bay.
Detroit.
What?
Well the Lions technically won, but it was a moral victory for the Green Bay...Mermen.
Hi! Will, right?
Right.
Hi! I'm Rachel Green.
Oh I-I remember you.
Really?! Aren't you sweet! I gotta tell you though, I am, I am having the hardest time placing you. Oh-oh hang on! Did we umm, did we fool around at Lance Davis' graduation party?
You are unbelievable.
Thank you!
Uh Rachel? Rachel, why don't you sit here? And Will you sit way over there.
That's it?! Even if nobody helps me I can eat that no problem. At least give me a challenge!
This is Chandler's chicken. This is the turkey.
Oh. How-how big is that?
About nineteen pounds.
It's like me when I was born.
All right, who would uh, like some yams? Will?
Oh, you'd like that wouldn't ya?
What? Oh y'know what? Can we please keep the chicken and the turkey and everything on the other side of the table? The smell is just yuck!
Typical.
I'm sorry. What?
I said it was typical. Typical of you, Rachel Green, Queen Rachel does whatever she wants in little Rachel land.
Seriously, who is this guy?
Umm, I'm sorry. Do you-do you have a problem with me?
I don't know? Do I? Do I?
I think you do.
Apparently you were umm, a little mean to him in high school.
A little mean? You made my life miserable!
I'm-I'm-I had no idea. I'm sorry. I...
Well you should be. Screw it! Bring on the yams!
Oh Will. But you-you've worked so hard...
Yams!!!!
Okay.
Uh Will umm, I just want to say that I'm real sorry for whatever I-I did to you in high school...
Oh, it wasn't just me. We had a club!
You had a club?!
That's right, The I Hate Rachel Green Club!
Whoa! My God! So what, you all just joined together to hate me?! Who else was in this club?
Me and Ross.
No need to point, she knows who Ross is.
So you were in an I Hate Rachel club?
Yes he was.
No. No.
So who else was in this club?
Uh actually, there-there was also that exchange student from Thailand but I-I don't think he-he knew what it was.
So Ross, we went out for two years, and you never told me you were in an I Hate Rachel club.
You went out with her?! We had a pact!
That was in high school! It's not like it was binding forever.
Then why did it have the word eternity in it?
Okay Monica, did you know about this?!
I swear I didn't. Hey! Is that why you guys used to go up to your bedroom and lock the door?
Yeah.
Hmm, a little relieved, I gotta say.
Look Rach I-I'm sorry, okay? I...I was a stupid kid, okay? The only reason I joined...
Co-founded!
...co-founded. Co-founded the club was because I was insanely in love with you. Obviously I didn't handle it very well. But if you think about it the I Hate Rachel Club was really the I Love Rachel Club.
Uh, except that it was really the I Hate Rachel Club.
Okay. So what? You guys would just like get together and like just say mean things about me?
Well, we did a little more than that.
No-no! No-no. No-no.
What?! What else did you do?
We started a rumor.
What rumor?
Oh, come on Will! Just take off your shirt and tell us!
Ross!
It was no big deal. We-we...said that the rumor was...that umm...you had both...male and female reproductive parts.
What?!
That's right! We said your parents flipped a coin, decided to raise you as a girl, but you still had a hint of a penis.
Oh my God!
You started that?!
What?! You heard that?!
Everyone at our school heard it!
Everybody at my school heard it! You were the hermaphrodite cheerleader from Long Island?!
Oh no!!!! Oh my God!! This is all making so much sense to me now! This is why Adam Carter wouldn't go out with me! This is why Billy Tratt would just stay in this region!
Actually, Billy Tratt is gay now. So-so that one's not really our fault.
Monica, how come you never told me this?!
I thought it might be true. And I was afraid that you were gonna cry and then show it to me.
Joey stop staring! There's nothing there! It's not true!
I'm afraid I'm gonna need proof.
Oh!
You are my Everest.
Joey, you don't have to finish that.
Oh yes I do. Otherwise what's next? Today I'm just a guy who can't finish a turkey, but tomorrow I'm the guy who eats half a Powerbar, wraps up the rest, and puts in the fridge? No! No, I just...I just-I gotta change my pants. Jeans have no give.
Okay! Okay! Listen to what Sean McMahon wrote in my yearbook senior year, "Dear Rach, you're such a good person." Not girl! Person!
Rach, I think you're reading a little too much into it.
"Dear Rach, you're a great person. Sorry about your tiney-wienie."
Look, what do you want me to do? Do you want me to call everyone in the entire school and tell them it wasn't true?!
Yes!
Could you also tell them I'm skinny now?
Oh! Me too!
Well look-look I'm not calling anybody! Okay? It was like a million years ago!
I don't care how long ago it was! You told people that I was half and half! Y'know what? I just want to point out I never did anything to hurt you in high school.
That's not totally true.
What?
What?
Well you-you did start that rumor about Ross making out with Mrs. Altman, our 50-year-old librarian.
How did you know that?!!!!
It's true?!!
No.
Yes it is! I saw you guys going at it behind the card catalog!
Mrs. Altman? She also made out with Takaka Ci-Kek the night before he went back to Thailand.
I'm sorry. When you were in high school you made out with a 50-year-old woman?
Hey! She didn't look 50!
Did she look 16?
Ohh, there's a picture of her in the yearbook actually.
Oh! Wow!
She didn't photograph well!
Well, she probably wasn't familiar with the process having spent most of her life sitting for oil paintings!
So how did this happen? Did she, did she lure you to an early bird dinner?
I was working late in the library one afternoon. It was just the two of us. She needed some help with her word jumble. And one thing led to another. If you must know, Anita was very gentle and tender. May she rest in peace...
Didn't she walk with a cane?
Only when it was damp!! I can't believe you-you told people about this?! Everybody knew?! Y'know what? I'm back in the club!
Yeah!
I wanna join!
Wh-Phoebe!!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I never got to be in a club. I-I didn't go to high school, but three of us would meet behind a dumpster to learn French. Bonjour.
All right, y'know-Fine! You guys have your stupid little club, but I would just like to say is what you did to me is way worse than what I did to you! You gave me a tiney-wienie!
All right, listen you're just being silly. Rachel, even with that rumor you were one of the most popular girls in school and everyone wanted to be like you. One girl wanted to be like you so much she stuffed her pants with a Tootsie Roll!
Wow...
And Ross, if it weren't for Rachel's rumor I mean no one in high school would even know who you were. She put you on the map!
As a romancer of the elderly.
Hey! Mrs. Altman was the kind of woman you could tell she used to be pretty.
The eyes...did still sparkle.
Hey guys this stuff is just so way in the past. You-you've been through so much since then. And right now you've got so much more important stuff going on in your life. Can't you just let this go?
She's right.
Yeah. I mean we are having a baby together.
Hold on! You got her pregnant?
Yeah.
Are ya getting married?
Nope.
So you knocked her up but you're not gonna marry her. Dude! Anybody?
Okay. It's exactly how I'd imagined it would be.
All right where's that turkey!
Joey! Those are my maternity pants!
Not now! These are my Thanksgiving pants!
Well that's it. I'm done. Whew! There come the meat sweats.
Well Joey, we're all...we're all very proud of you.
Yes, I believe we can expect a call from the President any moment now.
Is there anything we can do for you?
No just, nobody press on my stomach.
You can keep those pants by the way.
Whoa-hey-wh-wh-what do you got there? What is that? Pie?
Yeah, you want some?
Ah, just cut me a little sliver. A little bigger. Little bigger. What?! Are you afraid you're gonna run out?! Cut me a real piece!
Hey! So what do you think?
New haircut? Necklace? Dress? Boots? Boots!
Yes! Now, they're a little more than I normally spend on boots...or rent
Oh my God!
I know.
I'm gonna miss being able to afford food.
I'm sorry, they just, they just look so good! And the saleswoman was looking at me like, "Oh, these are way too expensive for you."
She had a point.
Hi!
Hey.
Oh my God! Oh Monica! Those boots are amazing!
They're mine!
Yeah well, too bad we're gonna have to return them.
Return them?! Shh! They're gonna hear you!
Honey, I'm not returning them. Okay? I mean I-I know they cost a lot, but I'm going to wear them all the time. You'll see. Besides, I love the compliments. I mean, have you ever had something so beautiful everyone wanted it?
I have you.
Nice try; I'm keeping the boots.
That's right, I love you! And-and I'm gonna play with you all the time.
How can you let him talk to your crotch like that?
He's talking to the baby.
Ohh! Okay! Okay, cause when-when he said, "I can't wait to hear your first words," I thought, "There's a trick."
Okay. Well, I gotta go you guys. I'll see you later.
Okay.
Bye.
Bye.
Oh hey Rach, listen-Hi!
Hi.
Umm, can you do me a favor? I was talkin' to my sister and she knows you work at Ralph Lauren...
No, forget it! No way! I am not sending anymore Ralph Lauren clothes to prison. It is a waste.
No-no-no-no-no-no, not her, not her. My youngest sister, Dina, she's really interested in fashion, and she wants to talk to someone successful, y'know, to give her some advice.
I guess I can talk to one of my supervisors...
Oh no-no-no-no, she wants to talk to you!
Really?! Oh my God! I'm successful!
Okay, so will you meet with her?
Yes! I'd love to! Have her come by the office.
Great! Thanks! You're gonna love her so much. And-Oh, she's the smartest of all the Tribbiani children. Hey, y'know the S.A.T's?
Yeah.
She took 'em!
Hey Ross! Doesn't Ben go to the Smithfield Day School?
Yeah. Why?
Sting has a son that goes there too!
Yeah I know; he's in Ben's class.
You knew this and you never said anything?! With all the stupid dinosaur stuff you tell us?!
Fine! No more dinosaur stuff! Can I talk about fossils?
Sting's son, seven years old and there's a picture.
What are you reading? The Kidnappers Guide to Manhattan Private Schools?
No, it's New York magazine. It's an article about the best schools in the city. So how well do you know Sting?
Uh, I actually haven't even met him.
Uh-huh, yeah that's too bad. I really want to go to his concert Friday night, but it's totally sold out. I know! Why don't you meet him and get tickets?! If you get two I'll take you.
Well actually, I'm picking Ben up tomorrow, maybe he'll be there.
There you go! Oh, you are so lucky! You might actually get to meet Sting tomorrow! That's why you have kids!
Hey guys!
Hey-hey.
Hi Monica!
Hey.
Hi boots.
See Chandler? I'm getting a lot of use out of them already! They're very practical. See, you can wear them with dresses, with skirts, with pants...
You can wear them with shorts on a street corner and earn the money to pay for them.
Wow! They're beautiful!
Ahh...
They hurt so much!
What?!
The guy who made these hates feet and wants to see them die!
Well-well you can give them to me! I haven't felt my feet in years!
I can't! I spent so much money on them and I told Chandler that I'd wear them all the time, I just can't give them away!
Well then get your money back and return them!
I can't do that either! The soles' are already a little scuffed up and the insides are filled with my blood.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey I uh just picked up Ben from school...
I don't think you did a very thorough job!
I dropped him off at Carol's. Anyway, it turns out that I'm not going to be able to get those tickets though.
Oh no! Why not?
Well it turns out that Ben and Sting's son do not get along.
How come?!
Apparently, Sting's son made fun of the fact that Ben's moms are lesbinims.
Wait! But Ross if they don't get along then you should smooth things over. Make them be friends.
Phoebe, you can't force kids to be friends.
Sure you can! Give them some blocks, put them in a playpen!
Playpen?! Ben's seven!
Your kid is seven?! He's really small. Please! Please get the tickets!
Look I'm sorry Pheebs, I can't do it.
Yes you can! Sting says so himself!
What?
Rosssss can!
Look Phoebe, I'm sorry it's just...
Rossss can!
Phoebe, I...
Rosss can! Give me the tickets! Ross can give me the tickets!!
Here she is! Future fashion superstar!
Oh Joey, I'm hardly a...
My little sister Dina!
Right! Hi Dina!
Hi.
Nice to meet you.
Thanks so much for meetin' with me. Joey's told me so much about you!
This is so exciting for her. Well, I'll let you two fash...ists get down to business.
Okay. All right Dina, well let's talk about the different areas of fashion that you could get involved in. Let's see, there's design, but you may need a whole other degree for that. Uh, there's-there's sales, which is great because you get to travel...
I...I don't care about fashion! I'm pregnant! And I know you are too, so you gotta help me!
And there's marketing...
Ahhhhhhhh!
What's wrong?
Oh nothing I'm just-just was yawning.
Oh don't forget, my office holiday party is tonight.
Honey, we don't really have to go to this thing tonight do we?
Now sweetie, I know you don't like my office parties, but you can wear your new boots. See? Every cloud has a...supple leather lining.
I-I don't-I don't think that I'm gonna wear the boots tonight.
Why not?
Well y'know, I'm just-I'm just worried that bosses will see them and think they pay you too much money. Or! Or your assistant will see them and-and want a raise!
Do you think I work at some kind of boot pricing company?
Anyway, I picked up this outfit that I want to wear and the, and the boots don't really go with it.
You said that you paid all that money because those boots go with skirts, dresses, and pants!
Fine! If you want me to wear the boots, I'll wear the boots. In fact, I'll go into my room right now and y'know try the outfit on.
Okay.
Okay? Ooo wee! Christmas party in my boots!
I-I can't go in there. I can't tell him!
Honey, it's going to be okay. He's been incredibly supportive of me, and if he gets a little upset; that's what the meatball sub is for.
Thank you.
Okay.
Hey! It's my fashion girls! What's wrong?
Honey, why don't you sit down? Dina has something that she wants to tell you.
Oh. What's, what's going on? Is it mom? Is she sick? Is it dad's heart? Is that a sandwich?
Joe, mom and dad are fine...
Is that a sandwich?!
Joey...there's something that you...should know. Dina?
I'm pregnant.
What?!
Now! Give him the sandwich! Give him the sandwich!
Well obviously this is a mistake! You can't be pregnant! Because you have to have sex to get pregnant!
Joe, I tried to wait until I was 25 like you did!
What?! Dina...
Bub!!! I can't believe this! You're the good one! You went to college! Both years! Who did this to you?!
Bobby Corso, but he's a real nice guy. I like him a lot. He's real funny.
You got pregnant for funny?! Dina...if he's funny...laugh! All right, I'll be back in a little while! You stay here!
Why? Where are you going?
I can't look at you right now!
Wow.
I know.
Oh, there you are Ben!
Aunt Phoebe, what are you doing here?
Well, I heard you're having a problem with one of the boys in your class. And so I thought I would just come down here and sit you both down, have a little talk and make it all okay. Now umm, the boy's name is Sting's son.
Jack? I hate him! He's a jerk.
Now Ben, sometimes people may seem like jerks on the outside, but they have famous fathers.
I have to go. My friend Doug is waiting for me over there.
Him you're friends with.
Excuse me. Can, can I help you with something?
Yes! Yes you can, I'm looking for Jack's parents.
Are you with one of the students?
Uh-huh, I'm with Ben.
Are you one of Ben's mothers?
I am one of Ben's mothers. I'm a lesbian. It was, it was difficult coming out to my parents.
Well hi, I'm Jenny Boone. I'm the new teacher here.
Oh.
I've only met your partner Carol.
Ah! Okay so that would make me Susan.
Right. Are you looking for Jack's parents to discuss the problems he's having with Ben? Yeah. Because I really do think the parents should sit down and have a conversation.
Yeah! Let's do that!! That-that sounds good. We should sit down and talk, just me, my lover Carol, and the Stings. Umm, how-how will I get in touch with them?
Oh, their number is on the contact sheet.
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Umm, could-could I get a copy of that? 'Cause Carol threw it out, she lost ours. She's such a scatterbrain, but man what a hot piece of ass.
Y'know, that party wasn't bad.
Yeah! I didn't know there would be dancing. That was a fun surprise!
I don't see any uh, cabs. Maybe we should just walk?
Oh no, we can't walk!
What honey, it's like fifteen blocks to the subway. Let's go.
Hey! Do you think that we can get to the subway right there if we climb down through the manhole cover?
What's going on?
I can't walk. Okay? Okay? These boots were a huge mistake!
What?
Okay you were right! All right, I never should have bought them! They're killing me! One toe at a time!
So I was right. This is what it feels like to be right. It's oddly unsettling.
How are we gonna get home? Maybe a piggy-back ride?
Hop on.
Okay. Wait, just give me a second, I need to just get my boots off first. Ah...Ooh...Oohh...Ohh...Oh God...Ohh...Oh...Ohh...Ohhhh...
Honey, I know you're in pain right now, but I'm a little turned on.
Do you ever worry that you'll be walking and your baby will just like slip out?
What college was that Dina?
Oh my God! Bobby!
Hi Dina. Good to see you.
Joey, what are you doing?
Just what needs to be done! Dearly beloved, we are gathered here to join this man and this woman...
Oh Joey this is crazy!
Don't interrupt me when I'm talkin' to God! Now where were we? Oh right, okay. Do you Dina, take this man...
No!
Oh you'll take 'em!
No I won't!
Hey! You don't get a say in this!
Yes I do!
Ahhh! I heard "I do", we're halfway there! Okay! You!
All right Joey! That is enough! Listen, as beautiful and moving as this ceremony is, it's not legal. Okay? They-they don't have a marriage license, they don't have any witnesses, and the groom only has on one shoe!
Yeah, he took the other one off and hit me with it.
Well what am I supposed to do?
You're supposed to realize that they are adults! And that they can make their own decisions.
No they can't! They were stupid enough to get knocked up!
Heyyyyy! Contraceptives are not always effective! Right?
Yeah...we kinda didn't use any...
Oh, come on kids! A little help here!
Wow! This place is incredible! Sting's pen...that he gave to Phoebe. Come on! Secret passageway!
Hi!
Hi!
I'm Trudie.
Uh-huh.
You must be Ben's mum.
Why else would I be here?
Do sit down.
Uh-huh.
I gather Jack and Ben haven't been getting along lately.
Yeah.
I'm told there are two sides to this story, but all I've heard is that Ben's a bit of a poo-poo head.
Umm, I'm sorry. Won't-won't Jack's father be joining us?
Oh I'm sorry, Jack's father is not available.
Uh-hmm. Okay. Well then, could we reschedule? For say, Friday night perhaps at 8 o'clock?
Oh no, I know that wouldn't work. My husband's in concert.
Concert. Yeah. That does put us in...quite a pickle. Because you see I'm very busy before and after the concert, and he's obviously busy during.
So, I guess you and I should talk about Jack and Ben right now.
Unless! Unless umm, okay I-I would be willing to go to the concert, umm, all the while thinking about the children of course.
Are you here for tickets?
Oh, thank you. Four would be great.
I'm not giving concert tickets to someone who'd use their son like this!
Oh good! Then you're in luck! Ben's not my son!
Look, I've just pressed a button, triggering a silent alarm. Any minute now, the police will be here!
The Police? Here? A reunion?!
Okay, ten blocks down. Five to go.
Oh wait! Stop! Stop! Stop!
Oh I'm sorry! Do you need a break?
My boots in tan! Hey! Can you get a little closer so I can see the price?
I can see it from right here. It'll cost you one husband.
Okay, I'm sorry. I think I can walk the rest of the way now. Just-just give me my boots.
I don't have your boots.
Well I don't have them either. Where are they?
Well, why don't you check in one of my saddlebags while I chew on a bale of hay!
Okay. God well, we gotta go back and get them!
Honey, are you seriously ever gonna wear the boots again?
Okay, I'm never gonna wear them again. I just didn't get a chance to say goodbye.
Y'know what? You can say goodbye to the tan ones.
Okay. All right.
Okay.
Bye boots-Wait! Half off?!
Joey, just because they're not getting married doesn't mean this is going to be a disaster. Maybe they have a plan!
Oh? Oh! Okay! Okay! Let's hear their plan! Now, what's the future look like for Dina and Bobby?
Well...I really have high hopes for my band.
You were right. He is funny.
Hey, now wait a minute! I get when you told people at first that you wanted to be an actor they laughed at you! Now come on Bobby, why don't you tell us a little bit about your band?
Well it's just me and my pal Rooster, the band's name is Numb Nuts.
Really?
Dina, if you're having a baby you should be married! Even if it is to Bobby! Dude, that's not a compliment!
No Joey! I knew you wouldn't be supportive!
So whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! What are you gonna do? You're gonna have the baby and-and raise it by yourself...without a husband?! You can't be a single mother alone! You're gonna ruin your life!
Oh excuse me! Am I ruining my life?
No! No! No! It's different for you. You're so strong and together. You're not some dumb kid who doesn't know what she's doing.
Excuse me?
One pregnant woman at a time, please! I just want you to be okay.
So forcing her to marry Bobby is gonna make that happen?
Maybe! Well! Well...so-so uh, what kind of music does Numb Nuts-Oh forget it! I can't!
Joey, I am scared to death about this. But I really think I can do it, I'm just gonna need some help. And Bobby's gonna be here the whole time.
You bet I am! And to answer your earlier question, we're straight-up gangster rap.
Look, Rachel's told me how much easier you've made all this on her. Why can't you do that for me?
Because! 'Cause... 'Cause you're my baby sister!
And you're my big brother! I mean, you're my favorite guy in the whole world. I'm not even scared to tell mom and dad. I was scared of telling you.
Well I'd be scared of them, but all right.
Joey, I can't stand the thought of having this baby with you mad at me. I want him to have his uncle. Is my baby gonna have his Uncle Joey?
Of course he's gonna have his Uncle Joey!
We're gonna be all right. I mean, even if we're not married this baby is gonna be so loved. Not just by us.
That's right! By his uncle too!
And by you.
Okay Bobby, why don't we just come over here and let them have a little moment.
Come here!
No! Seriously! What's wrong with you?!
You're gonna love me so much. I got Sting tickets!!
Oh my God! I do love you! How did you do it?!
Well...let's just say... Rosss caaaaan!
Oo, where are the seats?
Uh, middle balcony.
Okay, now would you say that that's more than 50 yards away from Sting, his wife, or a member of his family?
Yeah.
Then that's not breaking the law! I'm there!
Yeah?
Look at that guy by the window, wow!
He's awfully short and I think he's talking to himself. And to be completely honest, he's not that good in bed.
Oh, what is wrong with me lately? I mean it's like every guy I see-I mean look here. Look at that guy for example, I mean normally that's not someone I would-would be attracted to, but right now, with the way I'm feeling, all I want to do is rip off his sweatpants and fanny pack.
Wait a second! This is about the fourth month of your pregnancy, right?
Yeah.
This is completely normal, around the fourth month your hormones start going crazy.
Really?! So this has happened to you?
Oh absolutely yeah! Oh and keep in mind, now, I was carrying triplets so in, y'know, medical terms I was-I was thrice as randy.
Wow! This explains so much! Last weekend, I went from store to store sitting on Santa's lap.
Yeah. Yeah, I remember trying to steal a cardboard cutout of Evander Holyfield from a Foot Locker.
Ah.
Yeah.
Well, y'know what? I go see my doctor tomorrow, I'll ask her about this. Maybe she can give me a pill or something.
Yeah. Yeah, that's what you need a good...pill.
Hey! Hey!
Hi!
Hi! Look! I got our pictures developed from Rockefeller Center.
Oh great! Hey-hey Joey, do you want to check out pictures of me and Mona ice skating?
Oh uh, ordinarily I would love too, but I am just swamped right now.
Hey where-where are the pictures that creepy pretzel vendor took of us together?
Oh yeah, probably at the end. Oh my God! He only took pictures of my breasts!
I'm missin' picture time?!
Y'know she has a face Ross!
Okay. Okay, here's a good one of us.
Wow! That is a good one! Wow, it looks like a, like a holiday card y'know, with the tree in the middle and the skaters and the snow.
Y'know, every year I say I'm gonna send out holiday cards and I never do it. Do you wanna, do you wanna send this one out together?
Together? Like-like to people?
Yeah, y'know. Happy holidays from Mona and Ross. It'll be cute, okay?
Okay.
Oh, I gotta get to work. So call me later?
Uh sure, sure.
Bye guys.
Bye.
Congratulations! You just got married!
I know. Can you believe that?
Wait, I'm-I'm sorry. What's the big deal about a holiday card?
Married couples send out cards, families send out cards, people who have been dating for a couple of months do not send out cards! What-what is she crazy?!
Hey-hey-hey, hey that's your wife you're talking about!
Bing! Ho! And the Bing-ette!
Honey, you remember my boss Doug right?
Yes, hi.
Hi. So good news, the divorce is final. I signed the papers this A.M.
I didn't know you and Carol were getting divorced, I'm sorry.
Sorry? Finally chewed my leg out of that bear trap. Hey, congratulations to you guys though!
No leg-chewing for us sir.
Oh well, give it time. So the divorce, the marriage, we've got a lot to celebrate. How about we all go out to dinner tomorrow night?
I can't think of anything we're doing. Why can't I think of anything we're doing?
Tomorrow night it is then, I should be out of court by six. They keep throwing these sexual harassment cases at me and I keep knocking them out of the park!
Okay, I'll see you tomorrow! Just so you know, we're not seeing him tomorrow. I-I cannot spend another evening with that man. Do you remember how he behaved at our wedding?
No.
That's because he wasn't invited because of the way he behaved at our engagement party.
Oh yeah. Boy, urine cuts right through an ice sculpture doesn't it?
Hi!
Hey!
Hey, I went by the photo shop, take a look, here is a mockup of our card. What do you think?
Huh. Wow, this is great.
Now, do you think it should say, "Love Ross and Mona?"
Well, we-we haven't said that to each other yet, but I guess its okay to say it to other people.
How many did you want? I'm getting a hundred.
A hundred?! Well, I-I guess I'll take a-Mona, uh...I-I'm not sure about the whole uh, card thing.
Really? Why not?
Sending out a holiday card, together, I mean I just don't know if we're really quite there yet.
Oh y'know, I didn't think of it that way. You're right. You're right. So, can I ask you a question?
Yeah.
Where are we?
Huh.
Y'know, like where are we? Where is this relationship going?
Hmm...
I mean I love spending time with you, y'know I just-I hope we're moving forward. I mean, we should probably talk about that. Don't you think?
Let's do the card!
What?
The card! I think we're there!
Okay. I-But I think we should still have this conversation.
Really?! I mean, even with the card?
Hi!
Hi!
Just so you know, Dr. Long can't be here today, she was called to the hospital, so Dr. Schiff will be seeing you.
Oh, okay. Hey, can I ask you a question? Was it me, or-or was the guy who took my blood sample really cute? Y'know who I'm talking about, bald haircut, hairy fingers...
Hi Rachel? I'm Dr. Schiff.
Yes, you are.
So, how's it going?
Oh, really, really good. But enough about me, come on! Where-where are you from? What do you do?
I'm a doctor.
Right! Right! I-I actually meant in your spare time, do you cook? Do you ski? Or do you just hang out with your wife or girlfriend?
Uh, I don't have a wife or girlfriend, but I do like to ski.
Oh, I love to ski! How amazing is this?!
So, are you experiencing any discomfort?
No. I'm very comfortable.
Any painful gas?
No! Shoot, Dr. Schiff what kind of question is that?!
Okay then, would you like to lie down on the table?
Well would you like me to lie down on the table?
I'm sorry, is there something going on here?
Do you feel it too?
Hi.
Oh hey! So, how did your doctor's appointment go?
Well, let's see. Uh, they gave me cute doctor today and in the middle of the exam I put my pinky in his chin dimple.
Oh my God.
Why did you do that?
Okay, remember that little problem I was having during my fourth month of pregnancy?
Oh yeah, the Evander Holyfield phase. Oh man you were so hard up you practically came on to me.
You wish.
Hey, I could've had you if I wanted you.
Oh yeah? Come and get it.
Okay, even this is turning me on!
Hey!
Oh hey! Hey Ross! Hey how's it, how's it going with you and Mona? Are you guys still together?
Oh yeah, yeah we're moving forward. You'll be getting our card!
You and Mona are doing a holiday card together?
Yeah, we're not just doing a card! Y'know, she-she also wants to have the conversation about where the relationship is going.
Ugh! Women!
I know! I know! Why do you guys need to have this conversation?! Huh? I mean no self-respecting man would ask a woman, "So, where is this going?"
Uh Ross? You asked me that.
Hey! You were a closed book! Okay? I'm not a mind reader! Besides, I hate those conversations. I'm horrible at them. Really! Maybe-maybe I need kind of a gesture. Y'know, something that says we're moving forward without having to talk about it.
Like asking her to move in with you?
Smaller than that.
Making her a mixed tape?
Uh, bigger than that.
Give her a key to your apartment.
Whoa-hello! We were closer with the mixed tape.
All right. Have you said, "I love you?" You could say, I love you.
Yeah I-I don't-I don't think I'm quite there yet, but I could say I looove spending time with you.
No, we hate that.
That is a slap in the face.
Forget it. I-I-Y'know what? I'll just have the conversation. I'll just say I like things the way they are, and hope for the best. What do you think Rach?
I think, if it was a little colder in here I could see your nipples through that sweater.
Bing! We're all set for tonight, 8 o'clock.
Oh uh, as it turns out, we can't do it. Monica has to work.
Oh, my ex-wife didn't work, unless you call turning into her mother work. Fine. Tomorrow night then.
Oh uh well tomorrow's no good for her either.
Oh? Why not?
It's the semi-finals...of her...botchy ball tournament.
What's going on Bing? Does uh, your wife have a problem with me or something?
Well now-now you're just talking crazy.
So why can't the three of us go out together?
Because uh...we-we...we split up. Monica and I split up. Hold me.
Good God Bing I...well I can't say I'm altogether surprised, I saw the way she looked at you, and there was no love there. And the way she looked at me, pure lust.
Y'know what would really help me through this tough time is choking something. Can I choke ya?
Bing my boy, we're gonna get you over this. Now here's the plan, grab your coat, we're going to a strip club.
Oh no-no-no, Monica would freak. But to hell with that bitch.
Here we go. Mona umm, I think it's time we-we had a conversation about-about where things are with us.
Yeah, I-I think I suggested that.
Aw, we-we are so... So umm, well I-I-I like you and I-I love umm, y'know hanging out with you. And I mean-I'm having a lot of fun.
Okay.
I mean, there's no point in spending time with someone if-if it's just fun. It's gotta be, it's gotta be going somewhere right? So where-where is it going? Ah! That's-that's the real question. And-and the answer is...is it's going somewhere...fun. Now I-I know what you're thinking, fun was fine for you like ten years ago y'know, but you're-you're not getting any younger. No I mean-No not you, not you, you-you are getting younger. I mean-you-you look like you're getting younger by the second-What's your secret?
I'm sorry, so umm, so where are we?
Well, well to sum up, we're having fun, you look young.
Okay...
But that's not enough. So... So...here's a key to my apartment.
Really?!
Really.
You don't think this is too fast.
You gave her a key to your apartment?!
Not just a key, I gave her the only key! I am now a homeless person in a very serious relationship.
Hey. Ooh Ross! How'd the conversation go?
Oh great, I live on the street.
Where?!
Hey!
Hi! Okay, Monica, Rachel, this is my friend Roger.
Hey everybody.
Hi Roger.
So umm, I'm gonna get us some drinks. Would you help me out?
Yeah.
Umm, he's here to have sex with you.
What?
You're welcome.
Phoebe no!
It's okay, he's a virgin.
Rachel umm, I was just talking to this guy and I think he'll have sex with you.
Yeah, okay let's leave these two alone.
No! I do not care what my hormones are doing, I am not going to just do it with some random guy!
Fine! Then you tell Roger because he was really looking forward to this!
Oh Bing, look at those twin sisters dancing together. Let me buy you a lap dance with those girls. Huh?
Oh that's all right sir, and that's just one girl.
Bing-What's this?!
It's a hand. It's a thing you use as a Jack and Coke holder.
No, it's a wedding ring. You gotta get rid of it. We're gonna go to the East River right now and throw it in there!
Oh no-no-no!
Oh yeah-yeah-yeah, y'know I did it and I felt a hell of a lot better and if you whip it just right you might hit a seagull in the head.
Okay, and oh I'm gonna need a bunch of extra keys. Apparently I give them away for no reason at all.
Hey Ross, what's going on? You changing the lock?
No. That guy is.
I don't understand. You-you give me a key to your apartment and then you change the lock.
Good luck buddy.
Umm, I-I thought we were moving forward and now you're-you're sending me all these mixed signals. What are you trying to tell me?
I'm trying to tell you I made you a mix tape.
What?
I love you!
Ohh! And I love spending time with you.
Hi honey I'm home.
From the tequila factory?
It was awful. To get out of going to dinner with Doug I told him that you and I split up. So then he took me to all these strip clubs and sleazy bars, and then when I wouldn't give him my wedding ring, he threw a soda can at a bird!
Come here. I can breath through my mouth.
Y'know what the worse part was? I got to see what my life would be like without you. It was like It's a Wonderful Life with lap dances. Please promise that you will never leave me, that we will grow old together, and be with each other for the rest of our lives.
I promise. Hey, speaking of together, how about we send out a holiday card this year?
Ooh, I don't know if we're there yet.
Yes. Hi, I'd like to order a pizza. Okay, can I ask you a question? Is-is the cute blond guy delivering tonight? Very Ambercrombie & Fitch. I'll call you back.
Who was that?
It's just the pizza place.
You hung up on the pizza place? I don't hang up on your friends.
I'm sorry honey, I'm just having a, having a rough day.
Oh, what's wrong?
Oh you really, you really just don't want to hear about it.
Then why did I ask?
Okay, it's just-and this is really embarrassing-but lately with this whole pregnancy thing I'm just finding myself...how do I put this umm, erotically charged.
Is that college talk for horny?
Yeah. So y'know, I have all of these feelings and I don't know what to do about them, because I can't date like a normal person, which is fine because I don't need a relationship, I mean all I really want is one great night. Just sex, y'know? No strings attached, no relationship, just with someone that I feel comfortable with and who knows what he's doing. For just one great night, I mean is that really so...hard...to find. So how was your day?
Good, I uh, I saw a pretty big pigeon.
Well, I gotta get up early and it's almost seven o'clock.
Yeah, I gotta, I gotta go to my room too.
Okay, good night!
Good night.
I can't do it!
I didn't ask you to do it!
You're Rachel!
You're Joey!
You're my friend!
Right back at ya!
But plus, it would be wrong and weird and-and-and bad.
And so bad. I don't even know what you're talking about because I didn't ask you to do anything!
I know!
Do you wanna do it?
No!
All right, me neither! I was just testing you!
That's the end of this conversation!
This conversation never happened!
Never happened! Good night!
Good night!
Get back in there!
Hi. Listen, I'm sorry about that whole thing with Roger. It really wasn't right, and I, and I want to make it up to you, so umm, I brought you something that I think you'll really enjoy. Now, this is just a loan. Okay? I'm gonna, I'm gonna want him back. So... I'm gonna go now. I'm sorry, I thought I could do it and I can't!
Hey! I got you a present!!
Oh my goodness! Where did you hide it?
I got it for your wedding and I ordered it weeks ago, and it finally got here!
Pheebs you didn't have to get us anything for our wedding you already sang...
I love it! It's huge!! Let's open it! Open it!!
It's a Ms. Pac-Man machine!!
Oh my God!
I didn't know where to put it so I just left it here for now.
Oh well, maybe we can put it in the guest bedroom.
Oh, okay.
All right.
I kinda like it here.
Do you really like it?
Are you kidding?! I practically spent my entire childhood at the arcade! This is like-Oh my, this is like my second favorite game!
Oh really? What was your first?
Well I-I really don't remember the name of it.
Well what did it do?
Well, you just-you put a quarter in and y'know pull-pull some handles and win like a candy bar or something.
A vending machine?
Don't feel bad for me! I won like every time!
Hey! Oh, I'm so glad you guys are here. I've been dying to tell someone what happened in the Paleontology department today.
Do you think he saw us or can we still sneak out?
Professor Neuman, the head of the department, so....
They made you head of the department!
No, I get to teach one of his advanced classes! Why didn't I get head of the department?
Oh! Hey Rach, listen umm...
Yeah.
I got a big date coming up, do you know a good restaurant?
Uh, Paul's Caf. They got great food and it's really romantic.
Ooh, great! Thanks!
Yeah! Oh, and then afterwards you can take her to the Four Seasons for drinks. Or you go downtown and listen to some jazz. Or dancing-Oh! Take her dancing!
You sure are naming a lot of ways to postpone sex, I'll tell ya...
Ooh, I miss dating. Gettin' all dressed up and going to a fancy restaurant. I'm not gonna be able to do that for so long, and it's so much fun! I mean not that sitting at home worrying about giving birth to a sixteen pound baby is not fun.
Hey, y'know what?
Huh?
Why don't I take you out?
What?! Joey, you don't want to go on a date with a pregnant lady.
Yes I do! And we're gonna go out, we're gonna have a good time, and take your mind off of childbirth and c-sections and-and giant baby heads stretching out...
Okay! I'll go with ya! I'll go! I'll go with ya.
I'll be fun.
All right?
No. No! Yes! Ahh. Oh, would you look at that Monica? I just knocked off all of your top scores, how sad.
Okay, I'm next. Don't! Don't start another game! I said I'm next! Phoebe!
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't hear you over all the winning.
Chandler! Phoebe's hogging the game!
Who cares? It's a stupid game.
You only think it's stupid because you suck at it.
I don't suck. It's sucks. You suck.
Wait okay, if this game is gonna cause problems between the two of you, then maybe I should just keep it.
No! No-no! I love it! It is a great present! In fact, why don't you go home and wait for the thank you card?
Why do you want to play this game so bad?
Yeah! It's not like it spits out a Clark bar after every game.
Okay. Phoebe that's it. Come on, get out-out of the chair. Get out! Oh come...Phoebe!
Joey? Could you get that? What are you doing here? I thought you were in your room?
No, I'm picking you up for our date. These are for you.
Ohh, Lilies. Joey, they're my favorite. Thank you.
And, a brownie! Well, half a brownie. Actually, it's just bag. It's been a long walk from the flower shop and I was startin' to feel faint so...
Oh man! This is so great! I actually feel like I'm going on a real date! Although, I have a hint of morning sickness, and I'm wearing underwear that goes up to about......there.
Hey come on now, this is a real date. Uh, so...nice place you got here. Foosball, huh? Pizza box. Oh, a subscription to Playboy, my kind of woman.
Yeah, actually that's my roommate's.
I would like to meet him. He sounds like a stand up guy.
Ah yes, but he's very protective of me so you'd better watch yourself.
Ah... Hey, so this roommate of yours...is he good looking?
Hm-mmm.
Oh yeah, it must be tough to keep your hands of him, huh?
Yeah, but I'm pretty sure he's gay.
No-no-no-no, he's not! No! Why are you trying to ruin the game? Come on!
...which brings us back, of course, to Greely's theory of dominance. Okay, that-that's all for today. Oh, uh does anyone know where the Freeman building is?
Yeah, it's the new building on Avenue A.
What?! That-that's all the way cross town, I'm supposed to teach a graduate seminar there in ten minutes.
Ooh, dude. That's not gonna happen.
Move it! Move it! Move it!! Hey!!! I'm the teacher!!
Hello. I'm sorry I'm a little late. Ah--Whoa! A lot late. Let me start by uh, by introducing myself, I am Professor Geller. So to sum up, I'm Professor Geller. Good job today.
Now the filet mignon, what comes with that?
There's a side of steamed vegetables.
Emmm. Now, instead of the vegetables, is there anyway I can substitute the three-pound lobster?
Y'know what? Bring her both, and I'll have the same.
Wow! This is shaping up to be a pretty good date-Oh, I almost forgot. I didn't pay you the rent check.
Oh whoa-whoa-whoa, no roommate stuff. Okay? We're on a date.
Okay. Wow! So I get to see what Joey Tribbiani is like on a date. So do you have any moves?
No! No. Umm, just myself and if they don't like me for- I'm sorry I couldn't even get through that.
I knew it! I knew it. Come on tell me your moves.
Oh alright. Umm, well, okay, I usually start by having a bottle of wine sent to my table from a fan.
Oh my God. And that works?!
Well it does when you combine it with, "This is so embarrassing, I just want to have a normal life!"
Oh, you poor little famous man.
Oh okay, how about this one. I was gonna wait until the end of the night to kiss you, but you're so beautiful...I don't think I can.
Oh my God! Wow! That was fantastic, I almost leaned in. I really almost did!
Alright, so...so tell me one of your moves.
Alright. So where'd you grow up?
That's your move? Boy Rach, you're lucky you're hot.
Come on, just answer the question!
Queens.
And so were-were you close to your parents?
Yeah, with my mom. Yeah, not so much with my dad.
Why not?
I don't know. I guess there's just always been this distance y'know-I mean we both try to pretend it's not there, but it is.
Oh. It's gotta be rough.
Yeah, it is. It's really tough. Y'know sometimes I think-Wow!! Nice move!
Huh?
"Where'd you grow up," it's so simple!
Thank you! And now if you'll excuse me, I have to go to the rest room.
Yeah.
And now you're watching me walk away.
Yes I am! Again so simple!
Hey.
You are not going to believe what I did today!
Well it clearly wasn't showering or shaving.
I got good. I played this game all day and now I rule at it! They should change the name of it to Ms. Chandler. Although I-I hope they don't.
Wait a minute, you stayed home all day and played Ms. Pac-Man while I went off to work like some kind of chump?!
Uh-huh, and I got all the top ten scores, I erased Phoebe off the board! High five!
What is the matter with your hand?
Well I've been playing it for like eight hours, it'll loosen up. Come on, check out the scores. Oh, and also look at the initials, they're dirty words.
Chandler, why would you do that?
Because it's awesome.
You think this is clever?
Well y'know, they only give you three letters, so after A-S-S it is a bit of a challenge.
Hey wait a minute, this one isn't dirty.
It is when you put it together with that one.
Ah, well if you don't clear this off, you won't be getting one of those from me. But Ben's coming over here tomorrow to play this game, this can't be there.
Come on, he won't even know what they mean.
Chandler! He's seven; he's not stupid.
Have you talked to him lately?
All right, look I'm just gonna unplug it.
No-no-no, if you unplug it, I'll have nothing to show for my day! It would be like I was at work. No! Hey look at that! Look at that, it's still there! This thing must have some kind of primitive ROM Chip in it or something!
Honey you-you got to beat your scores!
With the claw?!
All right fine. Fine, I'll do it. I've just got to get this off the screen. Carol and Susan are still upset that you taught him pull my finger.
Pull my finger--My hand is messed up.
I am not gonna answer that!
Oh come on! Just pick one! Between Monica, Phoebe, Chandler, and Ross if you had to, if you had to, who would you punch?
No one! They are my friends, I wouldn't punch any of them.
Chandler?
Yeah, but I don't know why. Look at me, I'm having such a wonderful time!
Me too! Hey Rach, can I just say I think this is the best date I ever had!
I know!
I never laughed so hard-Did you see the wine come out of my nose?
Joey, I think everyone saw the wine come out of your nose.
I gotta say, I never knew I could enjoy the non-sex part of the date so much.
Well that is because you have never been on a date with me before.
Huh. Huh.
All right, now don't judge me. I normally wait until my date leaves, but you live here. I'm ripping into this swan.
Ah! Okay, well then you don't judge me. I'm gonna suck on the cellophane from the brownie I had before.
So tell me, what are Joey Tribbiani's end of the night moves?
Ah, well, if I want the girl to kiss me, first thing I do is make my lips look irresistible.
How do you do that?
Now you can't tell anyone, but uh...I put on shiny lip balm.
Oh my God!
Yeah, like a moth to a flame, I'm telling ya. Okay all right, so now you go.
No, I don't want to tell you.
Why not?
Because it's embarrassing.
More embarrassing than shiny raspberry lip balm?! I didn't say raspberry before did I? All right just-just tell me Rach, just tell me!
Okay. All right, stand up. Well, when we're at the door, I lightly press my lips against his, and then move into his body just for a second, and then I make this sound, "Hmmm." Okay, I know it doesn't sound like anything, but I swear it works.
Yeah. Why-Yeah, that would work for ya...
All right, I gotta go to bed. Honey, I had such a wonderful time.
Oh. Yeah. Me to.
...you were 50 minutes late to the class, what did you crawl there?!
No, I ran. It was really far, and when did people stop understanding the phrase, "Get the hell out of my way!"
Well, why didn't you just take a cab?
Ugh, between the traffic that time of day and all the one-way streets it'll take me twice as long. Besides, I teach the class three times a week, who am I? Rockefeller?
Well you're not gonna be able to keep doing this.
Well I have to. Okay? If I don't, they'll take the class away from me. And...I already put it in my family newsletter.
You what?
You've seen it, the Geller Yeller.
Right. Wow!
Besides, I-I think I figured out a much faster route, I'm sure I can make it this time. I just...I just can't be afraid to get a little bit...hit by cars.
Hey!
Hi! Hey, remember how last night we were talking about that movie Cujo?
Oh yeah, I still can't believe you haven't seen Cujo. What is wrong with you?
Relax! It's not like it's Citizen Kane!
Have you ever tried to sit through Citizen Kane?
Yeah I know it's really boring, but it's like a big deal. Anyway, I was thinking about renting Cujo sometime.
Oh yeah? All right, let's do it tonight.
Well don't you have that big date tonight?
Oh right!
Hey Joey, can I ask you something?
Yeah.
After our date last night, did you feel a little weird?
Oh my God! You did too? It totally freaked me out, what was that?!
I don't know! I'm-I'm kinda thinking it-it was the lobster...
Oh yeah-yeah, the lobster.
Yeah, I mean I was up sick all night.
Yeah me too, all night.
Really?! How come we didn't cross paths?
Yeah well that's because uh...I stayed in my room. Yeah, you don't want to look in my hamper.
Okay, I got that. I'll escape over there. I'll come back over here. All right, come on Ms. Pac-Man. It's got-Right- Well, you're just a little bitch, aren't you?
Hey, you guys. Listen, I'm sorry that I was hogging the game before--Oh my God! Your friends have some unfortunate initials!
They're all Chandler.
Chandler sucks! He couldn't have gotten this good!
I did. But it came at a price.
But Ben is coming over tonight and he can't see this.
Oh come on, by age seven kids have already seen orgies. Was it just me?!
Yeah!!!! Yes, I made it! I'm on time! Okay, why don't we all uh, open our books to page 23. Where... Where you will see...a uh...a bunch of uh...red spots. Okay, umm, why don't, why don't you all start to read, while I-
Hey. Are you all right? You seem a little distracted.
No-no! I'm fine. It's just... Hey, can I ask you something? Have you ever looked at someone that you've known for a while and then suddenly...suddenly see them a different way?
You mean like from behind?
Yeah. Yeah, that...that's exactly it. You're right. Yeah.
Ew, y'know what? One time I saw this guy from behind and he seemed like a totally normal guy and then he turned around and it was Stephan Baldwin!
Ooh! Yeah. So yeah, so you know exactly what I'm talking about.
Totally! Wow! Would you excuse me for a sec?
Oh yeah, sure. Ehhh.
Oh my God Phoebe, you're on fire!
I know!
One more score to go! You can do it!
Don't touch me!!
Don't touch her!!
All right! Go left! Go left! Go right!! Go right!!
I can't!! I can't!! Noooooooo!!!!!!! You son of a bitch!!!!!
Phoebe!!
Oh hi Ben-No!! Don't look at the machine!
Oh God! Thank God you're home! I'm watching Cujo.
Alone?!
Yes! But what is wrong with this dog?!
Hey, did you get to the part where they're trapped in the car and Cujo's throwin' himself at the windshield?
No! No! Seriously, what's wrong with the dog?! Wait a minute, what are you doing home so early? What happened to your date?
Oh uh, it didn't work out.
Oh. Do you want to watch the rest of the movie with me?
Oh uh, okay. Yeah.
Y'know, I never thought I'd say this about a movie, but I really hope this dog dies. What are you doing over there? Come sit here, you protect me.
Oh sure, yeah, why not?
Okay. Okay, that's him! That's him! That's Cujo! That's Cujo!
All right, I know! I know. Yeah, it'll be okay.
Oh my God....What's he gonna do now? I can't watch! Oh. Seriously, how can you watch this? Aren't you scared?
Terrified.
So is everybody here? I got here a little early myself. Let us begin. Now, the hydrosaurids have been unearthed in two main locations. Here. Here. Now as for the hydrosaurs...
All right. It's a new day. All that stuff about Rachel, you don't feel that now. It was crazy! You're fine. You're better than fine! You are, as your friend Tony would say, Grrrreat! Everything's normal! She's just your friend Rachel! Your friend Rachel. Your friend! Rachel.
Hi, sweetie.
Hey, it's your girlfriend, Rachel!
Hi.
Are you, are you high?
I just had the most amazing bath.
Really? I don't like baths.
Wait, you like them with me.
Honey, it's not the bath I enjoy, it's the wet, naked lady.
Oh, baths are so relaxing!
Really? What do you do? You just sit in there stewing in your own filth.
How dirty do you think I am? I'm telling you, if you had some candles and some bubbles and some music, you would love it! It would take all of your stress away.
Honey, it's 2:00 on a Wednesday and I'm watching Road Rules, how stressed do you think I am?
Hey, Chandler, you got a minute? I-I really need to talk to you.
Oh! Uh, yeah! Is this a cold pizza talk or a leftover meatloaf talk?
Well, neither.
Oh my God, what's up?!
I don't know. It's-it's just...lately, I've been feeling... Okay, here's what it is... You know what? I feel a lot better, thanks!
Oh no-no, no you don't, just come back.
All right. Okay. You and Monica, friends for a long time, and sure there are rules, but then you went to London. Oh, no, but that's different. I mean, there are rules there, too! You know what I mean?
Do you?
It was different for you guys! I mean, I mean, you were both in the same place, right?
In London?
Yeah.
Yes. When Monica and I were in London, we were both in London.
You know what? This is a bad idea. Forget it. Forget it, and listen, do me a favor, this conversation was between you and me.
If that.
Hi! Oh, Ross, don't forget, we have that doctor's appointment tomorrow!
Right.
Hey, are you going to find out the sex of the baby?
No-no, we talked about it. We don't want to know. All we care about is that it's happy and healthy.
Yep! Happy and healthy! And cute!
And smart!
Popular.
With an aptitude for science.
Are you two talking about the same baby? Hey! Have you started off thinking of names yet?
Oh yeah! I've come up with a bunch of ideas!
Really? Me too!
Me too!
Really?!
Uh huh! If it's a girl, Phoebe, and if it's a boy, Phoebo!
Maybe. But it wouldn't hurt to have a backup, you know? Uh, Rach-Rach, what were you thinking?
Okay! I was thinking if it's a girl, how about Sandrine? It's French.
Huh. That's a really pretty name for-for an industrial solvent.
Okay fine, what do you have?
Well, OK, it's for a boy. Well, I know it's a little out there, but...Darwin.
Wow, oh my God, our child will be beaten to death in the schoolyard.
Yeah, by Sandrine.
You're just saying that 'cause I said no to your name!
I'm really, really not.
How-how about you each get five vetoes?
All right.
All right.
That sounds fair.
Yeah! I don't think you're going to need it though. Okay, check this out. If it's a girl, Rain.
Veto.
Why?
Rain? Hi. Hi, my name is Rain. I have my own kiln, and my dress is made out of wheat.
I know her! I bought homemade soap from her at a Dead show!
Okay, how about, for a guy, Thatcher?
Ross, why do you hate our child?
Fine, you go.
Okay, James.
Huh.
But only if it's a girl.
Oh, veto. How about-Ooh, I like Ruth! What about Ruth?
Oh! I'm sorry! Are we having an 89-year-old? How about Dayton?
Veto. Stewart?
Veto. Sawyer?
Veto. Helen?
Veto.
Is it me, or is veto starting to sound really good?
Hey.
Boy, do I have a surprise for you!
Sex on the balcony?
No, but someone's really not going to get over that idea, are they?
What is it?
I drew you a bath!
Honey, I don't like baths! Could you draw me a picture of us having sex on the balcony?
Please, could you just try it for me? Come on, I used all my best stuff! I-I-I lit some candles. I put on some music. I used bath salts, plus bubble bath! And got you this little plastic Navy ship. So it's a boy bath!
Well, this does butch it up a bit.
I swear, if you try it, you will love it!
All right, if I do this, can we at least discuss sex on the balcony?
Absolutely.
Bet I know how that discussion's going to go.
All right, this isn't so bad. I like the flower smell! Which is okay, because I've got my boat.
So?
Oh my God.
I told you you were a bath person! Hey, when you get out, maybe I can give you a facial!
I'm going to need a bigger boat.
I don't think you had an open mind about the name Ruth. I mean, come on, little Ruthie Geller, how-how cute is that?
Oh, oh my God! I can practically hear the mahjong tiles!
Okay! All your tests look fine. Now, are you two interested in knowing the sex of the baby?
Uh, no. No, we're not.
But you have it right there in that file? You could tell us whether it's a boy or a girl? Dayton or Sandrine? Phoebe or Phoebo?
That's right. But if you don't want to know...
No, no, we want to wait, right?
Right. Right.
Oh, I'll be right back. And, uh, I know it's really not my place, but please don't name your child Phoebo.
So, which of these babies do you think is the ugliest?
What? Rach! Come on, that's terrible! They're...uh...they're babies. They're-they're all beautiful.
Third one from the left?
Yeah, why is it staring at me? I think it knows I'm talking about it. Don't-don't you-Wh-Wha-Hey!!
What?!
You're looking!
I didn't!
I saw you!
Okay fine, I did. But I didn't see anything, I swear.
Shame on you! Ugly baby judges you!
Okay, but Ross just listen to me...
No, no, no, no! Don't tell me! I don't want to know!
But I couldn't even if I wanted to, because I don't know! I swear; I didn't see anything, and I don't want to know! It was just a momentary lapse.
Momentary lapse. Don't-don't you have any self-control?
Okay, a couple months late on the lecture, Ross.
Hello?
I'm in the bathroom, can you come in here? I think there's something wrong.
You know what? I-I think I'll wait out here.
I'm in the bathtub.
Oh. What's wrong?
I drew my own bath, but I did it wrong! The water's tepid. The salt didn't dissolve and is now... lodged places. And the scents I used don't compliment each other. Eucalyptus and chamomile-Oh!
What?
The bath salts! They're starting to effervesce! It's different. It's interesting.
Okay, let's talk about something else.
Yeah! Sure, sure. So, what was going on with you today? Oh-oh-oh!
Well, I actually had the weirdest conversation with Joey. He was talking about rules and right and wrong and...
I had the exact same conversation.
You did? What was he talking about?
I don't know! Joey hasn't had this much trouble getting out words since we saw him in Macbeth!
That was a long night.
All right, let's break this down. What exactly did he say to you?
Okay, he was talking about rules.
Uh-huh.
Umm, and looking at people differently.
He didn't say anything about that to me.
What did he tell you?
He was asking all these questions about you, me, and London. And, of course the glue that holds this all together, the rules.
Okay. So you, me and London. Looking at people differently. Maybe he wants to do what you and I did in London with someone.
But what did he mean by rules?
Wait a minute! He stopped talking the minute Phoebe came in!
Because he was looking at her differently.
And Phoebe is his friend, so he thinks that would be breaking the rules!
My God! He wants to do it with Phoebe in London!
You guys?
Just a minute! That's Mrs. Tribbiani!
You don't say anything.
Why would I say anything? That two of our best friends could start the greatest love affair of their lives! And they would have me to thank, and we could all start having babies?
I'm not going to let you say anything.
You just stay here!
Oh, God!
Oh, hey, Monica, I brought back your iron.
Oh, you had that?
Uh-huh.
I thought I lost it. I got a new one, like, a month ago.
Oh, just as well, I broke this one.
What?
Nothing.
Okay.
I mean, I-I, I really shouldn't say. I mean, I'm really not supposed to.
Fine.
It's a humdinger!
Then it's really too bad that you can't tell me.
Somebody likes you!
Is it Chandler?
No!
Well, then tell him to stop staring!
It's Joey!
Really?! Joey?! You don't say.
Is it something you'd be interested in?
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know. You know, I mean, on the one hand, Mother may I? But y'know on the other hand... No. No, I can't. We're friends. No, oh, no. I don't want to risk what we have.
I guess that makes sense. So, you think you're going to talk to him?
Sure, yeah. I mean, it's Joey. I don't want him to get hurt. Well, I must say, I am on fire! First Chandler, now Joey!
Not Chandler, just Joey.
Sure.
Hey.
Hey.
You know what? I've been thinking about it. I'm really coming around on the name Ruth. I think I would actually consider naming our child that.
Rach, I-I can't tell you how-how much that means to me! Ohh... Wait a minute. Wait a minute. You-you hated the name Ruth! Why-why would you change your mind? Unless, you know we're never going to have to use it. You did see the folder. You know it's a boy!
I didn't see anything! I actually changed my mind about the name.
I don't think so! You're just giving me Ruth so you'll get to name it when it's a boy, and that's when you'll swoop in and name him Heath or Blaine or Sequoia.
I would-Sequoia?
Veto.
Fine.
Unless... You anticipated that I would figure all this out and you know that it actually is a girl, and you really do want her to be named Ruth! Well, I'm not falling for that! Okay? Ruth is off the table!
But Ross, you want the name Ruth!
Not like this!
Hey.
Hey. Well, what's up?
Umm, Joey, I know.
What?
I knooow.
Whaaat?
I know about your feelings.
Oh my God. You do?
Yes, and I'm sorry. I-I know things worked out for Chandler and Monica, but that's very rare.
I know. I know. And this is so much more complicated than it was for those guys. I mean, it's Rachel for God sakes.
For God sakes, it's Rachel!
I know. I know. And she's not only my friend; she's my pregnant friend! She's my pregnant friend who's Ross' ex!
Yeah that's Rachel. Beat me over the head with it.
What am I going to do? You know, and I keep, I keep trying to get rid of these feelings, y'know? I stayed up all last night and made a list of everything I don't like about her. You want to hear it?
Yeah.
She made me switch to light Mayo. That's it! That's all I got! And, you know what? It tastes the same and my pants fit better!
Joey, I just think you're getting worked up over nothing. This is probably just a crush.
You think?
Absolutely! Y'know, you get this rush of feelings, but then it goes away.
Yeah, just a crush! That's all this is! It's a crush! I'm Joey; I don't get deep feelings.
That's right, there you go! Crushes happen all the time! I know I've had them for all you guys. Well, except for Ross and Chandler. And I'm sure you've had them for us.
Not really.
Mm-hmm. Throw me a bone here.
So, I uh... I called the doctor and now we both know the sex of the baby.
What?
That's right. The student has become the master.
Ross, I swear, I don't know.
Oh, come on, you know it's a girl!
A what?!
You really didn't know?
We're having a girl?
No.
That's what you just said!
No.
You said girl!
Yes. I'm... I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
I'm not! We're having a girl! Sometimes I can't believe it's with you-But still! We're having a girl!
I know! I know. You know what? I'm putting Ruth back on the table!
Oh, yes! We'll have ourselves a little baby Ruth...
Permission to veto.
Yes, please.
Hey.
Do I smell essential oils?
Yeah, I'm going to take a bath. I'm just going to get a magazine.
Okay.
What do you think you're doing?
L-leaving my troubles behind?
I know that you're new at this, but this is completely unacceptable bath decorum.
Oh, it's so hard to care when you're this relaxed.
Fine, you can have the bath, but I am taking your boat. Now you're just a girl in a tub!
Hey!
Hi, Bubbles. Manly. Well, I just thought I would drop by and let you know how it went with Joey.
You told her?!
She pulled it out of me! She's like a conversational wizard! How'd it go?
Well, you were wrong, he doesn't like me!
What?
Yeah! How would you like it if I sent you to Lee Majors' house and told you that he liked you, and you went down there and you found out that he didn't like you? How would you feel?
I don't think I'd care.
Really? Lee Majors is hot!
Hello?
We're in the bathroom!
Why?
Because it's a relaxing and enjoyable time!
What are you guys doing in here?
Oh my God! A friend he's looking at differently, but it's wrong. It's Rachel!
You like Rachel?!
It's no big deal, okay? Phoebe and I talked about it. It's just a crush! It's going to go away! Dude, you gotta rearrange your bubbles! Oh!
Mazel tov.
Hey! Ross and I were looking for you! What are we all doing in here? Oh, my!
Honey, cover it up with the boat!
Hello?
Yes we're all in here and we would love for you to join us!
Well hey! What's going on? Ooh, cool boat--Oh, no. Hey, did you, did you tell them?
No, I was waiting for you!
Tell us what?
We're having a girl.
Oh, wow! Yay! Wow! Hooray! Oh, man!
I'll...I'll get you later!
All right. It's a new day, and it's just a crush, that's all! Just a little crush! All that worrying I was doing, that was crazy. Crazy! Like my friend here the bird would say, "it was cuckoo!" Everything's going to be fine. It's just a crush.
Hi, sweetie.
I love you.
It sure is nice to do this together, isn't it?
Yeah. And what you're doing feels so good.
I'm not touching you.
You're not?
It's the salts.
Oh, sweet Lord. New realms of pleasure!
Whatever keeps you off the balcony, big guy!
Hey, what's up?
Well, I left my guitar here again.
Oh, okay. No problem.
Okay.
Okay.
Oh.
Here you go.
Okay.
Okay.
Great! Umm...
What?!
So do you want to hang out or something?
Phoebe! You kinda caught me at a bad time.
Oh are you and Chandler...
Yes! Exactly.
Okay. Do you guys want me to play for you?
No.
Hey Pheebs, what's up?
You ask an intriguing question Chandler Bing.
Oh my God! You're getting a massage! You never let me massage you!!
Phoebe, I can explain!
You told me you hate massages!
Buy stamps, pick up dry cleaning...Don't let Phoebe in.
I can't believe this! How long as this been going on?
Well umm, Alexandra has been...
Oh, it has a name?
Phoebe, don't get upset!
Okay-Oop! Too late! I'm leaving! Come on Chandler let's go!
Well, Phoebe I thought I'd--Yeah, what the hell.
Oh okay, okay! One more push! One more push! Come on honey, we're almost there! We're almost there!
Oh Joey, I'm so happy things worked out for us that we're having this baby together. I love you so much.
Oh, I love you too.
And I hope it's not an inappropriate time to say this but, you're the best sex I ever had.
That's always appropriate! Oh, okay. One more push! One more push!
Oh, here is your beautiful baby. Congratulations!
I hope you're a better father than you're a friend!!
Joey! Joey!
What? What's going on?
Come feel this! Come feel my belly!
Aaaah...
Joey! The baby is kicking for the first time! Will you please come feel this?!
Really?!
Yes!
Oh, y'know what? Maybe uh, you...you should come to me. I'm a not, I'm not wearing any bottoms.
Oh, okay!
Oh my, oh my God!
Aw, it's unbelievable! Wow! She is kicking so much! Oh, she's like umm...oh...who's that kind of annoying girl soccer player?
Mia Hamm?
Mia Hamm!
Oh that's amazing.
Oh-oh!! One hand on the sheet Joe!
Whoa-hey-oh! Sorry!
Hey babe.
Hi honey. We just got a wedding gift from Bob and Faye Bing; they don't like us do they?
Who says you can't get a nice punch bowl for under six bucks? Maybe we can take it back?
No, it doesn't say where it came from. Where would we return it?
How about to the street say from the balcony?
Why don't we just find a place for it?
Okay. How about in that cabinet?
No! That's where we keep the canned goods! Have you completely forgotten everything you learned at orientation?
How about the closet by the bathroom?
Oh, okay. Here, why don't you let me do it?
Oh no-no-no, I will do it. Honey, you have to learn to sit down and relax and let your husband take care of things once and awhile. It's locked, you have to help me. Why is it locked?
No reason. I-I keep private things in there.
Oh y'know, I've been living here a while and I've never seen what's inside that closet. What is, what is in there?
Feminine stuff.
Don't try to make me uncomfortable with feminine stuff!
Chandler, there is nothing in there that concerns you! If you love me you-you'll let it go.
Fine.
Thank you!
Love you.
Hello Chandler, lovely day huh? You!
Phoebe if it helps Alexandra has only been massaging Monica for like three years. If! I said, "If it helps!"
Why won't you let me massage you?
Well it's...I mean I'd just-I'd be self-conscious. You're my friend; I'd be naked.
Monica! We lived together for years! I've seen you naked!
That's different, we were roommates! And when?!
I'm curious about the human body.
Hey, come on Phoebe, you can understand why this would be weird for me.
But I'm a professional! And I'm really good! Look, if you're uncomfortable we can stop. Just give me a chance, okay. Please?
Okay, if it means that much to you...
It does! How would you feel if you couldn't share your cooking? Or-or imagine how Ross would feel if he couldn't teach us about dragons.
Dinosaurs.
Potato, potaato.
Hey!
Hey Ross! The baby's kicking!
What?! It is?!
It's not kicking right now. Although we would love to see you do that again.
Hey, when-when was it kicking? What happened?
Last night! I just felt it and I went into Joey's room and he was sleeping...
A dreamless sleep.
My God, the baby's kicking. That's great. Although I...kinda wish I-I would've been there to feel the kicking for the first time y'know.
Well I got stuff going on in here if you wanna feel.
Look, I-I don't want to miss anymore baby stuff. So...Here. Here's my new pager number, okay? Anytime anything pregnancy related happens use it! I'll be there! Okay? I don't care if it's three in the morning and all you want is ice cream.
Wow! Can I get a copy of that?
Are you under the sheet?
Yes.
Great, let's begin. How's the pressure?
Nice! Wow Phoebe you are good!
Stating the obvious, but thank you. And it's not weird is it.
No. Ooohh...
That's right, you just enjoy.
Oh. Oh yeah! Ohhhhh! Ohh! Oh yeah!
Okay.
Oh God Phoebe!! Oh that's it! That's it! Right there! Oh! Ooooh-oooh-ooooh...
I wasn't trying to open your closet! I wasn't trying to open your closet! I swear!
Whoa, Monica runs a pretty tight ship over here. What are you doing?
Monica has a secret closet and she won't let me see what's in it.
Why not?
I don't know! What could she possibly be hiding in here that I can't see?!
I don't know. Ooh, I bet it's Richard.
Why would Monica be keeping Richard in here?
Well off the top of my head uhh, maybe she's having her cake and eating it too. You being the cake and Richard being the too. Or!
And here we go...
I saw this movie once where there was a door and no one knew what was behind it, and when they finally got it open millions and millions and millions of bugs came pouring out and they feasted on human flesh. Y'know it wouldn't kill ya to respect your wife's privacy! Stupid closet full of bugs!
Joey. Joey, something feels weird and not good weird. I don't-Whoa!!
Oh hey whoa-whoa, don't worry. Okay. When my sisters were pregnant they got every weird feeling in the book, it was always nothing.
Really?
Absolutely. But, we're gonna stop by the hospital just to be sure, okay? I'll page Ross on the way. Come on.
Okay. Oh God-Ow!-Oo!
Okay Rach-Rach-Rach look at me, look at me, everything's gonna be fine, trust me. Okay. Take my hand. Here we go. Oww crushing bones!
Hey! So?
She's fine. She's experiencing Braxton-Hicks contractions, mild discomfort caused by contractions in the uterine wall.
Hmm, mild discomfort. So I take it you've had one of these Braxton thingies?
So but everything is normal.
Absolutely.
And-and there's no danger to her and the baby?
No-no. Contractions can be unnerving if you don't know what they are, but she's fine.
Thank you doctor. Oh thank you for being so nice and calm.
Calm?! I wasn't calm! I've never been more scared in all my life!
But wait you said everything was gonna be okay.
Well what do I know?! I'm not a doctor!
But I-But everything is okay. I'm fine!
You sure?!
Yes! Yes! I got half a mind to contract that doctor's uterus though. Mild discomfort, what's he talking about?
Oh hey-hey!
Is everything okay?
Yeah, everything's fine!
Your page said come to the hospital, what? What was it? What happened?
Something called Braxton-Hicks contractions.
Oh. Oh. Thank God, most women don't even feel them.
Okay, no uterus, no opinion.
Hey uh, what's with the candy?
Oh when you beeped me I was on line at the concession stand at the movie theater.
Oh you went to the movies by yourself?
No I-Mona!
Oh, I gotta go back in there.
What? Why? What's wrong?
No, everything's fine. I just gotta go back...
No really, you tell me what's up.
I-I forgot my underwear.
So, thanks so much for bringing her to the hospital.
Oh hey, don't worry about it man. Don't worry about it, no big deal.
Yeah but still, I mean it should've been me. I'm the dad.
Uh, if you have any questions, here's some information on Braxton-Hicks. Oh and by the way, you did the right thing by bringing her in. You're gonna make a wonderful father.
Oh uh, hey. Not as good as this guy! He brought Twizlers!
There has got to be a way!
Easy there Captain Kirk. Oh, do you have a bobby pin?
Yeah. Oh no wait, I'm not an nine-year-old girl.
Then why do you throw like one?
Maybe Monica has a bobby pin.
Sure. "Monica."
So, how's the hideously inappropriate crush on Rachel coming?
Uh, really good. Really good. Yeah, I should be ready to kill myself any day now. Wow, you sure found that quick. I just-I wish I didn't feel this way about Rachel anymore, y'know? I wish things could go back to normal. I mean, I love living with her and God, helping out with the baby is just amazing, but now I think...I think Ross feels left out. Y'know? When I had to take Rachel to the hospital, the doctor thought I was the father. God... You should've seen the look on Ross's face. By the way, I have no idea what I'm doing here. For all I know I'm just locking it more. Oh hey, did you try opening it with a credit card?
That's a good idea.
Yeah.
Okay. So uh, Ross is kinda bummed huh?
Oh, I just...I feel terrible.
Well, it's not your fault. What are you gonna do? Not take her to the hospital? Y'know? You're doing nothing wrong. Except for harboring an all consuming love for the woman whose carrying his baby. Richard? If-if you're in there, could you pass me my credit card?
Hey.
Hey.
I gotta tell you, yesterday was amazing. That massage felt so good!
No-no, I got that.
So umm, what do you say we make it a weekly appointment?
Okay. Okay but you should know though, I've raised my rates to $200 an hour.
Okay.
I mean $500.
What?
600.
What's going on?
Oh, you make sex noises when you get massaged!
What?
Yeah, and it really freaked me out! And after a while I even tried to hurt you and it just spurred you on.
What?! You're crazy! There's nothing sexual about the noises I make!
Really? There's nothing sexual about this? Oooh. Oo God! Ohh. Ohhhh. Ohh. What are you looking at?! I mean hi.
Oh my-This is so embarrassing. Oh my God, I'm never gonna get massaged again!
No, you can't let this stop you from getting massages! No look, I have, I have lots of clients that make the same noises you do!
Really?!
Well not clients, lovers. But let's just y'know, try it again. Come back and-and we'll work through it.
Are you sure?
Yes.
I guess.
Great! Okay, if you'll just excuse me. So, did you hear something you liked?
Hey Ross! Check it out! I learned a new trick!
Hey uh, I brought you some lunch.
Ohh! That's so sweet of you! Oh yum! Did you put pickles on this?
Well yeah!
Oh Ross!!
What?! What?! Rach what?!
What's going on?
I made her favorite, tuna salad with pickles.
Pickle? Pickles make her sick. Giving her pickles is like giving me salad.
I-I'm sorry Rach, I didn't know. Are you gonna be okay?
Yeah, I'll be fine. But could someone please make sure that sandwich is gone when I get out there?
I'm on it!
I can't believe this! I shouldn't be the one making her throw up!
Dude relax! It could happen to anyone.
Yeah? Not to you, because you know this stuff. I don't know any of it and I'm the father. I wish I'd be more involved y'know.
Well, if anyone is keeping score, I no longer eat tuna.
Hey uh, can I, can I talk to you guys for a second?
Yeah.
What's up?
Uh, sit down. I wanna talk about our situation.
Are you breaking up with us?
The thing is...'cause I live with Rachel I'm here for a lot of the stuff, okay? And Ross...Ross is missing everything. So...
Yeah?
Maybe you two should live together.
Are you asking me to move out? Do you not want me here?
Oh no-no, no-no I love living with you. It just seems that...if you're gonna have a roommate, y'know it might as well be the father.
But Joey, I don't think Ross wants me to move into his apartment and disrupt his life like that. I mean--Or he does.
No I-I-I would love to be around for you and the baby. And we-we can just try it like on a temporary basis.
But Ross, its you and me!
So? Sure! But it-it wouldn't be anything romantic. And I'm-I'm dating Mona-Damnit Mona! I was supposed to meet her like an hour ago! What is wrong with me?!
All right now, so? What do you think?
I don't know. Is it crazy?
No! No it's not. Joey, this is a smart idea.
Well, I was due.
Okay, let's do it. I'll move in.
Really?
Yeah.
Oh Rach that's great. That's great.
Not to shabby, I got this all off myself...using my wife's tools. Oh my God!
How did you get in there?!
You're messy.
Oh no! You weren't supposed to see this!
I married Fred Sanford!
No Chandler, you don't understand! Okay! Okay! Okay! Fine! Now you know. Okay? I'm y'know...I'm sick.
No, honey you're not sick! Look, I don't love you because you're organized, I love you in spite of that.
Really? You promise you won't tell anyone?
Yes! And look, now that I know if I got some extra stuff lying around can we, can we share the closet.
Well...it's just umm...I'm afraid you might mess it up.
Hey.
Hey.
So Rachel's all moved out huh? How are you taking it?
Well uh, I wanted to have a few beers, but uh, I got rid of those because Rachel couldn't stand the smell of them. But I have thrown back a lot of orange juice with calcium though. And uh, it's a couple weeks past it's expiration date, so it's got a bit of a kick.
Are you okay?
Are you kidding me? I'm great! Yeah, I'm uh; I'm better than great. I am good. And now that she's gone, I can uh, I can do all this stuff around here that I couldn't do before. Y'know? Like umm, I can walk around naked again. Y'know? I can uh, I can watch porn in the living room. Right? This is uh, this is good for me. Y'know? I like being on my own, I'm uh, better off this way. I'm uh, a lone wolf. Y'know? A loner. Alone. All alone. Forever. What's a wolf got to do to get a huh around here?!
Ohhh.
That's it. Just relax.
Ohh. Oh! Ohh!
Come on more!
Oh God!
Yeah, you like that don't you?
Oh yeah right there!
You want it there? You take it there baby!
Uh Phoebe?
Yeah, say my name. Say it! And now I'm going to cover you back up, and umm we're never doing this again.
Oh! Hey, Rach!
Hi! Hey, Happy Valentine's Day!
Oh, you, too.
Hey, so, uh, how's it going living over at Ross'?
It's good. Except he makes us watch the Discovery Channel all day long. Did you know that something really boring happened to someone really ugly in the Middle Ages? Oh, thank you. I'll see you guys later.
Okay.
Bye.
There's one lucky to-go cup of coffee.
Honey, I wish you would get over her. I hate seeing you like this. Is there anything I can do for you? Do you want to look down my top?
Thanks. But maybe later.
Oh, Gunther, can I get a scone?
You want anything?
You know what I want? I want a lot of things! I want to be with the woman I love on Valentine's Day! And I want her to love me back! And I want just one moment of relief from the gut-wrenching pain of knowing that that's never going to happen!
We have red bagels.
Oh, okay.
So, how does Mona feel about you and Rachel living together?
Oh, I'm actually on my way to tell her right now. Yeah, she's been away all week visiting her parents, but she'll be cool. I mean, she's been so supportive. She-she even got the baby a tiny T-shirt that says, 'Fossils are my friends.'
Ugh. Come on, Mona, don't kiss ass.
Uh, I'm going to take off.
All right. Oh! Shoot! Oh shoot! Uh, Rachel wanted to see this tape!
What is it?
It's a video of my friend giving birth. Could you just bring it back to your apartment?
All right. 'Candy and Cookie?'
Yeah. Candy's the mother, Cookie's the daughter. The father's also Cookie. Why am I friends with these people?
Phoebe, c'mere. I want to show you something in the bathroom.
Oh, Monica, grow up!
Hey, what's behind your back?
Nothing. Just something I want to get Phoebe's opinion on for Valentine's Day.
You don't want my opinion?
Not really.
Come on, I'm your older brother, ask me!
All right, big brother. Which of these do you think would make your little sister look hotter, so your best friend would want to do her?
The red one.
Hey. Look, I know you've been really depressed lately, so I brought someone over to cheer you up. Right outside this door is a real, live, furry playmate.
No, I'm not sleeping with your friend Jane again.
He-hee!
Hey! A dog! Hi! Who, you got to admit, looks a lot like Jane.
This is the happiest dog in the world. I borrowed him from my friend Wendy. Now, you can only keep him until he cheers you up. And he will cheer you up!
Thanks so much, Pheebs! We are going to have so much fun, yes we are! Oh! Not that kind of fun.
Happy Valentine's!
Okay! I'll be right out. I'm slipping into something a little less comfortable, and a little more slutty.
'Candy and Cookie'. 'Candy and Cookie?' Monica got me porn?! Girl-on-girl porn?! She really must love me!!
Yeah, just relax.
I love you, St. Valentine.
Woah, woah, that's not pretty!
Now, push!
Ow! Ow! Ooh! That hurts!
Worst porn ever! Worst porn ever!
Ohhh! Make it stop!
I am trying!
Get the ball, ready? Get the ball, get the ball! Well, you're cute, but you're not too smart!
Did I just throw this?
Hi.
Hi.
I accidentally packed these with my stuff. Who is this?
Oh, that's, uh, that's Phoebe's friend's dog. I don't know what his real name is, but I call him Mozzarella.
Oh, well, you are so cute! I wish I could play with you more, but I've got to go to work! I hope I stop talking like this before my marketing meeting, yes I do. Yes I do. Bye-bye, Joey. Oh, I seriously can't stop it.
C'mere. Hey. C'mere. That's Rachel. She's the one who used to live here. Might as well be honest with you-we love her. But we can't have her. I really miss her. Well, hey, you understand, right? You're a guy. Well, you used to be.
So what do you think?
I've still got it!
Why did you get me this?
What is it?
It's yelling...bleeding...dilating. Oh, the dilating...
Is this the video of the baby being born? Sweetie, this is Phoebe's. Why were you even watching it?
I thought...maybe...you got me porn for Valentine's Day.
Chandler, if you thought I was going to get you porn for Valentine's Day... you were right! Apparently, it's about a young girl who moves to the big city, you know, in search of stardom, but ends up having sex with a lot of guys! Yeah, it got four starts! Oh, wait a minute. Those aren't stars. Anyway, you want to take a look?
Well, I'm not really in a sexy mood right now.
Honey, what's going on?
Well, remember the first time we saw Jaws?
Mm-hmm.
How long it took to go back in the water?
Chandler, we can't let this tape wreck Valentine's Day!
You don't know. You didn't see it.
Child-birth, it's a natural thing! It's beautiful.
Oh, beautiful? Really? Beautiful? You think this is beautiful?
Oh! Oh, my God! No wonder my mother hates me!
See, honey, there's-
Don't touch me!
Hi!
Hey! So, how was Atlantic City?
Good.
Yeah?
I brought you back a present.
Wha-? Oh, come on. You didn't have to-saltwater taffy?! Thanks! This is interesting. You know, most people think this is made with sea water, but it's actually made with, uh, salted fresh water. That's not interesting.
I think it's interesting.
I do too! I missed you!
I missed you, too! So, how was your week?
Oh, it was good! It was good. Actually, the baby started kicking!
How exciting!
Yeah! I know! It was. Oh... the only sad thing is I wasn't around when it happened for the first time.
Oh no.
Yeah, I'm missing out on all this other stuff, too. So, Joey suggested Rachel move in with me.
Yeah right!
What?
Joey cracks me up! It's like, 'Yeah, why don't you have your ex-wife move in with you? That wouldn't be awkward at all!'
Huh...uh-huh.
Huh, could you imagine. I go away for a few days, and come back, and my boyfriend is living with some woman he got pregnant!
So, what'd you tell him?
Just a second!
How could you not tell Mona that Rachel is living with you?
I don't know, she seemed to think it was such a crazy idea! Um, plus, she, uh, she got me taffy!
Taffy, really? I've never had any.
Ever?!
Well, I think my mother was too busy planning her suicide to provide saltwater treats. Thank you! So what, you're just never going to tell her?
Oh, no, no, no, I will! I just want to butter her up, first! You know, I'm going to take her to an amazing Valentine's dinner. Do all this romantic stuff, and then, just when she thinks I'm the best boyfriend in the world, then I'm going to tell her that my pregnant ex-girlfriend is living with me.
she's a lucky, lucky lady! So, where are you going to-what the mother of crap is up with this stuff? Oh, God. Is it gum, is it food? What's the deal? Oh, it's nice! May I try a pink one?
So, between her and me being friends, and her history with Ross, it just isn't going to happen. It would be like you falling in love with a cat.
Hey!
Hey.
Hey, buddy. How's my favorite dog, huh? How's my favorite dog? You're subdued. Did you give him a beer?
No.
Will you excuse us, we need to talk for a moment.
Yeah, sure. Go ahead. Oh, me, right!
He's miserable! What happened to him?
Nothing. We just talked about stuff.
What stuff?
Rachel stuff.
Oh...Joey, you bummed him out! This was the happiest dog in the world, and he spends half a day with you, and look at him!
He's breathing!
Okay, I'm going to take him back to Wendy's.
No, no, no, no! He's fine! Look, look, look! Here's your ball! Get your ball! Get your ball! Get your ball! My God, what have I done to you, huh? I broke the dog! Pheebs, I broke the dog!
Well, I'm, uh, going to pick up Mona. What have you got going tonight?
Oh, I've got big Valentine's plans! I've got my Chinese food on the way, and the rest of your saltwater taffy!
Y'know, it's interesting! Most people think that's made with seawater, when in fact-
Ross, we actually watched the documentary together.
Ooh! My Chinese food! Let me get my cash!
Mona? What are-hi! What are you doing here? I'm, um, supposed to pick you up!
Change of plans, I made you a special Valentine's dinner! Surprise!
Ayyyayyyy!
Oh, hey, Mona!
Hi! Hi. Hi, Rachel! What's she doing here?
I have no idea!
I'll be watching TV if anybody needs me.
Seriously, what is she doing?
Uh...lately, she just likes hanging out here.
Why?
I think she's lonely.
Okay, but it's Valentine's Day!
I know.
Can't we just ask her to go?
No, no. She's way to emotional. And by emotional I mean crazy.
I'm not here! That's just my Chinese food!
Oh, my God! She has food delivered here?
Mm-hmm. She's-she's emotional, but, but ballsy.
You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to get in my sweats, and eat this in bed!
And you thought she was going to be in our way! So, why don't you, uh, open the champagne, and I'll be right back. I've got a surprise for you.
You got another ex-wife back there?
Please start drinking!
I'm just going to grab the phone.
Oh, Rachel! Wait! Hey, I hope you don't take this the wrong way, but, but, um... what are you doing?
Oh, I'm sorry! Do you need the phone?
No, no. Listen, Ross is too nice to say anything, but this is his apartment, and, and, we gotta have some boundaries, so why don't you go back to your place and give us some privacy?
But, but, Mona, I live here.
Happy Valentine's Day! ...Or something to remember me by.
How long has it been this time?
90 seconds.
That's better. 90 seconds is a long time not to think about it...except all I did was think about it.
You know, it haunts me? Up 'til now, the worst thing I ever saw, was my father doing tequila shots off the naked houseboy. After this, I would gladly make that my screensaver!
Okay, well, we have to get past this! Why don't we get rid of the tape and pretend it never existed?
I can do that.
Okay.
Okay. Now all we've got to do is get rid of this chair.
Oh, thank God!
Oh, I know!
Come in!
Hi! I'm so sorry to barge in on your Valentine's, but I had to get away from all the yelling. Mona is dumping Ross.
Oh, my God.
Poor Ross.
Oh, great. We have to watch him do yoga in his underwear, but for this he closes the drapes!
Rach, you know that birthing tape you wanted to see? It's here.
Oh, And We Should Warn You, Before You Watch It don't watch it.
Why? You saw it? Is it scary?
Well, let's just say it's ironic how footage of someone being born can make you want to kill yourself.
Well, now, wait. Now I'm all freaked out. Come on, you guys will watch it with me.
No, but I will leave a sweater that smells like me right next to you!
C'mon, seriously, you guys, you're not going to make me watch this alone!
She's right...of course not. Honey, get the tape.
This reminds me of a very specific part of the tape. Okay, here we go.
Okay. Ooh, my! Woah! Why is that baby torturing that woman?!
Why have I seen this thing three times?!
It's...still beautiful.
Uh! It's horrible!
I know! I know, I'm so sorry for you!
Oh, my God!
Wait, you guys, look!
What? Did her ass explode?!
No, the baby's out! Look, look!
Oh, look at those little fingers and toes!
And look how happy the mom is now!
Oh...Rach!
Oh, screw you guys, you don't have to do it!
Hey, hey, man!
Hey, what's up?
Uh...Mona just dumped me.
Oh, man, I'm sorry. Why?
Well, with everything that's been going on lately, I haven't exactly been the perfect boyfriend. You know, I, uh, I didn't tell her I got Rachel pregnant. I gave her a key to my apartment, and then had the locks changed! And then I lied to her about Rachel moving in with me. In a way, I actually judge her for not breaking up with me sooner, you know?
Still, that really sucks, man. Especially on Valentine's Day.
Yeah. Wait a minute. What are you doing here? Joey Tribbiani without a date on Valentine's Day? What's going on, huh? Girl trouble?
Sort of.
Really?!
You don't have to seem so happy about it.
Oh, sorry. Well, look, maybe I can help you with it.
Oh, I...I d-
Hey, whatever it is, I am sure it has happened to me. Y'know, actually once-once I got dumped during sex.
Anyway, so, uh, so what is it?
Forget about it. It's no big deal.
C'mon! Joey! What is it?
It's nothing.
Hey, hey, it's me. Why can't you tell me?
Okay, uh...sit down. Um... there's this woman that I like. A lot. But, uh...it can't happen.
She's not a Tribbiani?
No!
I knew it. So, is she someone from work?
Yes.
Well, uh, does she like you?
Sometimes I think maybe she could. But it doesn't matter, because I can't do anything about it.
Why not?
Well, it's complicated. She's with this other guy. For a long time. Someone from work, too. And I could never do that to the guy, because we're really good friends.
So, uh, this guy, she used to go out with, is, uh... is he still in love with her?
No. I don't think so.
Okay. Um... is he a good guy?
Yeah, he's the best.
Then talk to him! He might be fine with it.
Oh, I don't know.
Joey, it's worth finding out. I mean, if you really like her.
I do! So much! I can't stop thinking about her! I can't sleep, I-
Okay, Joey, you know what? You have to go for it. How often does this happen to you, huh? You owe it to yourself.
Here's your warm milk.
I'm going to...uh...I'm going to, um, put the bourbon in it at home.
Oh, yeah.
Anyway... seriously, uh...just...just talk to the guy, okay? And tell me how it goes.
It's Rachel.
You're going to have a baby, and you need to be prepared. Now, you're going to make yourself watch the whole thing. Just do it!
I came to the big city to become a star! I'll do...anything to make that happen!
Anything?
Hmm...maybe it starts with how she gets pregnant.
There's this woman, that I like. A lot. Well, it's complicated. She's with this other guy. For a long time. And I could never do that to the guy, y'know? 'Ccause we're really good friends.
So, uh, this guy, she used to go out with, is, uh... is he a good guy?
Yeah, he's the best.
Then talk to him! He might be fine with it.
Oh, I don't know.
Joey, it's worth finding out. I mean, if you really like her.
I do! So much! I can't stop thinking about her! I can't sleep, I-
Okay, Joey, you know what? You have to go for it. How often does this happen to you, huh? You owe it to yourself.
It's Rachel.
Did you um-I'm sorry, did you just say it's Rachel?
Yes.
Um, you...you like Rachel?
Yes. I like Rachel.
Rachel?!
Yeah, okay but look, buy uh-Hey-hey, y'know, y'know who else I like? You! And it-it doesn't get said enough. I like you Ross.
But R-R-Rachel-Rachel?!
Yeah, but it's not a big deal.
It's not a big deal? Oh, I'm sorry I just...um, I...what about all the stuff you-you just said? I mean how about, I like-you-you can't stop thinking about her. Like how you can't sleep?
I'm an actor, y'know? As-as a group, we tend to be over dramatic.
Rachel who's carrying my baby? Rachel?
Look no, I-I know it's bad, and I know it's wrong. Okay? But-but it's not like anything's ever gonna happen. Y'know? These-these are just feelings, they're gonna go away.
Y'know what? I-I gotta go.
Oh come on Ross! Hey Ross-Ross don't...
I just-y'know-I-I just have one-Rachel?!
Rachel?!!
Oh-oh! Okay, she's kicking!
Oh! She's growing inside you.
Whoa!!
Oh!
Wow that was a big one.
I think that's the youngest girl ever to reject me.
Oh hey you guys!
Oh hey!
Hi!
Hey listen let me ask you, do you believe in soul mates?
Oh yes I do. I do. I believe that there is one perfect person out there for everyone. And do you know how you find him? You stop looking for him. That's why I stopped looking for Russell Crowe. He'll find me.
Uh-huh, and you?
No. I mean I believe that uh, certain people are more suited for each other and I believe in falling in love, but soul mates, I don't think they exist.
Okay, good.
Why?
Well last night, I met Monica's.
What?
Yeah, I had a date with this guy, and I swear to God, he is her other half.
Come on, don't be crazy. You don't think there's someone out there better suited for Monica than me, do ya?
Well, what's he like?!
Well he's tall.
Uh-huh.
He has brown hair.
Of course, of course.
A tall guy with hair similar to mine, oh unknowable universe!
He works with food!
Oh sure. Older?
Obviously, and he's British.
Oh, I was just gonna ask!
Yeah? And, he's-he's so centered and mature and confident.
Oh, it's so sad they never had a chance to meet.
Luckily, the guy she settled for can't hear what you're talking about.
Oh, I'm so sorry. Um, and maybe I'm wrong! I but-y'know I'm gonna go out with him again, I'll find out more.
You believe that this guy is destined for someone else and you're still gonna date him?
Well, he may not be my soul mate, but a girl's gotta eat.
Hey.
Hey.
I just talked to Joey, I just-I want to see how you were.
Oh y'know, I still-I can't believe it. Joey and Rachel I mean it's... It's like you and me going out, only weirder!
All right, I know you're hurting, and-and I want to be supportive, but don't say that again.
Oh my God! What if, what if they get married? Then he'd be the stepfather of my child.
Honey, I don't think that's something we need to worry about! First of all he's-he's never gonna tell her how he feels about her. And even if he did you have no idea how she'd react.
Sure, because women never like Joey. Y'know, I think he's a virgin.
Joey...he's not even thinking about going after Rachel!
He's not?
No! All he's thinking about is how you're taking this! I mean, listen it's totally freaking him out. He's talking about moving to Vermont.
Why?
He says he wants to leave the country. He thinks you hate him.
Hate him? I... No, I don't hate him. It's just it's Rachel, y'know?
Honey I can't even imagine how hard this must be for you. But, I don't want you to lose Joey over it. And right now he just needs to know that you're still his friend.
Okay. Okay, I'll talk to him.
All right. Now do it soon, he just asked me how to convert his dollars into Vermont money.
Oh! Hi!
Hi!
Umm, Chandler, Monica, this is Don.
Oh, hello. Hello.
Soul mate.
What?
Soul mate.
So, what have you guys been doing?
Well, we just had a terrible lunch today at Reattica. What is with all the sun-dried tomatoes at that place?
I know! What is this, 1985?!
That's exactly what I said. Phoebe, isn't that strange.
Not really.
What's wrong with sun-dried tomatoes? On a barbecue chicken pizza? No?
So Don, what-what other restaurants do you like?
Well, Octavio, 27&7-Oh! And there's this great little place, Alessandro's.
Oh my God! That's my restaurant, I'm the chef there.
You're kidding me!
No!
Your food is fantastic! Wow, I really want to talk to you about your menu, once I get some coffees first. Um, anyone want any?
Oh, I'd like a latte. Oh y'know what? If you're gonna talk about me, I'm gonna go with you.
What are you doing?!
Nothing! I swear to God I didn't know you guys would be here! And the good news is you didn't believe in soul mates. So...
I believe in tall, handsome strangers who hit on my wife!
They're just talking, and y'know what? Just because I think they're soul mates doesn't mean anything's gonna happen.
Phoebe, good work.
Yeah?
Yeah! Oh he's great, I love him.
Don't worry, we'll find you someone else.
Hey.
Hey.
Look, I understand if you came by to hit me, I deserve it.
No, I don't want to hit you.
Oh what then? Kick me?
No.
Bite me?
No, no I don't want to do anything to you. All right? I just want to tell you that I'm not mad at you and...and that I certainly do not hate you. I just, I just came here to say that.
Oh now-Hey Ross-Ross! Do you wanna-wanna come in for a beer or something?
Uh...yeah sure.
Do uh, do you got any beer? All-all I got is this melon stuff that Rachel left. I don't...
Okay.
Hey look Ross, you need to understand something okay? I uh...I am never gonna act on this Rachel thing, okay? I-I would never do anything to jeopardize my friendship with you.
Thank you.
Anyway, it uh...look it'll just...take me a while to get over her, that's all. I'm not even sure how to do that, I mean I've never been in love before so...
What?! You're in love with her.
Yeah, I thought you knew that.
Umm, no.
Wow. Hey look, if it helps, I don't want to feel this way. Honest. I just keep thinking, "Ah, I'll get over this." Y'know? I just-It just keeps gettin' harder. I don't, I don't know what to do. Y'know? What do I do?
I think you need to tell her how you feel.
Okay that's the green stuff talkin'.
No, I'm serious. You-you need to find out where she is, because if she's not where you are, then you can start to move past this.
But what if uh-and I'm not saying she will be-But...
If she is where you are then uh...then my feeling weird about it shouldn't stand in the way.
Are you sure?
Yeah. Look if-if she's gonna end up with somebody else, the truth is she couldn't find a better guy. So...
Hey thanks.
So when do you think you're gonna talk to her?
Oh my God I have to tell her! I haven't even thought about what I will say. What should I say?
I'm understanding, but let's not get carried away.
I'm sorry, you're right. What am I gonna say? Oh!
Yeah, tell me about it.
...so I've been slowly phasing out the wine importing and focusing more on the cheese side of things.
Cheese you say? That's some pretty smelly work, huh Don?
Excuse me?
Cheese, it's smelly. You must smell a lot of the time too.
Uh, not really. But when it comes to cheese, I'm one of the people who thinks the smellier the better.
Me too! Yeah, Chandler can't stand it. He won't even allow me to have blue cheese in the house.
And you're still married to him?
You know what I'd love to do? I would like to go to France and eat nothing but bread and cheese-Not even bread, just cheese. No, I want the bread. Yeah. Ah, and pastries... And pate. Oh, I'm really not high, it's just I used to be fat.
Well if you where ever enter the Loire valley let me know, I've got a great little villa you can stay at.
Is it made of cheese?
No. But God, a house made of cheese, wouldn't that be incredible?!
I'd move in tomorrow!
Oh come on! Are you listening to this?
I'm so sorry.
What do we do?
I don't know, they both want to live in a house of cheese! I don't know how you fight that.
Okay. Okay, I can do this. I can tell her how I feel. Just uh, just stand up straight. Take a couple deep breaths. Look confident.
Joey? What's up?
I uh, I just came by because I-I want to talk to you about something.
Okay what's up?
Here? In the hall? What are we animals?
Well honey, I'm late for a meeting. So can you just make it quick?
Okay umm, I just came by to tell you that I...want to have dinner with you tonight. That's all.
Sure! That sounds great! Just leave me a message and tell me where to meet you. Okay?
Okay. That's good. Okay, that give you a couple hours to prepare what you're gonna say. Good. Yeah. Don't you people ever knock?!
I'd like to have Don and Phoebe over. Wouldn't that be nice?
Sure, why don't you set it up. I'll just be over here, browsing through the personals.
Are you okay? You've been acting weird all afternoon.
Yeah, fine. Fine. Not perfect!! But good enough.
Jeez! What is with you?
I'm sorry, did you say cheese?
All right, what's going on?
Phoebe thinks you and Don are soul mates, and I don't believe in that kind of stuff. But then you two totally get along. So look, I won't stand in your way if you want to run off with Don and live in a house of cheese.
Chandler, you don't believe in soul mates?
No. But I'm sure 'tomatoes' does.
I don't believe in soul mates either.
You don't?
No. I don't think that you and I were destined to end up together. I think that we fell in love and work hard at our relationship. Some days we work really hard.
So you...you don't want to live with Don in a cheese house?
No, I've had second thoughts about that. Do you realize how hard that would be to clean?
I love you.
I know.
Y'know what? I am going to take you out to dinner tonight. I found this place that makes the greatest mozzarella sticks and jalepino poppers. No? Really? They taste so good.
...and I know Chandler is kidding but it happens every time he touches my stomach. I mean I'm really worried the baby's not going to like him. Are you okay?
What? Yeah! Sure! Uh, look at the uh, the reason...-Is it hot in here?
No. Not-not for me, but why don't you take off your sweater?
I would, but this is a nice place and my T-shirt has a picture of Calvin doing Hobbs.
Oh my God! Really?! Can I see it?
Yeah. Sure.
Huh. Wow, I wouldn't think Hobbs would like that so much.
Uh... How long have we known each other?
Um, seven...e-e-eight, eight years. Wow.
Uh-huh, long time.
Yeah.
But over the past few weeks...
Hah, sorry about the wait, but it is mega-jammed in here! We have a couple specials tonight...
Actually uh, could you give us a second?
Sure. Sure. Second's up! Not...that kind of table.
So you were saying?
I'm not quite sure.
Okay, well you had asked me how long we had known each other, and I said, "Eight years." And the um, waiter came over and cut his tip in half, and umm...now here we are.
Yeah, here we are. Uhh... I... I think I'm...falling in love with you.
What?
I'm falling in love with you.
Who are you talking too? Oh, you're kidding! Oh, it's a joke! It's funny. It's funny. I don't get it. Oh. Okay. Umm... I-I...uh, wow. Are you uh... How did umm... When?
Does it really matter?
Wow! Wow. Wow. Wow, it is hot in here.
Okay look Rach, I know this is a lot. You don't have to say anything. You-you uh, you take as much time as you need. Okay, you gotta say something!
Joey, Joey I love you so much, but I...
But.
Joey.
Yeah-yeah right. That's okay. That's fine. That's uh, pretty much what I was expecting. So uh, it's no big deal. All right? I think I'm gonna go.
No! Joey please! Please don't! Please don't leave like this! Now come on, you cannot do this to a pregnant woman!
Don't start doing that. You can't do that Rach, 'cause then you're gonna make me do that. Oh, here we go!
Can I?
Sure!
Oh Joey honey I don't...I don't want to lose...
Hey-hey-hey, hey! You can't. Okay? Ever!
I'm so sorry.
Oh no-no Rach, please, don't be sorry. Okay? Don't be sorry. Y'know I was only kidding you.
Yeah, that was a real good one.
Is this your table?
Yeah.
God, you're gonna be here all night!
I know! I haven't even read them the specials yet!
What's the matter with them?
I don't know. I think maybe one of them is dying. I kinda hope it's the girl. The guy is really cute!
Joey? Are you in there?
Oh God! That's Rachel!
Joey, you have to talk to her!
No-no, I can't! I can't! Not after the other night, it's just it's...too weird, okay? Don't tell her I'm here! Don't eat that!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey Rachel!
Is Joey here?
I don't see him. Do you see him?
I don't see him. Hey! Maybe he's in the sugar bowl! Joey? Nope!
Well, at least you make each other laugh.
What's up?
Well, I haven't seen him since that night that he told me how he y'know... I don't know, I think he's avoiding me. Why is that bagel on the floor?
We were playing a game.
Ew, was Chandler naked? Sort of like a, like a ring toss kind of situation?
Sure.
What?! No! No!
All right. Well listen, if you see Joey will you just tell him uh...tell him I miss him.
Okay, did you hear that?
Yeah, a naked bagel game? Dude, I don't know. That's a pretty small hole.
Honey, you gotta talk to her.
I can't! Y'know? You guys don't know what it's like to put yourself out there like that and just get shot down.
I don't know what that's like?! Up until I was 25 I thought the only response to, "I love you," was, "Oh crap!"
Hello? No rejection? I got shot down at fat camp! Boy, kids are mean when they're hungry.
All right so, so what do I do?
This is Rachel. I mean, what are you gonna do, never going to talk to her again? I mean I know it's weird, it's awkward, but you gotta at least try.
Yeah. Okay. Whoa! I almost forgot this was on your...
We didn't play it!!
Okay, so when you're done with your tea I'll look at your leaves and tell you your fortune.
I didn't know you read tea leaves.
Oh yeah, I've done it for years. I actually stopped because I was so accurate. Y'know, and-and y'know, one of the great joys of life is it's-it's wondrous unpredictability. Y'know? And also tea tends to give me the trots.
Okay, I'm done. Read mine.
Okay. Ooh, I see a ladder. Which can mean either a promotion or a violent death.
I-I'm the head chef. I-I can't get promoted.
Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm, who's next?
Okay, I'm done. Do mine.
Okay. Umm, oh! Okay, I see a circle.
Ah.
Oh! Which can either mean you're having a baby or you're gonna make a scientific discovery!
Well, I have been spending a lot of time in the lab.
What does yours say Pheebs?
Umm... Wow, all right. Wow! Yay! Ooh, I'm gonna meet a guy! And really soon! And he's gonna be the man of my dreams. Probably not the guy I had a dream about last night.
Hey! Has anyone seen my shirt? It's a button down, like a, like a faded salmon?
You mean your pink shirt?
Faded salmon color.
No, I-I haven't seen your pink shirt.
Great! Great. Then I must've left it at Mona's. I knew it!
Well, I'm sure you get another one at Ann Taylor's.
That's my favorite shirt! Okay? I love that shirt!
Well just ask Mona to give it back!
I don't know. I mean I-I guess I could. It's just that we didn't really end things such good terms. And if I go over there I'd be ignoring the one thing she asked me to do when we broke up, jump up my own ass and die.
Oh wait a second you guys...for the last couple weeks I've been that guy everywhere I go. We take the same bus. We go to the same bookstore, the same dry cleaners; maybe he's the tea guy.
Phoebe, did you see that?! He totally checked you out! He is so cute! Mine has a picture of The Village People, what does that mean?
Hi!
Hey.
Hi.
Hi.
Tea gives Phoebe the trots.
So I thought Joey and I would be okay once we hung out, but it's not even like we know how to be with each other anymore.
I know it's tough now, but things will get better.
How do you know that? What if it just gets worse and worse and worse, to the point where we can't even be in the same room with each other?!
I'm not great at the advice, can I interest you in a sarcastic comment? Some cheese?
Honey, what is the Bruce Springsteen CD in the Kat Stevens case?
Let's just say if I can't find the right CD case I just put it in the nearest one.
Okay, where is the Kat Stevens CD?
In the James Taylor case.
Where is the James Taylor CD?
Honey, I'm gonna save you some time, 200 CDs, not one of them in the right case.
Okay. No need to panic. Deep breathes everyone. Okay umm uh, we're just gonna have to spend some time and put the CDs in the right cases.
Well, if we're gonna do that we should come up with some kind of order. Y'know alphabetically or by genre?
Hmm, I don't know. We really have to talk this through.
Oh my God!! You guys have such problems!! I feel so terrible for you!
Okay, I-I'm sorry. You and Joey, your both focusing on this uncomfortable thing, what you need to do is to change the subject. Next time you see him try to get him talking about something else.
Oh yeah. That makes sense.
Yeah, like I don't know, maybe you have a work problem that you need his advice on.
Ooh, I can do that.
Good. Uh honey, the Miami Vice soundtrack? Really?
They were just giving those away at the store in exchange for money.
Hey!
Hi.
Uh I really don't know what to tell you Rach, I really don't. I mean, maybe Joey can help you out with your, with your big work problem.
What?
Yeah Joey she's...Rachel's got this really big work problem, and it is a head scratcher. Wow! Y'know what, if we're gonna make dinner we're gonna have to leave. Yeah.
So you uh, have a...big work problem?
Yeah it's umm... Yeah it's uh... It-it's y'know-It's nothing.
Huh. Okay. So uh, I think I'm gonna take off.
Yeah-No wait! Joey no wait it is. It's something. It's-it's umm...it's my boss.
Yeah?
Yeah, and umm my baby.
Yeah?
My boss wants to buy my baby!
What?! Oh my-oh my God!
I know I told you, it's a really big problem.
What he wants to buy your baby?!
Can you believe that?!
That's crazy!
That's what I told him!
Okay, how did this even happen?
Well I'll tell ya! See uh my-my boss and his wife-They-they can't have children. So umm, and that-we were at the Christmas party, and he got drunk, and he said to me, "Rachel, I want to buy your baby."
Man! When you said it was a problem about your boss and the baby I figured it was something about maternity leave.
Ohh! Yeah! Yeah that-that would've been a much simpler problem.
Oh hello.
Oh, it's you. I see you everywhere. I'm Jim, Jim Nelson.
Oh Jim, Jim Nelson I'm Phoebe, Phoebe Buffay. We certainly have been seeing a lot of each other lately.
We have. Maybe we'll be seeing each other at dinner tomorrow night, say around 8 o'clock?
Well, maybe we will. Oh!
Mona? Okay, if I were a salmon shirt, where would I be?
I am so sorry I spilled wine all over your shirt.
Oh, it's okay.
No, it's still wet. Y'know what? Let me get it out before it sets. Ooh, I have something you can wear. Here.
Oh umm, I-I don't know if I want to wear a woman's shirt.
No-no that's a man's shirt.
It's awfully pink.
Oh my God, honey we are so meant to be together. We both have copies of the Annie soundtrack.
Honey, both yours.
Hey! Great advice on that Joey thing!
Yeah? The work problem?
Oh it was perfect! I mean it really felt like he was my friend again.
What problem did you tell him you had?
Oh that's not important. The point is, I really-I think everything's gonna be okay.
May I help you?
Do you think you can just buy my friends baby?!
Isn't it funny how we kept running into each other? It's as if someone really wants us to be together.
Someone does. Me.
Oh, witty banter. Well done.
So, tell me a little bit about yourself.
Oh okay, well I'm a masseuse, and I used to work at this place...
Do you like to party?
I-I-I like, I like parties.
You're wild, aren't ya?
Yeah I guess, a little.
It ain't no thing, I'm wild too.
So! Umm, anyway I-I lived in New York, someone wildly I guess, for umm-Well since I was fourteen.
I'm sorry. I'm staring. It's just that you have the most beautiful eyes.
Oh stop it.
And your breasts! Hmm!!!
Okay. Umm look, you're coming on a little strong. But I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt, because it seems the universe really wants to be together. So, why don't we just start over okay? And you can just tell me about yourself.
All right.
Okay.
I write erotic novels, for children.
What?!
They're wildly unpopular.
Oh my God!
Oh also, you might be interested to know that I have a Ph.D.
Wow! You do?
Yeah, a Pretty Huge...
All right.
The sun'll come out...tomorrow! Bet...your bottom dollar that tomorrow... ...there'll be sun.
Hey!
Hey! Oh Joey, honey listen, thank you for talking to my yesterday about that thing with my boss. That really meant a lot.
Not a problem. Oh, and just so you know, that guy's not going to be bothering you about that baby thing anymore.
What?
Let's just say I took care of it.
Whoa-whoa-whoa, let's say more!
Don't worry! Don't worry. I just told him, very nicely, "You don't go buying people's babies, so back off!!"
What?!
What?!
No! No, no-no-no Joey he doesn't want to buy my baby! I made that up!
What?! Why?!
So that we would have something to talk about! So it wouldn't be awkward!
And you couldn't think of anything else?!
You said your boss wants to buy your baby?!
I can't believe that you yelled at my boss! I'm-I'm gonna lose my job! What am I going to do?!
You can always sell your baby.
Oh Joey, I can't believe you brought my boss into this! I'm gonna get fired!
You lied to me!
Well, she told me too!
Chandler has two copies of Annie!
Oh my God! Ross!!!
Hello!!
Ross, what are you doing?!
Not touching myself if that makes anyone less uncomfortable.
Morning. You wanted to see me?
Please, come in. Have a seat.
Okay look Mr. Zelner...
Oh I think it's best that I speak first.
Yeah.
I've asked Lee from human resources to be here as a witness to our conversation.
Oh God.
If I in any way implied that I wanted to buy your baby...I am sorry. Okay? Last week when I asked you when your due date was uh, I certainly did not mean that I felt that I was due your baby. Yeah, I want to be very clear that I understand that its your baby, and it is not mine to purchase.
Well, as long as we are clear about that.
Oh there it is.
That's not your regular dry cleaners.
I know, but that creep that I went on that date with goes to there so I have to find a new one. I also have to find a new video store, a new bank, a new adult bookstore, a new grocery store...
What?!
A new grocery store. The universe said I was going to meet a nice guy and that's what they gave me? When I get up there I'm going to kick some ass.
Don't worry Phoebe, you're gonna meet someone. If I can meet a great guy, so can you.
Yeah, we both can. And we both will.
Oh, you didn't have to come in with me.
Are you kidding? This is where they get out stains! Okay? This is like Disneyland for me. I'm-I'm gonna be over here watching the dance of the clean shirts.
Okay.
Oh, excuse me! I think you dropped s... Wow!
What?
I'm sorry, it's just that you're so incredibly beautiful.
Oh yeah well, I'm sorry about that too, but what are you going to do?
I hope you don't think I'm crazy but I feel like I was meant to pick this up, do you believe in that kind of thing?
A little. Now you're talking.
Would you like to go out and have a cup of coffee?
I-I-I'd love to. Let me just tell my friend.
Ooh, an ink stain! Hey, can I watch how you get this out?
She must've left.
Hi.
So? What-what-what happened?
It's all gonna be okay. They're just so happy that I'm not suing them that they gave me one extra month paid maternity leave. So long as I understand that the money should not construed as a down payment on this or any other child I should bear.
Wow, Ralph Lauren is really going out of there way to show they're not in the baby buying business.
Chandler, can you give us a minute?
Oh I'm sorry, you're kicking me out of my own living room?
Yeah.
I'll be in there.
Joey, I'm really sorry that I lied to you. I was just trying to make things...
I know. I know.
It kinda worked. I mean y'know, I don't know about you buy I haven't thought about our thing since all this.
Hey you're right. Yeah, it's kinda been like us again a little bit.
Yeah I know! I miss that.
Me too. I mean I...haven't thought at all about how I put myself out there and said all that stuff and how you didn't feel the same way about me and-and how it was really awkward.
My gynecologist tried to kill me.
Item J437-A, color: winterberry. Hi umm, listen come here, come in. I'm so-so sorry about yesterday. I-I'm really sorry. It's just that I...
Listen Ross, you don't have to apologize. I understand why you were there.
You do?
Yeah, you still have feelings for me. And-and to be honest, I-I still have feelings for you. And I wish that we can work it out Ross, but we can't. It's too complicated with you and Rachel and the baby, I-I just... It just wasn't meant to be.
Oh God you're right.
Ross, we...we have to be strong. Okay, I-I'm gonna go. Can I? To remember you?
No.
Oh, Ross, Mon, is it okay if I bring someone to your parent's anniversary party?
Yeah.
Sure. Yeah.
So, who's the guy?
Well, his name is Parker and I met him at the drycleaners.
Oooh, did he put a little starch in your bloomers? Who said that?
Yeah, he's really great though. He has this incredible zest for life, and he treats me like a queen, except at night when he treats me like the naughty girl I am.
Oh, by the way. Would it be okay if I gave the toast to mom and dad this year?
Uh, yeah, you sure you want to after what happened at their 20th?
Yeah, I'd really like to.
Okay, hopefully this time mom won't boo you.
Yes! Every year Ross makes the toast, and it's always really moving, and always makes them cry. Well this year I'm going to make them cry.
And you wonder why Ross is their favorite?
No! Really! Any time Ross makes a toast everyone cries, and hugs him, and pats him on the back and they all come up to me and say, "God, your brother." Know what they'll say this year? "God, you"
Well I can promise you, at least one person will be crying. I'm an actor, and any actor worth himself can cry on cue.
Really you can do that?
Are you kidding me? Watch! Well I can't do it with you guys watching me!
What are you doing?
Oh I'm working on my toast for the party, or as I like to call it. Sob fest 2002. Hey check this out.
It's a dog.
It's a dead dog. That's Chi-Chi; she died when I was in high school.
It's your parents' anniversary and you're going to talk about their dead pet?
The good stuff, huh?
Hi!
Hey!
Hey!
You got a present for my parents. That's so sweet.
Yeah, yeah, in honor of their 35th wedding anniversary, I had a star named after them.
Aww that is so cool.
And I got them a book on Karma Sutra for the elderly.
Hey, do you guys have any extra ribbon?
Yeah, sure. What do you need? We got lace, satin, sateen, raffia, gingham, felt, and I think my testacles may be in here too.
Aww! Chi-Chi! Oh, I loved this dog! Y'know Monica couldn't get braces because Chi-Chi needed knee surgery.
What?!
You were the 200-pound 11-year-old who rode her!
Hey!
Hi!
Everybody, this is Parker, Parker this is...
No, no, no wait! Don't tell me. Let me guess. Joey, Monica, Ross, Rachel and, I'm sorry Phoebe didn't mention you. Chandler, I'm kidding all ready you're my favorite!
Ha!
Why don't all of you tell me a little about your self?
Ah, actually, I'm sorry we-we probably should get going.
Classic Ross. Rachel, Rachel, oh how you glow. May I?
I, uh, think you already are.
Rachel, you have life growing inside you. Is there anything in this world more miraculous than-Oh a picture of a dog! Whose is this?
That's my old dog. He passed away years ago.
Oh well, at least you were lucky to have him. Bow-wow old friend, bow-wow. So where's the party?
It's out on the island. It's in Massapequa.
Maaaassapequa, Sounds Like A Magical Place. Tell Me About Massapequa, Is It Steep In Native American History?
Well, there is an Arby's in the shape of a tee-pee.
Okay, I got my note cards. Do you got the presents?
Yeah.
And I've got the car keys.
We're driving!?
Yeah.
Aces!
So uh, he seems like a nice guy.
Yeah, yeah I like him a lot.
Ya wanna hang back and take our own cab?
Yeah, otherwise I'm not going.
Hi.
Hi! Hey mom.
This is such a great party! 35 years. Very impressive, do you guys have any pearls of wisdom?
Jack?
Why would you serve food on such a sharp stick?
That's a good question, dad. That's a good question...
Hmmm....
Congratulations you two!
Thank you...we're so excited!
And also, congratulations on your wedding.
Wha-What?
Can we talk to you for just a y'know... It's just a little thing. Well we think it's absolutely marvelous that you're having this baby out of wedlock, some of our friends are less open-minded. Which is why we've told them all that you're married.
What?!
Thanks for going along with this.
Dad so what we have to pretend that we're married?
Son, I had to shave my ears for tonight. You can do this.
Can you believe that?
Yeah, if you're going to do the ears, you might as well take a pass at the nosal area.
No, us having to lie about being married.
No, I know I don't either, but ya know what, it's their party, and it's just one night. And we don't even have to lie; we just won't say anything. If it comes up again, we'll just...smile. We'll nod along.
Ross!
Rachel!
Hi Aunt Lisa, Uncle Dan.
Congratulations on the baby, and on the wedding!
Hmmmm....
Here's a little something to get you started.
Oh...
So, how's married life treating you?
Unbelievable!
We love marriage!
Great!
Hey.
Hey!
What a beautiful place. What a great night! I have to tell you, being here with all of you in Event Room C...I feel so lucky. I think of all the good times that have happened here. The birthdays, the proms, the mitzvahs both bar and bat, but none of them will compare with tonight! My God, I don't want to forget this moment! It's like I want to take a mental picture of you all! Click!
I don't think the flash went off.
Dahaaa! I'm going to find the men's room, be right back.
I'll go with you
Come on!
Somewhere there is someone with a tranquilizer gun and a huge butterfly net looking for that man.
I have to go to the bathroom too, but I don't want him complimenting my thing.
I'm so we weren't in the car! Did he ever let up?
He called the Long Island Expressway a concrete miracle.
This room! This night! That waiter! His shoes! I must take a mental picture! Ooh sorry...
Were you guys making fun of Parker?
That depends, how much did you hear?
So, he a little enthusiastic, what's wrong with that?
It's just that, it's so much.
Well, so what I like him! Do I make fun of the people you've dated? Tag, Janice, Mona? No, because friends don't do that. But, do you want my opinion? Do you want it? 'Cause in my opinion, your collective dating record reads like the who's who of human crap.
I feel terrible.
I know.
What was wrong with Mona?
Open it! Open it! Open it!
Yeah baby!
So we never got to hear about your wedding!
We were surprise that we weren't invited.
No, no, it was just our parents and 1 or 2 friends. It was a small wedding.
But it was beautiful. I mean it was small, but kind of spectacular.
Where did you have it?
On a cliff, in Barbados, at sunset, and Stevie Wonder sang Isn't She Lovely as I walked down the aisle.
Really?
Yeah, Stevie's an old family friend.
Oh my God. That sounds amazing. I would love to see pictures.
So would I. You wouldn't think that Annie Liebawitz would forget to put film in the camera.
Would you excuse us for a second? Umm.... what are you doing?
What? I'm not you. This may be the only wedding I ever have. I want it to be amazing.
Okay, okay. Ooooh, ooh maybe I rode in on a Harley.
Okay, Ross, it has to be realistic.
Are you okay? You seem kind of quiet.
No, I'm fine. I'm great. I'm with you.
And I'm with you! What a great time to be alive! Look at this plate-bouncy thing. What an inspired solution to man's plate dispensing problems.
Hm huh, yeah.
Ah! Oysters! Let me feed you one.
No, that's not necessary.
Please.
No, actually I don't eat...
I won't quit until you try.
Okay, fine! Fine! Mmm...hmmmmm....
What are they like? I've never had one.
Why don't you just try one?
No, they look too weird.
What are you doin'?
Just going over my toast. Those two will never know what hit 'em. I can't wait. They're going to be crying so hard. They're going to be fighting for breath.
Ya know if you want to, I can just hold them down and you could .
And my veil was lace, made by blind, Belgium nuns.
Blind?
Well, not at first, but it was very intricate work and they said even though they lost their sight, it was all worth it.
I'll bet you looked beautiful...
Well, I don't know about that, but some said that I looked like a floating angel.
So, how did you propose?
Oh yeah. That's a great story.
Well, um, actually, I-I took her to the planetarium. That's-that's where we had our first date. Um, she walked in and I had the room filled with lilies, her favorite flower...
Oh that is so sweet!
Shhh! I want to hear the rest!
Then, Fred Astaire singing The Way You Look Tonight came on the sound system, and the lights came down. And I got down on one knee and written across the dome in the stars were the words "Will you marry me?"
And the ring, was the size of my fist !
Yeah uh, Phoebe! Look umm, I want to apologize about before, okay? We were being jerks. Parker's a nice guy and I'd like to get to know him.
Then you better do it now.
Why?
Because I'm going to kill him
What-what?
You guys were right. He's just too excited about...everything. I mean I'm all for living life, but this is the Geller's 35th anniversary. Okay? Let's call a spade a spade this party stinks.
I know I'm having the worst time. There was a 15-minute line for the buffet, and when I finally got up to the plates, I slipped on a giant booger!
Are you sure it wasn't an oyster?
I guess it could've been, I didn't really look at it. Y'know, I just wiped it on Chandler's coat and got the hell out of there.
He's just such a great guy I'm so excited about him.
Oh hey, you should be excited about him. There's nothing wrong with him he's a good guy.
You think?
Yeah. Ya know what I think; I think we were all just being too negative.
You're right. You're right, he's just embracing life. We could all stand to be a little more like Parker. You know what? I am like him! I'm a sunny, positive person.
Actually, you have a little bit of an edge.
What's that now?
Nothing...
Oh look it's Parker!
Look! It's the bunny hop!
Oooh I love it!
You do?!
Are you kidding? People acting like animals to music. Come on!
Okay it's time for the toast! Umm now-now, I know that Ross usually gives the toast, but this year I'm going to do it.
No, no it's going to be great. Really! Mom, Dad, when I got married, one of the things that made me sure I could do it was the amazing example the two of you set for me. For that and so many other things I want to say thank you. I know I probably don't say it enough, but I love you. When I look around this room, I'm-I'm saddened by the thought of those who could not be here with us. Nana, my beloved grandmother who would so want to be here, but she can't because she's dead. As is our dog Chi-Chi. I mean look how cute she is. . Was. Do me a favor and pass this to my parents. Remember she's dead. Okay, her and Nana, gone. Wow! Hey does anybody remember when Debra Winger had to say goodbye to her children in Terms of Endearment? Didn't see that? No movie fans?! You want to hear something sad? The other day I was watching 60 Minutes these orphans in Romania, who have been so neglected, they were incapable of love. You people are made of stone! Here's to mom and dad! Whatever!
Thank you Monica that was uh, interesting. Wasn't it interesting, Jack?
Why don't I remember this dog?
Ross, why don't you give us your toast now?
Oh, no, Mom, it's just Monica this year.
You're not going to say anything? On our 35th wedding anniversary?
No, of course, Um... Um, everybody? Um, I-I just wanted to say...on behalf of my new bride, Rachel , and myself. Umm, that if...if in 35 years, we're half as happy as you guys are, we'll count ourselves the luckiest people in the world.
Oh Ross...
I just wish Nana were alive to hear Ross's toast.
My God what a fantastically well lit hallway!
Can I get you something to drink? Like a water and Valium?
I must say this apartment, its, its, There are no words...
Oh thank God.
It's a haven. A third-floor paradise. A modern-day Eden in the midst...
Yeah? I know! I know! Uh huh? Listen why don't we just um, sit and relax? You know just be with each other. Quietly!
That sounds great. My God this is the most comfortable couch I've ever sat on in my entire life.
Let's try something else, let's play a game.
I love games!
Shocking! Let's play the game of who can stay quiet the longest.
Or...Jenga.
But, let's play this one first. And remember whoever talks first loses!
I lose, now Jenga.
Oh my God! Oh my God!
Is something wrong?
Wrong? Really? You know the word wrong. Everything isn't perfect? Everything isn't magical? Everything isn't a glow with the light of a million fairies? They were just brake lights, Parker!
Well, excuse me for putting a good spin on a traffic jam!
You don't have to put a good spin on everything.
I'm sorry that's who I am. I'm a positive person.
No! I am a positive person. You are like Santa Clause on Prozac, at Disneyland, getting laid!
So what do you want me to do, you want me to be more negative, less happy?
Much less happy!
Fine! Well then to quote Ross, "I'd better be going."
So long! Don't let the best door in the world hit you in the ass on your way out!
Isn't this the most incredible fight you've ever had in your entire life?
Uh huh.
...and then, we could've gone from the ceremony to the reception with you in the sidecar!
Ross, it just wouldn't have been feasible.
But having a dove place the ring on your finger would've been no problem?
It was really fun being married to you tonight.
Yeah! And! And, it was the easiest 400 bucks I've ever made.
Okay Ross, can I uh, can I ask you something?
Yeah.
That proposal, at the planetarium...
I know, I know it was stupid.
Are you kidding?! With the, with the lilies, and-and the song, and the stars! It was...really wonderful! Did you just make that up?
No, actually I thought about it when, when we were going out. It's how I imagined I uh, I would ask you to marry me.
Well, that would've been very hard to say no too.
It's a good thing I didn't do it, because it sounds like it would've been a very expensive wedding. Okay, good night.
Goodnight.
Even if the sidecar had a windscreen so your hair wouldn't get messed up?
I will think about it.
That's all I'm askin'.
Okay that's it. I give up. At mom and dad's 40th anniversary, you're the one giving the speech.
Y'know I don't understand why they didn't cry. It was a beautiful speech.
Oh, come on.
Hey! All that stuff you said about true love, you were right, I mean, we did learn a lot from Mom and Dad! And that picture of Chi-Chi with her mischievous grin. And what you said about Nana. Ohh, yeah she really would've wanted to be there. And you know what? I think she was.
Oh good God, Ross! How the hell do you do it?
Hi!
Hey!
Hey!
So, I'm in my apartment doing the Soap Opera Digest crossword puzzle, and guess who the clue is for three down.
Three down, Days Of Our Lives star blank Tribbiani. That's me!! I'm blank!!
How cool is this?! We know three down! I'm touching three down!
Yeah you are baby.
Three down knows I'm married, what's three down doin'?
So did they call you to tell you your name's gonna be in this?
No. They really like me over there. They want to do a big profile on me, but I said no.
Why'd you say no?
Remember what happened the last time I did an interview for them? I said I write a lot of my own lines, and then the writers got mad and made my character fall down the elevator shaft. So who knows what I might say this time.
If only there was something in your head to control the things you say.
Oh, come on Joey! You will totally keep it in check this time, and plus y'know the publicity would be really good for your career! And you deserve that! And if you do the interview you can mention, oh I don't know, gal pal Rachel Green?
Is that gal pal spelled L-O-S-E-R?
Okay, don't listen to him. Please?
Fine! All right, I'll do it. But hey! You guys have to be at the next table so you can stop me if I y'know, start to say something stupid.
Just then or-or all the time, 'cause we-we have jobs y'know.
Come on! We will be there for you the whole time! Just remember gal pal Rachel Green. Ha-ha! I'm gonna be in Soap Opera Digest! And not just in the dumb crossword puzzle. Seriously, proud of you.
Yeah.
I really appreciate you taking the time to do this.
Oh, not at all. Happy to do it.
You think we're being obvious?
No, we're just four people with neck problems. You talk like this.
Y'know I think its great you wanted to meet here. Y'know when most people hear the magazine is paying for it they want to go to a big fancy restaurant.
Actually, I didn't know the magazine was paying for it. Wouldn't have mattered, I'm doing this for the fans, not for the free food.
Can I get you anything?
Umm, I'll have a cup of coffee.
And I'll have all the muffins.
Hey!
Shhh! We're not talking.
Oh. Finally! Oh.
So, according to your bio, you've done quite a bit of work before Days of Our Lives. Anything you're particularly proud of?
All you want is a dingle/What you envy's a schwang/A thing through which you can tinkle/Or play with, or simply let hang...
Folks, has this ever happened to you. You go to the refrigerator to get a nice glass of milk, and these darn cartons are so flingin'-flangin' hard to open.
Oh, you said it Mike. Aw! There's got to be a better way!
And there is Kevin.
This is the first time he's ever used this product, he's never used this product before, you're gonna see how easy this is to do. Go ahead. This works with any milk carton.
Wow, it is easy. Now, I can have milk everyday.
So this is it? Victor?
Yeah, I guess it is. And so... I'm gonna get on this spaceship, and I'm gonna go to Blargon 7 in search of alternative fuels. But when I return, 200 years from now, you'll be long gone. But I won't have aged at all. So you tell your great-great-granddaughter to look me up, because Adrienne... baby...I'm gonna want to meet her.
Shh, OK, here I come, here I come. See I'm comin' to fix the copier, I can't get to the copier, I'm thinkin' what do I do, what do I do...so I just watch 'em have sex. And then I say, wait, here's my line, you know that's bad for the paper tray.
Nice work my friend.
Thank you. Wait-wait-wait-wait, you see me again. Hang on, the guy's butt's blockin' me. There I am, there I am, there I am, there I am, there I am...
Well, there are so many things, it's hard to pick just one.
I'm gonna get some coffee, anyone want anything?
Oh yeah, I'd actually love a blueberry muffin and a chamomile tea.
Uh, double latte, extra foam.
And a bagel with only...
I was just being polite!
Okay, how about when you're not working. What do you do in your spare time?
Look at this clown! Just because he's got a bigger boat he thinks he can take up the whole river. Get out of the way jackass! Who names their boat Coast Guard anyway?
That is the Coast Guard.
What are they doing out here? The coast's all the way over there.
Hey!
Hey! Check it out! This is unbelievable! Joey has been holding his breath for almost four minutes!
Dude! What are yo-you trying to kill me?!
Well, I see you've had a very productive day. Don't you think the cowboy hat is a little much?
Come on, it's fun!
All right! Isn't this a woman's hat?
Dude, stop talking crazy and make us some tea!
Y'know what, we have to turn off the porn.
I think you're right.
All right, ready?
One.
Two.
Three.
That's kinda nice.
Yeah, that's kinda a relief.
Yeah.
You wanna see if we still have it?
Yeah.
FREE PORN!!!
Yeah!!
We have free porn here!!!
In my spare time I uh, read to the blind. And I'm also a mento for the kids. Y'know a mento, a role model.
A mento...
Right.
Like the candy?
Matter of fact, I do.
Well umm, another thing our readers always want to know is how our soap stars stay in such great shape. Do you have some kind of fitness regime?
Uh, we stars just try to eat right and get lots of exercise.
Wow! You realize that we've been throwing this ball, without dropping it, for like an hour?
Are you serious?!
Yeah. I realized it about a half-hour ago but I didn't want to say anything 'cause I didn't want to jinx it.
Wow! We are pretty good at this!
Yeah!
Hey! We totally forgot about lunch!
Oh, I-I, I think that's the first time I ever missed a meal! Yeah, my pants are a little loose!
What's wrong with you?
Nothing! Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, haven't been able to stand up since. But um, I don't think it's anything serious.
This sounds like a hernia. You have to-you-you-Go to the doctor!
No way! 'Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything it's gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach! Why did I have to start working out again? Damn you 15s!
It's a trifle. It's got all of these layers. First there's a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam, then custard, which I made from scratch. Then raspberries, more ladyfingers, then beef sauted with peas and onions, then a little more custard, and then bananas, and then I just put some whipped cream on top!
It tastes like feet!
I like it.
Are you kidding?
What's not to like? Custard? Good. Jam? Good. Meat? Goooooood.
The fridge broke. I have to eat everything. Cold cuts, ice cream, limes-Hey, what was in that brown jar?
That's still in there?!
Not anymore.
Oh! Yay! Look! There's a piece that doesn't have floor on it!
Stick to your side!
Hey, come on now!
All right, what are we havin'?
Uhh, I don't believe in these crazy diets y'know, just everything in moderation.
Your muffins.
I'll take those to go. For the kids.
Oh, I know what I wanted to ask you. You were on the show years ago and then they killed you off. What happened there?
It was so stupid, I said some stuff in an interview that I shouldn't have said. But believe me, that's not gonna happen today.
Understood. So, what'd you say back then?
Well, I said that I...
You guys, this is Shelley, she's interviewing me for Soap Opera Digest, and Shelley, this are my friends...
Hi! I'm gal pal Rachel Green, and if you want the dirt, I'm the one you come too. This might be Joey's baby , who knows? I'm just kidding-Seriously, gal pal Rachel Green.
Who just lost the respect of her unborn child.
Umm, I'm gonna just go get this warmed up.
Okay.
Joey! You're doing great!
Yeah, so far nothing stupid.
Mento?
No thanks.
So, as Joey's friends, is there anything that you guys think our readers ought to know?
Uh no, no just-just that he is a great guy.
Yeah, that's gonna get you into Soap Opera Digest. Well I......I would just like to say that Joey truly has enriched the days of our lives.
Umm, I...I just think you don't expect someone so hot to be so sweet.
Oh! I like that. What's your name?
Umm, Phoebe Buffay.
How do you spell that? So we can get it right.
Oh okay, it's P as in Phoebe, H as in hoebe, O as in oebe, E as in ebe, B as in bee-bee and E as in 'Ello there mate!
Great! Well, it was nice meeting all of you.
Yeah, you too.
You too!
Thanks.
Bye.
So it seems like you have a lot of friends, who would you say is your best friend?
How come you have two?
Well this one's for you.
Get out.
No, I can't. No-no, listen, I, I know how much this means to you and I also know that this is about more than just jewelry, it's about you and me and the fact that we're best buds.
Wow, is this friendship? I think so. Check it out, we're bracelet buddies.
That's what they'll call us.
Oh, Joey! Sorry!
No that's all right. Don't worry about it.
Oh but look! That's gonna leave a stain!
Rach! Hey! It's fine! You're at Joey's!
Really?
Yeah! Look!
I've never lived like this before.
I know.
All right, don't waste it, I mean its still food.
All right I've been feeling incredibly guilty about this, because I wanna be a good friend, and damnit I am a good friend. So just, just shut up and close your eyes.
Wow, you are a good friend, 'course the audition was this morning, and I didn't get it. But that was a hell of a kiss. Rachel is a very lucky girl.
All right. Let's get the contestants out of their isolation booths. And they're off!
Get your foot off my contestant! Judge!
Judge rules, no violation.
Ohhh.
And the duck gets the Nutter-Butter!
No!! Hey-hey that's not a Nutter-Butter, that's just an old Wonton!
Judge rules, Nutter-Butter.
Ohh, tough call.
Yeah.
I'd seen this thing on The Discovery Channel...
Wait a minute! I saw that! On The Discovery Channel, yeah! About jellyfish and how if you... Ewwww!! You peed on yourself?!
Ewwww!!
You can't say that!! You-you don't know!! I mean I thought I was gonna pass out from the pain! Anyway I-I tried, but I-I couldn't...bend that way. So...
Ewwww!!
That's right I stepped up! She's my friend and she needed help! And if I had too, I'd pee on anyone of you!
Umm, no. No best friend, no. Just a lot of close friends.
So umm, now back to the show. How does it feel to have a huge gay fan base?
Really? Me? Wow! I don't even know any huge gay people!
It hurts me. It physically hurts me.
Now, off the record, you're not...
What? Are you referring to my man's bag? At first, I thought it just looked good, but it's practical too. Check it out! It's got compartments for all your stuff! Your wallet! Your keys! Your address book!
Your make-up!
Okay. Now-now-now should I climb down your front so we're face to face or-or should I climb down your back so we're-we're butt to face.
I think face to face.
I would say that.
Face to face, yeah!
Okay, here I go.
All right.
Oh my... How much do you weigh Ross?!
I prefer not to answer that right now, I'm still carrying a little holiday weight.
Y'know, when we talked about face to face, I don't think we thought it all the way through.
Hey Pheebs!
Hey!
Check it out. How much of a man am I?!
Wow! Nice! Manly and also kind of a slut.
You're turning into a woman.
No I'm not. Why would you say that? That's just mean.
Now I've upset you? What did I say?
It's not what you said. It's the way you said it... Oh My God, I'm a woman!!!
Great nap.
It really was.
Uh me? Gay? No! No. No, but I have a number of close friends who are.
So, let's talk about women. I'm sure our female readers will be interested to know about your romantic life.
Oh-oh-oh-oh, how I do it is, I look a woman up and down and say, "Hey, how you doin'?"
Oh, please!
Hey, how you doin'?
Hey! How you doin'?
He has the most amazing Porsche under there!
I'd love to show ya, but I just tucked her in. She's sleeping. Hey uh, would you two girls like to go for a drink?
Hi, is Rachel here? I'm her sister.
Oh my God, Jill!
Oh my God, Rachel!
Oh my God, introduce us!
This is Chandler.
Hi!
And you know Monica and Ross!
Hi Jill.
And that's Phoebe , and that's Joey.
Hey, how you doin'?
Don't!!
No! I mean you're a really nice guy and I'm happy to be your roommate and your friend, I'm just y'know, I just don't feel that way about you.
Oh! I see what happened. It's because I was trying to repel you. Right? Believe me, you'd feel a lot different if I turned it on.
I don't think so.
Oh, I do. How you doin?
I'm okay.
What?!?! Oh dear God!
Not much to tell there I'm really shy.
So, that's it. I guess that's all I need. Thank you so much. I think they will be running this in the beginning of next month.
Oh great! Great! Thank you.
Bye.
Bye-bye. I did it!
Yeah!
Amazing! Amazing!
Oh wait! I almost forgot. We have to ask everybody this. Other than Days of Our Lives, what's your favorite soap opera?
Oh, I don't watch soap operas. Excuse me, I have a life, y'know?
Thank you. The readers at Soap Opera Digest will be happy to hear that.
Oh, good to know. So close!
Wow! I can't believe they didn't put it in the part where you said you didn't watch soap operas.
Yeah, I called the lady about that. I told her I was just joking. She was pretty nice about that.
You slept with her didn't you?
Little bit, yeah.
Wow! This picture of you sure is steamy.
Oh yeah, that's just a little something for my huge gay fan base.
Did you just wink at me?
Hey, you're the one that loves the picture.
Hi!
Hey!
Hey!
So what's the final head count on my baby shower?
About twenty, a couple people from work who had something else to do.
Also both of your sisters called and neither can make it.
What?! You mean they're not coming to a social event where there's no men and there's no booze?! That's shocking! I don't care, as long as my mom's here.
Oh my God, your mother!
What?! My mom's not gonna be here?!
Well, given that we forgot to invite her it would be an awfully big coincidence if she was.
My God!
Well it wasn't my fault, Phoebe was in charge of the invitations!
Well I don't, I don't have a mother so often I forget that other people...
Oh give it a rest!
So my mother is not coming to my baby shower?!
No. Neither is mine.
Okay, y'know what? Don't worry, okay? We'll take care of it. We'll call her. Just go home and get ready.
Please, make sure she comes. It's really important to me, I mean it's my mom!
I know. I know, what's her number?
I don't know.
Go! I have it in my book. Go! Wait a minute! If you're in charge of the invitations why am I the one who has to call her-Hello Mrs. Green! Hi, it's Monica Geller.
Oh, hello Monica.
Hi, umm I know this is last minute, but we've decided to throw an impromptu baby shower for Rachel today.
I know, my daughter's told me about it when they received their impromptu invitations a month ago.
Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm-I'm so sorry.
For what dear? For not inviting me or lying about it?
Oh my God, my ass is sweating! Please! Please! Can you come? It's today at four.
Well all right. I'll see you at four.
Thank you.
Isn't it at three?
Son of a bitch!
Hey Joe! You wanna shoot some hoops?
Oh no, I can't go. I'm practicing; I got an audition to be the host of a new game show.
Oh cool!
That's great.
Yeah-yeah, and if I get it by day I'll Dr. Drake Remoray, but by night I'll be Joey Trrrribbiani!
You'll be perfect for this! That's already your name!
But the audition's in a couple hours and I don't even understand the game.
Well do you want some help?
Oh really? That'd be great! You guys can be the contestants!
Awesome!
Okay, I guess we can lose to junior high girls some other time.
All right! Let's play Bamboozled!
Bamboozled?
Yeah, isn't that a cool name?
Yeah!
No!
All right. Uhh, okay. Our first contestant is Ross Geller. Why don't you tell us a little something about you Ross?
Well uh, I-I'm a paleontologist. Umm, I-I live in New York. I have a son Ben. Uh, hi Ben! And uh...
I said a little bit Ross. Now, how about you Chandler?
Well Joey, I'm a headhunter. I hook up out of work Soviet scientists with rogue third-world nations. Hi Rasputin!
Excellent! Let's play Bamboozled! Chandler, you'll go first. What is the capital of Columbia?
Bogota.
It's Ba-go-ta, but close enough. Now, you can either pass your turn to Ross or pick a Wicked Wango card.
What does a Wicked Wango card do?
I should know that. Let's see, just one moment please. Umm, here we are, a Wicked Wango card determines whether you go higher or lower.
Higher or lower than what?
This is embarrassing.
Can you believe how lame this is?
I'm sorry, I don't believe contestants are allowed to talk to each other.
Oh, I told the stripper to be here at five. That's good right?
You ordered a stripper for the shower?! That is totally inappropriate!
What? He's gonna be dressed as a baby! Oh hi Mrs. Green!
Hi!
I'm so glad you could make it.
Yes, thank you so much. And again, we're so sorry. We could not feel worse about it.
Try. There's my little girl.
She's still mad.
Yeah I know. Isn't it great? One less person we have to make small talk with.
Phoebe, Sandra's mad at you too. It-it doesn't bother you?
No look, we've apologized twice! I can't do anymore than that. I know you hate it when people are mad at you but you just have to be okay with it.
Okay. I can do that. I gotta go powder my ass.
Look at that face! Just like when you were in high school! If I didn't know better I'd say you were a cheerleader in trouble. Come on, let's get some tea.
Okay.
Oh my look at that. Only three weeks to go, now have you picked your nanny yet? Now I don't want you to use your housekeeper 'cause it would just split her focus.
Oh well actually gonna use a nanny and uh, I don't even have a housekeeper.
It's like you're a cave person. Rachel, you must get a nanny. You don't know how overwhelming this is going to be. I mean when you were a baby I had full time help, I had Mrs. Kay.
Mrs. Kay! Oh yeah, she was sweet. She taught me Spanish. I actually think I remember some of it, tu madre es loca.
Such a sweet woman.
Well, however great she was I just can't afford that.
Oh Rachel!
What?
I just had the greatest idea! I'm gonna come live with you!
Wh-wh-what? What?
Oh, I'm so happy I'm gonna do this for my little girl. Aw, look at you. You have tears in your eyes.
Yes. Yes I do.
All right Ross you're in the lead, would you like to take another question or spin the Wheel of Mayhem?
The wheel has not been my friend tonight Joey. Uh, I'll take another question.
Okay, this is gonna be tough. Hold your breath.
It's okay, I'm ready.
No dude, you gotta hold your breath until you're ready to answer the question.
This is ridiculous, he's not gonna hold his breath...
Okay, what do you have a fear of if you suffer from this phobia, Tris...Holy cow, that's a big word. Trisc... Seriously look at this thing. Chandler, how do you say that?
Let me see that.
This one right here.
Triscadecaphobia.
The fear of Triscuts!
No! No, fear of the number 13.
Fear of Triscuts?
It's possible, they have really sharp edges.
All right Chandler, you're up.
Wait a minute, I-I believe I'm entitled to use my Angel Pass for a free turn?
This game makes no sense!
Y'know what? You're just upset because you're losing.
Oh come on Ross, I think we're all losers here.
All right. Chandler, you can either spin the wheel or pick a Google card.
Let me think. Let me think-Oh! I don't care.
You-you must choose Mr. Bing.
Either, it makes no difference.
Choose, you jackass!
I'll take a card.
Okay, you picked the Gimmie card! You get all of Ross's points!
What?!
This game is kinda fun.
You don't think it's a little crazy that you get all my points just 'cause you...
I don't think the contestants are supposed to speak to each other.
Why did you invite my mother?!
What?
She wants to move in with me and Ross to help take care of the baby.
For how long?
Eight weeks. I mean I love my mother, but my God, a long lunch with her is taxing.
I personally would be honored if she wanted to live with me.
She can't hear you.
What? You guys, come on! What am I going to do?
Well, if you don't want your mother to move in with you, just tell her.
You're right. You're right. I mean I'm about to have a baby, I can tell my mother that I don't want her to just be sleeping on my couch! Oh my God! She's gonna want to sleep in my bed with me. This cannot happen!
That's right. That is right, you go over there and tell her you don't want her to live with you. Do not take no for an answer!
Okay.
This is great! Now she's gonna be mad at Rachel! Y'know what? And I'm just gonna swoop in there and be like the daughter she never had.
I have new respect for Chandler. All right everybody! It's time to open the presents!
Yes! Yes! And I think that the first gift that Rachel opens should be from the grandmother of the baby, because you're the most important person in this room. And in the world!
Well uh, I don't have a gift because I wasn't invited until the last minute, but thank you so much for bringing that to everyone's attention.
How about you less important people, let's open your presents!
Mom that's okay that you didn't get you a gift!
Well, I kinda did. Me. Eight weeks of me.
Oh yeah. Okay, see mom, the truth is I can do this on my own.
Sweetheart I know you're gonna be terrific mom, I just think you need a little help, especially at the beginning.
But mom, I really know what I'm doing. I can handle this.
Really? Remember Twinkles?
He was a hamster! I am not going to vacuum up my baby!
Okay, come on Rach it's present time! Y'know you're the glue that's holding this whole party together. It's kinda falling apart here.
Oh look.
Wow!
Okay, this is from your friend at work.
Oh my gosh! Oh wow! Oh, I know what this is! Wait a minute. That can't be right. Is that a beer bong for a baby?
Darling, that's a breast pump!
Did I say I was done guessing? Okay, thank you for that. Oh wow! What's this?
It's a diaper genie.
Oh, it dispenses clean diapers!
No! It's where you put the dirty ones!
Well that's gross, why don't you just take it outside and throw it in a dumpster?
Oh you're gonna do that ten times a day?
What?! It goes ten times a day! What are we feeding this baby?! Indian food?!
No dear, that's what babies do.
Rachel, listen to your mother. She is very smart.
Plus, what are you planning on doing with the baby while you're trotting out to the garbage ten times a day?
I don't know, I'd leave it on the changing table? What?! What'd I do? What'd I do?!
You can't leave a baby alone!
Oh come--Of course I know that. I mean of course you never leave a baby alone! I mean who would-she wouldn't be safe as she would be with me, the baby dummy. Oh God, okay. Y'know what? I think opening the presents right now is a little overwhelming right now. So I think umm, I'm just gonna maybe open them a little bit later, but thank you all for coming. And for these beautiful gifts, and this basket is beautiful.
It's actually a bassinet.
Okay mommy, don't ever leave me.
In what John Houston film would you hear this line, "Badges? We don't need no stinkin' badges!"
Treasure of the Sierra Madre!
Correct! There's a possible backwards bonus!
Madre Sierra the of Treasure!
Yes!
I'd like to go up the ladder of chance to the golden mud hut please.
Wise choice, how many rungs?
Six!
That noise can only me one thing.
Hungry monkey.
Hungry monkey! Haaa! I'd like a Wicked Wango card!
Okay, it's an audio question, name this television theme song.
Oh. Oh! Oh my God! Okay, I know this, give me-give me a second!
Tell it to the Time Turtle!
Shut up! I Dream of Genie!
Yes! Yes, you're back in the lead!
I'd like to spin the wheel!
Oh come on!!
All right! All right! Uh, umm, Super-Speedy Speed round!
Is there a hopping bonus?
Of course!
Who invented bifocals?
Ben Franklin.
Correct! Which monarch has ruled Great Britain the longest?
Queen Victoria.
Correct again! But, you forgot to switch legs between questions, so no hopping bonus!
Noooo!!! Every time!!!
Now, over to Chandler.
I'd like a Google Card.
Are you sure?
Yes! No! Google!
Oh my God! Congratulations Ross, because Chandler, you've been Bamboozled!
Nooo!!
Yeah!!
This is the best game ever!!!
So umm, you're gonna stay with me as long as I need you?
Of course I am!
Oh mom, I swear I'm not an idiot. I've read all kinds of books on pregnancy and giving birth, but I-I just didn't think to read the part about what to do when the baby comes. And-and then guess what? The baby's coming and I don't know what to do. Oh, can I throw up in my diaper genie?
No. Sweetie, you're gonna be fine.
Wait-wait where are you going? Where are you going?
I'm going to the bathroom.
Okay.
Now don't worry! Everything's gonna be okay.
It is going to be okay! It was worth a shot.
Hey!
Hey! Why are you all red and sweaty?
I just Bamboozled Chandler! Which is not uh sexual thing. That was a quick shower.
Not if you were here.
Wow! It looks like we got a lot of good stuff.
Oh we did, but my mom got us the greatest gift of all.
A Play-Dough Barber Shop?
No. She's going to live with us for eight weeks.
Uh, what?
Yes! She's gonna help us take care of the baby! Woo-hoo.
What-You're not serious. I mean she's a very nice woman, but there is no way we can take eight weeks of her. She'll drive us totally crazy.
Hi Ross!
Hi roomie!
Hey Joey, hi! I'm Ray; I'm the producer of the show.
It's a pleasure to meet you Ray.
And this is Duncan and Erin, they're gonna help us out with the audition. So uh, let's get the camera rolling.
Rightie-O Ray!
Whenever you're ready.
Hello, I'm Joey Tribbiani! Let's play Bamboozled! Erin, you get the first question! In hockey, who is known as The Great One?
Wayne Gretzky.
Correct! Now, would you like to pick a Wicked Wango card or spin the Wheel of Mayhem?
Uh Joey, didn't your agents give you the revised rules? We've eliminated all of that. No wheel, no cards.
What-Why?!
Uh well, the game was too complicated and research showed people didn't follow it.
Well what's complicated? You spin the Wheel of Mayhem to go up the Ladder of Chance. You go past the Mud Hut through the Rainbow Ring to get to the Golden Monkey; you yank his tail and boom! You're in Paradise Pond!
Yeah all that's gone. It's basically just a simple question and answer game now.
Well what's fun about that? You expect me to be the host of a boring game that's just people standing around answering questions?
Well, there'll be women in bikinis holding up the scores.
Let's play Bamboozled!
...and all those dinosaur nick-knacks you have Ross, I thought they might be more at home in the garage.
Well we...we don't have a garage.
Did I say garage? I meant garbage.
Y'know what? Maybe, Mrs. Green, it's not absolutely vital that you live with us.
Well Rachel needs help with the baby.
I do. I really do. I don't know anything.
I'm-I'm sure that's not true.
Oh no? Pheebs? Monica? Do I know anything about babies?
No, not a thing.
It's frightening.
Well uh, y'know what? Even if she doesn't know anything, I do! I have a son. And his mother and I didn't live together, and whenever he was with me I took care of him all the time, by myself.
That's true. You do have another child.
Yeah.
With another woman. Have you no control Ross?
That's a different issue. Uh, the point is, when the baby comes I will be there to...to feed her and bathe her and change her. And more than that I want to do all those things.
Well then you really don't need me to live with you.
Yes! Yes, you're gonna be so missed.
You're gonna be a great father.
Well you're gonna be a wonderful grandma.
Hello?! I still don't know what the hell I'm doing!
Oh, come on, every first time mother feels that way. You'll-you're gonna pick it up. Hey! You will! Uh look, y'know when you first came to the city? You were this spoiled helpless little girl who-who still used daddy's credit card. Do you remember?
I hope you're going somewhere with this.
Look at you! What-You're-you're this big executive! You are much more capable than you give yourself credit for. I-I have no doubt you're gonna be an incredible mother.
Really?
I'm telling you.
Thank you.
All right you two, I'm gonna get going.
Oh.
Oh no-no-no-no sweetheart, you stay put. I'll let myself out. It's like I'm not here, which I almost wasn't.
You're still so funny. You're so funny. What do I do?
Nothing! You have apologized to her like a million times and she's been nothing but terrible to you. And don't forget you just threw her daughter a lovely, albeit slightly boring, shower, and she hasn't even thanked you for it.
Y'know what? You're-you're right.
Yeah I mean if you want to say anything to her, I'd tell her off.
Really?
Uh-huh!
Okay! I will! Mrs. Green? Mrs. Green! It is rude to leave a party without saying good-bye to the host! Yeah, and-and also when someone apologizes to you the decent thing to do is to accept it! Now what I did to you, it wasn't on purpose! But what you're during to me now is just plain spiteful!
Spiteful?!
That's right! Maybe it's time you took a good hard look at a mirror young lady...old lady...lady!
Wrap it up, wrap it up, wrap it up...
So whenever you're ready to apologize to me, I will forgive you. Good day! I can't feel my legs!
You were fantastic! I'm so proud of you!
Yeah? I'm proud of me too.
You should be!
Yeah could-could-could you get me something to drink?
You got it!
Okay. Mrs. Green! Okay I'm really sorry!! I'm apologizing for the- Okay, I bit my tongue, but I'm still really sorry!
Okay! I'm ready.
You sure?
Yes, I've done my studying and I really know my stuff.
All right then. Rachel Green! Let's play Bamboozled! How do you test the temperature of the baby's bath water?
Uh, put your elbow in it.
Excellent! How do you put a baby down for a nap?
Full, dry, on its back, and no loose covers.
That's correct! This is an audio question, what do you do when the baby makes this sound?
Check if it's wet, check if it's hungry, burp it!
Excellent! Excellent, now-now do you want another question or a Wicked Wango card?
A card! A card! I pick a card!
Oh, I'm sorry you've been Bamboozled! You're gonna be a terrible mother! I've lost sight of why we're doing this!
Hey you guys I got some bad news.
Well that's no way to sell newspapers. Why don't you try, "Extra! Extra! Read all about it!"
No, Monica's restaurant got a horrible review in the Post. I didn't want her to see it, so I ran around the neighborhood and bought all the copies I could find.
Man, this is bad! And I've had my share of bad reviews. I still remember my first good one though. "Everything else in this production of Our Town was simply terrible. Joey Tribbiani was abysmal."
Hey!
Hey.
Oh my God! Look at all the newspapers! It must be a good review! Is it great?!
Umm...
Oh dear God!
But the good news is, no one in a two-block radius will ever know.
What about the rest of Manhattan?!
Yeah, they all know.
Oh my God, this is horrible!
I'm so sorry.
I'm so humiliated!
Yeah but y'know what they say Mon, "There's no such thing as bad press."
You don't think that umm, "The chef's Mahi Mahi was awful awful," is bad press?
I didn't write it.
Is he right? Am I really-Am I awful?
No!
Yeah! Yeah Monica! You listen to me, okay? And I'm not just saying this because I'm your friend, I'm sayin' it 'cause it's the truth. You're food is abysmal!
Ross!
What?! What?
I am freaking out!
Are ya?
My due date is in one week!
What are you doing up?
That is seven days!
Okay look, I had a lot of water before I went to bed. Can we do this after...
No-no-no-no-no Ross! Please, come on we do not have any of the big stuff we need! We do not a changing table! We do not have a crib! We do not have a diaper service!
It's funny you should mention diapers.
I'm serious.
Okay look, there's nothing to worry about. We have plenty of time. There's a great baby furniture store on west 10th. Tomorrow, we will go there and we will get you everything that you need. Okay?
Okay. Thank you. That's great. Thank you. Wait-wait! Where on west 10th? Because there's this really cute shoe store that has like this little...
Okay. Okay. If uh, if you're gonna do this, then I'm gonna do that. So...
Oh, wait Ross! I'm sorry, one more thing!
Yeah!
Umm, our situation. Y'know umm, what we mean to each other. And I mean we-we're having this baby together, and we live together. Isn't that, isn't that weird?
Well uh...
I'm just kidding! You can go pee!
Joey! Now that you're here...
Sure, I can hang out 'til I have to meet ya. What uh-How come you're not going?
I have a job interview I have to get ready for.
I thought you already have a job.
And people say you don't pay attention. No, this is a much better job. It's vice-president of a company that does data reconfiguration and statistical factoring for other companies.
Wow! How do you know how to do that?!
That's what I do now.
Hey Joey, come taste this.
What is it?
Remember that guy that gave me a bad review? Well... I'm getting my revenge!
You cooked him?
No. He Teaches A Course On Food Criticism At The New School, So Before We Go To The Movies I Wanna Go By There And Make Him Try My Bouillabaisse Again. Oh, I Cannot Wait To Read The Front Page Of The Post Tomorrow! "Restaurant Reviewer Admits I was wrong about Monica."
The front page? You really do live in your own little world, don't ya?
Do you uh, want these things delivered Mr. and Mrs. Geller?
Oh.
Oh.
No-no-no! No, no, no, we're not married.
We are having a baby together, but we're not involved. I mean, uh we-we were seeing each other a while ago, but then we were just friends. And then there was one drunken night. Or, yes stranger, we'd like this delivered please.
Why don't you fill out this address card.
Oh, okay.
I notice you picked out a lot of our dinosaur items.
Oh yeah! Actually, that's one of the reasons why we're not a couple.
I chose those, I'm a paleontologist.
Really?! That is so cool!
Oh. Oh yeah, don't get to worked up over it. I mean it-it sounds like he's a doctor, but he's not.
Oh no-no, I'm fascinated by paleontology. Have you read the new Walter Alvarez book?
Yeah! I-I teach it in my class.
Oh my God! I'm standing at a cash register, holding a credit card, and I'm bored.
Oh, I love your neighborhood. There's a great gym right around the corner from your building.
That's my gym.
I can tell you work out. A paleontologist who works out, you're like Indiana Jones.
I am like Indiana Jones.
Hi Pheebs!
Hey! Oh, how did baby shopping go?
Oh, it was great! We got everything that we needed! Oh and Ross, almost got something that wasn't on the list. A whore.
What?!
Well, we were paying for our stuff and this saleswoman just started flirting with him.
Well did she know you two weren't married?
Yeah.
Oh my God! Well the idea of a woman flirting with a-with a single man, we-we must alert the church elders!
You don't understand! You didn't see how brazen she was.
Sounds like you're a little jealous.
No! I'm not! I-I-I just think it's wrong! It's-it's that I'm-Here I am about to pop and he's out picking up some shop girl at Sluts 'R' Us!
Is that a real place? Are they hiring?
Hey Phoebe! Fatty!
Hey Chandler, why so fancy?
Well, I got a job interview. It's kinda a big deal too. Its a lot more money and I'd be doing data reconfiguration and statistical factoring.
Wait, I think I know someone who does that.
Me! I do that. So... Seriously, do I look okay? I'm little nervous.
Oh yeah! You really-You look great.
Yeah, just don't get your hopes up.
Why not?
Well, the interview...
What about it?
Y'know! You don't make a very good first impression.
What?!
Oh you don't know.
Are you serious?!
Yes, when I first met you, you were like, "Blah, blah, blah." I was like, shhh!
What is it that I do?
Well it's just like you're trying too hard. Always making jokes, y'know, you just-You come off a little needy.
Did you like me when we first met?
Chandler, I'm not gonna lie to ya, but I am gonna run away from you.
Hi! Umm, I'm Monica Geller, I'm the chef at Alessandro's.
Still?
I think the things that you said about me are really unfair, and I would like for you to give my bouillabaisse another chance.
I don't see any reason why I would do that to myself again.
Either eat it, or be in it.
Spoon? So, what do you think?
I'm torn, between my integrity and my desire to avoid a beating. But I must be honest, your soup is abysmal.
Thata girl! Huh? We should get out of here; there's a new class comin' in.
Welcome to introduction to cooking. Now, before we start, can anyone tell me the difference between a hollandaise sauce and a bearnaise sauce?
I can.
Okay, go ahead.
Well umm, they both have a egg yolk and butter base, but a bearnaise has shallots, shirvel, and most importantly tarragon.
That's very good, what's your name?
Monica.
Monica, you go to the head of the class.
Okay.
All this stuff takes up a lot of room. Hey how uh, how serious are you about keeping Ben in your life?
My son? Pretty serious. Oh hey Katie! What uh, what are you doing here?
Well, the delivery went out to you and I realized they forgot this.
Ah, must've been fairly obvious since it was the only thing left in your store.
Listen, to be honest, home deliveries are really a part of my job description.
Oh.
Oh uh...I actually came here to ask you out.
Oh! Wow! Uh, yeah! That sounds great. I'm just gonna put this back in my pocket, pretend that didn't happen. Uh yeah, actually I'm free now. Do you wanna grab some coffee or...
Sure!
Horny bitch. No! You're a horny bitch! Noooo! You're the horny bitch! No! You're a horny bitch!
So you guys go, have a really good time.
Yeah, I'm just gonna grab my coat. And uh, and my whip. Y'know because of the Indiana Jones? Not-not because I'm-I'm into S&M. I'm not-I'm not into anything weird. Y'know? Just-just normal sex. So, I'm gonna grab my coat.
So, you had a good day huh? Big commission; picked up a daddy.
Are you okay with this?
Oh yeah! Yeah please, you guys have fun.
Okay. It was nice to see you.
Oh and it was great to see you too. And you look fantastic, although you missed a button.
Oh umm, actually I umm...
Oh okay, I see what you're doing there.
I can't even believe this! I really come off that badly?
Oh! It's okay, you calm down after a while and then people can see how really sweet and wonderful you really are.
Oh good. Good, because I'm sure this interview is gonna last a couple of weeks.
All right, don't freak out! Okay? I-I will help you. How long before you have to leave?
An hour.
I can't help you.
Phoebe!
All right, all right, we'll just do our best. Okay? So let's say I'm the interviewer and I'm meeting you for the first time. Okay. "Hi! Come on in, I'm uh, Regina Philange."
Chandler Bing.
Bing, what an unusual name.
Well you should meet my uncle, Bada. I'll let myself out.
Hi.
Your Fettuccini Alfredo looks a little dry, did you use all your cheese?
When you say used, do you mean eat as a pre-cooking snack?
And the cream?
Cheese makes me thirsty.
Okay. Let's move on.
All right.
Oh! Something smells good over at Monica's station! Oh my God! This is absolutely amazing! You've never made this before?
Oh no! I don't know anything about cooking. I had to ask someone what it's called when the, when the water makes those little bubbles.
Well, hats off to the chef.
I-I-I'm sorry, your-your mouth was full, I didn't hear what you said. Umm, hats off to who now?
The chef!
That's right.
...I think you'll find if I come to work here, I don't micro-manage. I don't shy away from delegating.
Um-hmm, that's good to know. But let's stop focusing on what you don't do, and start focusing on what you do do.
What I do do...is manage to uh, create an atmosphere of support for the people working with me.
I see. Nice sidestep on the do do thing by the way.
Hardest thing I've ever done in my life.
You gotta go!
Oh!
Okay, don't worry. You're ready.
Really?
Absolutely! Just fight all your natural instincts and you'll be great.
Okay.
Ah Monica, my star student.
Y'know, you called me that before so I-I took the liberty of fashioning a star out of aluminum foil. Now, no pressure, you like my cookies, you give me the star.
Oh, yum-yum-yum.
Wow! A star! I know you all hate me and-and I'm sorry, but I don't care.
Okay Joey, you're up next. This are good! This is amazing! You get an A!
I can an A? In-in school? Hey, I'm a dork.
Joey! I'm so proud of you!
I think you should give him your star.
Excuse me? He doesn't even know what he's doing!
We're all beginners here. Nobody knows what they're doing.
I do! I'm a professional chef! Oh relax! It's not a courtroom drama!
If you're a professional chef, what are you doing taking Introduction to Cooking?
Yeah!
I'm-I'm sorry, it's just that umm... Well I-I cook at this restaurant, Alessandro's, and umm I just got a really bad review...
Oh Alessandro's! I love that place!
You do?
Oh yes! You're an excellent chef! As a person you're a little...
Oh, I'm totally crazy, but you-you like the food?
Very much.
Okay then, I don't stink. I'm a good chef. Okay.
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! I don't want to go. I'm having fun.
Well actually, did either of you pay for this class?
Hey-hey-hey, if my friend says it's time to go, it's time to go.
...also I was the point person on my company's transition from the KL-5 to GR-6 system.
You must've had your hands full.
That I did. That I did.
So let's talk a little bit about your duties.
My duties? All right.
Now you'll be heading a whole division, so you'll have a lot of duties.
I see.
But there'll be perhaps 30 people under you so you can dump a certain amount on them.
Good to know.
We can go into detail...
No don't I beg of you!
All right then, we'll have a definite answer for you on Monday, but I think I can say with some confidence, you'll fit in well here.
Really?!
Absolutely. You can relax; you did great.
Yeah I gotta say thank you, I was really nervous. Y'know I've been told I come on to strong, make to many jokes, and then it was really hard to sidestep that duty thing. Duties. Duties! Poo.
Poo?
Oh my God this doesn't count! Okay? The interview was over, that was the real Chandler Bing in there, this is just some crazy guy out in the hall! Call security! There's a crazy guy out in the hall!
Poo?!
I'll look forward to your call.
Hey.
Hi! You're back from your date!
How are you?
I'm fine, but that's not important. What's important is how was she?
Uhh, it was fun. We, we just had coffee.
Oh uh-huh, uh-huh, coffee, a little rub-rub-rub under the table.
What's uh, what's going on? Do you not, do you not like Katie?
No! No, she's-She was nice. I mean, she's a little slutty, but who isn't?
I liked her.
Of course you did Ross, you would date a gorilla if it called you Indiana Jones!
Did you get like a fresh batch of pregnancy hormones today?!
No! It's just that, Kate bothered me.
Why? What was wrong with her?
There was nothing wrong with her! All right? She was perfectly lovely!
Okay, so what's the matter?
I don't want you to date her!
Why? What, what are you jealous?
Yes! And not because I want you to go out with me, but because I don't want you to go out with anybody! Okay? I know it's a terrible thing to even think this, and it's completely inappropriate, but I want you to be at my constant beck and call 24 hours a day! I'm very sorry, but that is just the way that I feel.
Okay.
What?!
I won't date. I'll uh, I'll be here, with you, all the time.
Really? But I'm being so unreasonable.
True, but you're allowed to be unreasonable. You're having our baby.
Oh Ross, thank you. Thank you.
Do you feel better?
No, not really. You're pressing the baby into my bladder and now I have to pee. Sorry.
Uh Rach?
Yeah.
Just one thing umm...
Uh-huh.
We live together. You're having our baby. I'm not gonna see anybody else. Are you-are you sure you don't want something more?
Wow! I don't know, maybe. I'm...
Oh-oh, Rach! I was just messin' around! Like you did last night when I had to pee?
I knew that! I knew that! I was just messin' with you too!
Okay. Okay. Because for a minute you said you...
Oh no-no-no-no, no!
...that you actually...
No that's just--That's just 'cause I'm such a good messer!
Rach?
Yeah?
The bathroom?
Right!
Well I had a great time! Learned how to bake, ate great food, that's the first A I've gotten since seventh grade, and I didn't have to sleep with the teacher this time.
Oh, look! Acting for Beginners! Want to feel good about yourself?
What the hell!
Okay.
All right, let's start with some basics. Can anybody tell me what the difference between upstage and downstage is?
Yeah, this was a stupid idea.
Hey! What are you guys looking at?
Oh, it's a poster for that World War I movie that I'm in, check it out.
Yeah? Wow! It looks really violent!
Uh-huh! I know. I'm coming soon to a theater near you! I'm in THX! I'm unsuitable for children!
Now I cannot wait to see this.
Yeah, yeah, it's already generating Oscar buzz.
I started that!
I thought I did! Oh hey guess what? The premiere is next week and you're all invited!
Are we gonna take a limo?
Sure! Why not?!
Oh I love taking limos when nobody died!
Well obviously I won't be able to come, for those of you who haven't checked their calendars today is my due date. Well y'know, I just want to take a moment and thank you guys for how great you've been during this time. I really couldn't have done it without you. And I have loved these last nine months! And even though I am so looking forward to the next part, I am really gonna miss being pregnant.
That's right, still no baby! Come on people! Please make some room!
Uh sweetie, maybe you'd be more comfortable here?
You. Like you haven't done enough.
Look, I-I know how miserable you are, I wish there was something I can do. I mean I wish I were a seahorse. Because with seahorses it's the male, they carry the babies. And then also umm, I'd be far away in the sea.
God. I have never been so uncomfortable in my entire life!
Oh I know, I've been there. I remember toward the end...
Oh Phoebe, that's a great story. Can you tell it to me when you're getting me some iced tea? Oh God, get out! Get out!! Get out!! Get out!!
Let's.
Hey! Did you have the baby yet?
Do you want me to come over there and sit on you? 'Cause I'll do it.
What are you doing here so early?
They sent me home from work. They were like, "Start your maternity leave now! Just rest, get ready for the baby." Well y'know what? Screw 'em! If they don't want me there, I'll just hang out with you guys.
Or you can do volunteer work.
Hello?
Joey! It's Estelle! Great news, I was able to get you and one guest tickets to your premiere.
One guest? You told me I can have six tickets!
Well, I sold four of them on Ebay. You'll be sitting next to HotGuy372.
Oh my God. So that's it?! I only get to bring one guest?
Yeah, what time do you wanna pick me up? Hello?
Did you hear that? I only get one extra ticket to my premiere. So some how I have to pick between you three and Ross.
What-what about me?
You said you didn't want to go.
I don't. But I would still like to be acknowledged. What? Just because I'm pregnant you think I'm invisible.
Definitely not invisible.
Well, well Ross didn't care enough to be here, so I think he's out. You snooze you lose.
He's not snoozing, he's teaching a class.
Well then somebody's snoozing. Joey, not that this uh should affect you at all, but if you were to pick me, I was planning on wearing a sequined dress, cut down to here.
I haven't seen this dress.
Star in a movie.
Joey, you pick who ever you want. Okay? You just listen to your heart. What does it tell you? Phoebe, Phoebe.
Well uh...I think I want to take Chandler.
Phoebe-Phoebe-Phoebe-Phoebe-Burrrrr!
You really want to take me?
Yeah! Yeah! I mean I'm sorry, I wish I can take everybody, but y'know Chandler always supported my career. He's paid for acting classes and head shots and stuff and well this will be my way of paying you back.
So you're never actually going to pay me back?
Wait a minute, just because he paid for your head shots you're gonna take him? Joey, I don't think you're comprehending just how slutty this dress is!
It's not just the stuff he paid for, I mean it's-it's everything. Y'know? He read lines with me. He-he went with me on auditions when I was really nervous, and then he consoled me after I didn't get parts that I really wanted. You always believed in me man. Even, even when I didn't believe in myself.
I always knew you were gonna make it. I'm so proud of you.
Thanks. That means a lot to me.
Mon, maybe one of these guys wants to wear your dress.
I'm gonna go shave.
Yeah well, I'm gonna go spit.
Oh, I have to pee. If I don't come out in five minutes it's because I've choked to death on the potpourri stink.
When she comes out, you hold her nose, I'll blow in her mouth, and the kid will just right out of her.
She's over a week late! She gotta have it today, right?
I don't know. I-I think it's still gonna be a while.
Hmm, care to make it interesting? I'll bet you that she'll have it by this time tomorrow.
You're on!
Okay, how much?
One hundred thousand dollars!
How about fifty bucks?
Fine! I'll call Zurich and move some money around.
All right, who's turn is it to help me get up!
No one's here! Oh damnit!
This is so exciting! It's so glamorous! People taking our picture. How do I look?
A little tall.
What?
Do you mind crouching down a little bit, so that I look taller? There you go.
It's just so glamorous.
Oh hey Mon? Rach is here! Ohh, you're still pregnant. Oh, I'm sorry. I know how uncomfortable you are. Y'know what? You look great. Yeah, like fifty bucks.
Oh, I have to go pee. Apparently this baby thinks that my bladder is a squeeze toy.
Damnit! Damnit!! Here's your fifty bucks!
It's interesting that you lost. Now, I forget, do you like to lose?
Now stop it! Double or nothing that she has it by tomorrow!
Fine! You're on!
Okay.
Until then, General Grant, why don't you set up camp right there.
Hey is Rachel here? We have a doctor's appointment.
She's in the bathroom.
Rach, we gotta go.
In a minute!!!
People ask me why we're not together, I just don't know what to tell them.
All right, all right. Let's go!
Uh, do you wanna go change first? The doctor's keeping the office open late for us, but if you hurry...
No, I'm fine.
Really? You don't think that's a little inappropriate.
Good God man don't anger it.
Ross, it is 100 degrees outside. For the first time in weeks, I am somewhat comfortable.
Fine! Fine! Y'know what? Whatever you want. Okay? You're the mommy.
Oh uh-uh pal! Don't call me mommy! It's bad enough you call your own mother that.
I'm actually with her on this one.
"I thought I knew who the enemy was, but it was you all along."
Okay, this is it. It's my big fight scene coming up.
Ross.
Yeah?
Can I ask you something?
Uh-huh.
When Carol was pregnant with Ben...
Mmm?
...were you this irritating?
Wow!
Excuse me?!
Oh nothing. Nothing! Just uh, you've been a little short with me lately. I'm not trying to irritate you.
Well then you just must have a natural talent for it.
Y'know what? The doctor will be in soon, why don't we not speak until then.
Okay. Seriously, breathe louder Ross! That's great!
Y'know we should probably ask the doctor if she even knows how to deliver a baby that's half human and half pure evil!
Hi Dr. Long, how are you?
Oh, you're nice to her.
She has the drugs!
We'll do a quick check.
Okay.
So, eight days late huh?
Yeah.
You must be a little uncomfortable.
Eh, just a tad.
You're about 80 percent effaced, so you're on your way. It still could last a little while longer. If you're anxious there are a few ways to help things along.
Do them!!
Actually, they're things you can do. Just some home remedies, but in my experience I've found that some of them are quite effective.
Well, we are ready to try anything.
Okay, there's an herbal tea you can drink.
Okay.
You can take some caster oil, there's eating spicy foods...
Great! We will do all of those.
...taking a long walk, and then there's the one that's proved most effective: sex.
You've got to be kidding me!
Good job Joe! Well done! Top notch!
You liked it? You really liked it?
Oh-ho-ho, yeah!
Which part exactly?
The whole thing! Can we go?
Oh no-no-no, give me some specifics.
I love the specifics, the specifics were the best part!
Hey, what about the scene with the kangaroo? Did-did you like that part?
I was surprised to see a kangaroo in a World War I epic.
You fell asleep!! There was no kangaroo! They didn't take any of my suggestions! That's for coming buddy. I'll see you later.
Don't go! I'm sorry. I'm so sorry! Look! This guy fell asleep! He fell asleep too! Be mad at him! Or, call an ambulance.
Hey!
Hey.
Hi!
What did the doctor say? Any news on when the baby will come?
No. But she did give us some ideas on how to induce labor.
Yeah, we tried them all. We went for a walk, uh we tried a special tea, caster oil, spicy food nothing has worked.
Well, there is one thing that we haven't tried, but someone thinks that, "That will open up a can of worms."
Well what is it? What is it? If it's gonna help bring the baby here, like today. I mean, I think you should do it.
It's sex.
Do it!
Monica!
I'm just saying it's been a really long time for you. I mean, women have needs. Do it, get yours!
Oh I-I don't know about that. No, I think that if the two of you had sex the-the-the repercussions would be catastrophic.
All right, let's be practical, if Ross isn't willing to do it, he's not the only guy in the world you can have sex with. You can borrow Chandler-Chandler is good!
Monica, what is the matter with you?
Nothing. I just want the baby to be born today.
Why? Why today?
Okay fine! I keep betting Phoebe that you're gonna have the baby and I don't want to lose again!
What?! While she's been going through this hell, you've been making money?! You're betting on your friend staying in this misery?!
I'll take that bet.
What?!
Well, I'm miserable here! I might as well make some money out it!
Can I get some of that action?
Wait a minute! Now I'm betting against all three of you?
Oh honey, don't worry. I really do feel like tomorrow's the day.
Oh, okay!
Hey! Sleeping beauty!
Where have you been?! I tried to call you! I want to talk to you! I still feel so bad!
Oh no, were you upset? Did you lose sleep?
I'm so sorry.
Uh-huh look, the only reason I can over here was to settle things between us! Okay? You've done a lot for me and my career, I wanted to pay you back so I took you to the premiere but you missed it! Okay, so how much do I owe you?
What?!
Give me a number, I don't want to owe you anything!
You don't owe me anything, I don't want you money...
Ah-ah-ah! We're doing this! Okay, now you got me my first set of head shots. Right, how much were those?
I don't know, five hundred dollars?
Okay, five hundred dollars. What else?
Well then there was the second set, the infamous booger head shots.
Okay, so that's another five hundred. Five hundred and five hundred, that's...
Do you want a calculator?
Please!
Here!
All right, what else?
Well uh, there was acting classes, stage combat classes, tap classes...
Which we're still keeping under our hats!
Uh then there was that dialect coach who helped you with that play where you needed a southern accent. Which after twenty hours of lessons still came out Jamaican.
What the hell are you talking about, "The south will rise again man."
Yes, money well spent!
Yeah. Okay, what else? Rent!
Okay, two, three years of rent, utilities, food...
Okay. Okay, so I'm writing you a check for...So you fell asleep during my movie. Big deal right? How do you clear this thing?
Come on, finish your enchilada.
Ross I-We tried all the spicy food. It's not working.
Okay here, have one of these peppers. Oh ha... Oh God! So...so hot! Oh my- By the way, you don't want to touch the pepper and then touch your eye.
I am feeling nothing. Speaking of hot, watching you do that really makes me want to have sex with you.
Stop it.
Oh come on Ross, why are we wasting our time with this other stuff?! We know what's gonna work! It's doctor recommended!
I'm sorry, but we have to have some boundaries! My God, I'm dying.
Oh come on Ross, we've done it before we'll do it again, it'll be a nice way to bookend the pregnancy.
This is insane, I'm not gonna make love to you just so that you'll go into labor.
Make love? What are you a girl?
Always a great way to get in a man's pants.
But you will, you will be performing a service. Okay? Just-just think of me as a ketchup bottle, y'know you sometimes you have to bang on the end of it just to get something to come out.
I love when you talk dirty to me.
Oh, I know it. You're right. That's not sexy. Oh...Oh! Whoops! Oh, I seem to have dropped my fork. Let me just bed over and get it. Oh God!
Okay enough! This is, this is not going to happen.
Come on Ross! I'm miserable here! Come on! You started this, now you finish it! Come on wuss, make love to me.
Y'know what?
What?!
Forget it.
Oh wow! What now Ross you're not gonna talk? How on earth will you ever annoy me? Oh wait a minute, I know. I mean you'd think the damn jalepeno would've cleared up your sinuses, but no!! That's not enough... What are you doing?!
I'm getting that baby out of you!
Oh God!
Oh, I know.
Oh no. No-no! I think my water just broke.
I am good. Okay! Okay! Uh, I got the pillow! I got the bag! You got the keys?
Okay! I got the keys! Okay! Okay!
Hey!
Yeah.
We're having a baby.
I didn't uh, really have time to read this part of the books, but do you think we have time to...
Not so much.
Okay.
Two hundred.
Thank you!
That's it. I'm done. I don't care when the baby comes, no more betting.
Okay.
Hello? Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Okay. I guess we can bet one more time.
Is Rachel having the baby?
How did you know that?! Joey! Chandler!! It's time!
They're at the coffeehouse.
You know everything!! Oh wait, double or nothing. I bet you the baby is over seven pounds. I bet you it has hair. I bet you it's a girl.
We know it's a girl!
I'll give you really good odds.
All right! Yes!! From home to the hospital in under seven minutes! We did it!!
Yes, the hard part is truly over.
No, but come on, we're off to a great start aren't we? I knew I'd get you here fast, but this has got to be some kind of a record!
Oh you made it!
Hi!
How are you doing?
Wait a minute! How-how the hell did you beat us here?
We took a cab. Did you guys walk?
N... No! We took a cab too, but I did test runs!
Hi!
Hey! You made it!
Okay is there...some kind of magic tunnel to this hospital?!
Ross, you stay here and talk, I'm gonna go have a baby.
Okay. Okay. Umm hi, this is Rachel Green. I'm Ross Geller. We-we called from the car.
Right! We have a semi-private labor room waiting for you. So in just a minute...
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! I'm sorry, semi-private? We , we asked for a private room.
Yes, I see that here. Unfortunately we can't guarantee a private room and currently they're all unavailable.
Man, if only you'd gotten here sooner.
I'm sorry. Semi-private rooms are all we have.
Okay. Just give us a second. Ross!
Yeah?
Give her some money.
I really think they're out of rooms.
They're not!! Ross, they're just saving them for the important people!! Okay?! What-what if I was the president?!
Well then we'd be in a lot of trouble, you don't know where any countries are. Okay. Uh, say would you umm... Would you mind checking again to see if any umm, private rooms may have opened up?
This is a hospital.
Okay. Y'know what? I'd have to say I really don't care for your tone. And this is not the only hospital in this city and we have no problem to-Whoa! Oh gosh! Whoa!
What-what?
Ow! Ow! Contraction. Ow-ow! Ow-ow!
Would you like to see a semi-private room?
Yeah, it couldn't hurt to look.
Well you're only two centimeters dilated and we need to get to ten. It'll be a while.
Oh, okay.
I'll be back in an hour to check you again.
Thank you.
Thank you. Well, I guess we have some time to kill.
Yeah, guess so. Whew! Check these out! Never done this before.
Yeah well it looks great!
Thank you very much.
Thanks.
Hi! Hi, I'm uh Ross. I'm here to ruin this magical day for you.
Oh no-no, not at all.
Don't worry about it.
Marc Coreger, this is my wife Julie.
Hi Julie.
Hi.
This is Rachel.
Hi!
Oh hi Rachel.
How are you?
Hi. Is this your first?
Yeah it is.
Well, little Jamie here is our third. So, if you have questions or you need anything at all, just holler.
That's so sweet.
Yeah.
Oh.
Umm say, I-I opened this earlier but let me give you guys some privacy.
No nonsense! We're all in this together.
Yeah, we are going to share every moment of this with you. And I think we're gonna have some fun.
Yeah.
Oh, okay.
Hey! Smile!
Oh no, I really don't want any--Oh! Thank you. Oh. Oh Ross...
What?
Here comes another contraction.
Oh. Okay, just breathe.
Oh honey, I think I'm having one too!
Look at this! There we go!
Oh wow, three hours and still no baby. Ugh, the miracle of birth sure is a snooze fest.
Hey, you wanna see something?
Sure! What?
Umm, this is going to be fun. Watch me freak out Chandler. Honey?
Yeah?
Listen uh, I-I've been doing some thinking, and I don't know whether it's because we're here or Rachel's giving birth but umm, I think we should try to have a baby.
Okay.
What-what-what's that now?!
Okay. I've been thinking about it too, and I, I think we're ready.
What?! Are you kidding me?! You-you-you think we're ready to have a baby now?!
Oh, this is fun.
You're ready to have a baby? My boy's all grown up!
But you said you were ready too.
Yeah but I was just screwing with you to try to get your voice all high and weird like mine is now!
Yes, but haven't you wanted a kid like forever?
Okay, just back off mister! Whoa. 'Cause I am ready to have a baby. I just want Joey to be the father.
What?! Are you crazy?!
That's it! Right there! Is all I wanted!
I am so sorry. The doctor insisted on closing the curtain for the exam.
Oh, that's very-Really very-very okay.
Julie's cervix is dilated a seven centimeters, that's about four fingers. The doctor let me feel it myself.
Have you felt Rachel's cervix Ross?
No, I don't think we'll be doing that.
We're not gonna do that.
Well, if you like you can feel Rachel's and then feel mine to compare.
Am I interrupting?
Uh yes! Thank you.
Oh. Oh wait no.
Later.
No-no-don't! Don't leave me here with these people.
Oh uh, I'm sorry.
No Ross! Ross! Ross! My child has no father!
Hi! I'm so glad you're here, but it's gonna be a while. I-I wished you'd called first.
Oh that's all right, I'm coming back later with your father.
Oh good.
I actually needed to talk to you before the birth.
Okay, what's up?
I brought something that I want to give you, assuming of course that you want it.
Ma, you're asking me to marry you?
This is your grandmother's engagement ring, I want you to give it to Rachel.
Mom no, come on! Thank you.
Just hear me out!
N-no! Okay? We've been through this! We're not gonna get married just because she's pregnant, okay?
Honestly! Ross, this isn't just some girl you picked up in a bar and humped. A child should have a family.
Mom, y'know what? I-I can't deal with this right now. I'm sorry...
Just...think about it. If you don't, I'll talk more about humping.
Gimmie!
Hi!
Oh hi dear!
Oh, thank you so much for coming. Ross, get in here!
...she came and dragged me out of the labor room to ask me why I'm not with Rachel.
Yeah. Why aren't you with Rachel?
Are you kidding? Look, we're not gonna be together just because we're having a baby. Okay?
But y'know what? It just seems that you two belong together.
Okay, stop it! I can't deal with this right now. I have to go have a baby.
Right. And with who again?
God. He's crazy! Why doesn't he want to be with Rachel?
I know!
I mean seriously, she's like the perfect woman. I mean I know she turned me down, but if she hadn't and wanted to be with me, I would take her in my arms and... I haven't bummed you guys out like this in a while have I?
Hey. Who's that?
New people.
What happened to the Disgustingtons?
They're having their baby! It's not fair Ross we got here first! Right after you left they wheeled her off into delivery. Oh but not before she gave me a juicy shot of little Jamie just crowning away.
Wow! Sorry. So uh, how are the new people?
Well they have uh, some unusual pet names for each other. Including umm, evil bitch and uh, sick bastard. Oh God oh! Contraction!
Yeah? Okay.
Ooh! Ow!!
Are you looking at her?!
No!
Don't you look at her you sick bastard!
Honey I swear! I wasn't looking at her!
She's in labor! You like that you sick son of a bitch!
Umm. Umm, I'm-I'm just gonna-
See? See? It was because you were looking fat pervert!
No-no, I'm...I'm sure no one was looking. Just want some privacy.
You miss your girlfriend?
Just ignore them.
Ross.
What? What?
He's looking at me.
Hey! You wanna live to see your baby?!
Don't you talk to my husband like that you stupid bastard!
Oh good God! If you want a baby so bad just go steal it!
What is going on with you? Since when are you so crazy about babies?
I'm not crazy about babies. I'm crazy about us.
What?
Look, we've always talked about having babies someday. I'm not saying it has to be right now, but I'm starting to think that we can handle it. We're good. We're really good.
We are pretty good.
But nothing has to happen until your ready.
Well maybe I'm ready now. I mean, it's a little scary, but maybe it's right.
What?! It's not right! We're not ready to have a kid now!!
What?!!
I'm kidding. This is going to be fun.
So we're gonna try? I mean, are we trying?
We're trying to get pregnant. Y'know I'm not really comfortable doing this in front of the babies. So, when do you want to start trying?
Okay, hold on a sec.
Period math?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, we could start trying. Now.
Right here?
No, not here. Maybe here.
Wait a minute, it's perfect. We got a lot of time to kill and we're in a building that's full of beds!
And it's so clean!!
Come on you stupid machine! Come on!
Oh, it ate your money?
No.
All right, I'll see you downstairs then.
All right.
All right.
Hey I got one! I got one!
Hi!
Hi.
Oh uh, up or down?
Oh down please. I-I hate to be a ball buster can I just do it?
Could you press up too please?
Sure! I feel so bad for you; I broke my leg once too.
Oh yeah? How'd yours happen?
Well, it's a long story. It's kind of embarrassing. Let's just say there was a typographical error with a sex manual. How about you?
Car accident.
Oh.
Oh, let me guess some idiot on a cell phone wasn't paying attention?
Yeah. Me. Oh hey, that's me. Hey uh, I take it you're just visiting someone.
Uh-huh, yeah.
Well umm, if you have sometime y'know and maybe you might want to visit someone else...
Oh yeah! I-I would like that.
I'm in the middle...
Wait! What?! No!! Elevator!! No!
Uh, you gotta press the button.
The nurse said they're bringing in another woman.
Ugh, is she pregnant yet? She doesn't need to be; she'll still have the baby before I do. Oh Ross, another contraction!
That's it. That's it.
Oooh, that sounded like a bad one.
Yeah it was.
Mine haven't been so bad. Oh! Here comes one now. Oh, that was a big one!
Excuse me? Could you help me with something? The patient I'm looking for has a broken leg and is in a wheelchair. And umm, he's like early to mid-thirties, very attractive.
I think I know who you're talking about.
Oh yay! Great! Okay, what room number is he in?
I'm sorry, that information is restricted to hospital staff...
Uh, she's with me. Dr. Drake Remoray.
Dr. Drake who?
Remoray. It's Portuguese. We need that information; I'm a doctor.
A doctor at this hospital?
Damnit woman we're losing precious time! Now do you want this man's blood on your head?
Hands.
Hands! It is absolutely essential that you tell me what room the man my assistant described is staying in. He's a patient of mine, I've been treating him for years!
He's in room 816.
816, thank you!
Thank you.
And what is his name?
No!
I think we found a place.
Okay.
Umm, wait! Do you want to set the mood a little?
Okay. Uh, we'll dim the lights, dim the lights. Or turn them out all together. Uh, no scented candles. Okay here. Here we go.
Okay! Okay! Make me sterile, but okay.
Okay. Let's hurry-Oh wait! Do we have a condom? Oh right!
Yes, 98.6. You're gonna be fine.
Ooh, this is it! Oh, that's him! That's him!
Great! Go get him.
Wait a second, or maybe you can go in first.
He's not really my type.
No not you, Dr. Drake Remoray. You can ask him questions and see what's he like. People tell doctors everything.
But you said he was this great guy!
But lately all the guys I meet seem really nice at first, then they turn out to be the biggest jerks.
You do attract some stinkers.
Dr. Long, I've been at this for seventeen hours! Three women have come and gone with their babies, you gotta give me some good news! How many centimeters am I dilated? Eight? Nine?
Three.
Just three?! I'm dilated three!
We are moving along, just slowly. Don't worry, you're doing great. I'll be back soon.
Hey, y'know what? I'm not waiting! I'm gonna push this baby out! I'm doing it! I mean it's what? Three centimeters? That's gotta be like this!
Actually it's more like this.
Oh stupid metric system!
Oh my. We're gonna need to take you straight to the delivery room.
Oh for the love of God!
It's coming! It's coming!
And here it is!
Oh come on!!
Hi! I'm Dr. Drake Remoray and I have a few routine questions I need to ask you.
Really? I've been dealing with Dr. Wells.
I know, but I'm a neurologist. And just to be on the safe side, Dr. Wells wanted a more comprehensive overview of you status so he sent me.
Dr. Wells is a woman.
That was a test. Good response. All right, full name.
Clifford Burnett.
Date of birth?
November 16th, 1968.
Age?
Can't you figure that out based on my date of birth?
I'm a doctor Cliff, not a mathematician.
I'm 33.
Okay. And uh, are you married.
No.
Oh really? So, 33 and still single, would you say you have commitment issues?
Are all the questions this personal?
Yes.
Well uh if you must know I'm a widower.
Oh that's terrible. I'm-I'm really sorry.
Yeah.
Hmm. Do you sleep with women and never call them again?
No.
Excellent! Excellent! And uh, finally, are you into any weird stuff y'know, sexually?
No!
Oooh, wrong answer.
This room's available.
Okay! Okay wait! You listen to me! You listen to me! Since I have been waiting four women, that's four, one higher than the number of centimeters that I am dilated, have come and gone with their babies! I'm next! It's my turn! It's only fair! And if you bring in one woman and she has her baby before me I'm going to sue you! Not this hospital, I'm going to sue you! And my husband he's a lawyer!
Uh Rach...
Go get back on that case honey!
I don't think the next patient is very far along.
Okay, well then bring her in.
OH....MY....GAWD!!!
I....can't....believe this!
And yet somehow it's true!
I mean this is so great! We're gonna be baby buddies!
Squeeze your legs together and cover the baby's ears!
Hi sweetie!
Hi! Hi sweetheart! This is my husband Sid, I don't think you've met him. Ross, Rachel, this is Sid. I nabbed him a year ago at the dermatologist's office. Thank God for adult acne huh?
I still can't believe it! I'm the luckiest guy in the world!
Really?
What'd he say?
Oh y'know what? You have to speak very loudly when you're talking to Sid, because he's almost completely deaf.
Oh!
Oh there you go!
I get it!
So? Congratulations you two, I didn't even know you got married.
Oh we-we didn't.
No-no. We...
What?!
Um uh...We're-we're just having this baby together but uh, uh that's all.
Why?!!
Uh well umm...we're just not in that place, y'know? But we're very excited about this.
Oh. Well then shut me up.
Just tell me how.
Uh-oh, I feel another one coming.
Sid you lucky deaf bastard.
What else? What else?
Uh, well he's 33.
Oh. Ah-uh.
A widower.
Oh.
He seemed like a stand up guy. Oh, and he's not into anything weird sexually.
Enter Pheebs.
Should we tell Rachel there's an empty private room right next door to hers?
We could, or we can have sex in it.
Well let me think about that, while I remove my pants!
Okay mister! Fertilize me!
Does that sound like Janice?
If it's not, then there's two of them. And that would mean it's the end of the world!
Hey!
Hey!
Hi.
Oh hi.
I can't believe this is taking so long. How are you doing?
Oh not bad. Do you know that feeling when you're trying to blow a Saint Bernard out your ass?
Weirdest thing. Did I hear--Mother of God it's true!
Chandler Bing!
Jan-Janice!
Not just Janice, Janice in labor, contracting and everything.
Oh, this should be easy. I have a very wide pelvis. You remember Chandler.
Janice I didn't even know you were pregnant! Who's the unwitting human who's essence you've stolen?
It's you. This is yours.
What?!
Look how nervous he gets! We haven't slept together in years!
That's funny. Does it-does it hurt? Does the labor hurt?
Okay I've got one for you, if you had too which one would you rather eat, a seeing eye dog or a talking gorilla?
I'd have to say...the talking gorilla, because at least I can explain to him that you're making me eat him.
Somebody went to college. Wow. What is it? I'm sorry.
No, I'm sorry. It's just my foot itches like crazy.
Oh, I'll get it.
Wow! I usually get to know a girl a little better before I let her spoon me.
Relax, it's not like we're forking.
Oh that's five Ross. Five women have had five babies! And I have had no babies! Why doesn't she want to come out?
Y'know what I think it is? I think you've made such a nice home for her over the last nine months that she just doesn't want to leave.
Oh. Look at you making up crap for me. Oh God!
Twenty-one hours, you're a hero.
Doctor you gotta do something! I think you gotta give me drugs or you gotta light a fire up in there and just smoke it out.
Actually, I think you're ready to go to the delivery room.
What?
Ten centimeters, you're about to become a mom.
My God. Okay. Ha-ha-ha beat ya! Sucker!
Is this the same spoon that was in my cast?
Y'know what? This one is.
Oh my God! That's the doctor who was in my room before!
Huh. Okay, Mr. Perkazet.
I'm telling you! The guy from that show was here in my room, asking me all these weird questions!
Cliff, do you really believe that a character from a TV show was here in your room?
Rachel's having her baby!! Which is of no interest to me, I'm a neurologist.
That-that's him! You know him?
Okay. Okay. I-Okay umm...this...I-I sent my friend Joey in here to find out stuff about you. Umm y'know, if it helps you came off great. A lot better than I'm coming off right now.
I don't believe this. You got him to pretend he was some fake doctor?
Fake? Excuse me? Hello?
And then you tried to make me think that I was crazy.
You're right, that was wrong. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. It's just that I liked you so much. Can we just, can we just start over?
I don't think so.
Uh, if I may? Umm-umm look, Cliff, you told me a lot of personal stuff about you, right? And maybe-maybe it would if-if would help if-if you knew some personal stuff about her. Uh, she was married to a gay ice dancer. Uh, she gave birth to her brother's triplets. Oh! Oh! Her-her twin sister used to do porn!
Uh Joey, we're trying to dial down the crazy.
Right!
Umm, look we don't, we don't really know each other so it would be really easy to just forget about this, but there seems to be something between us. And I don't know about you but that doesn't happen to me a lot.
It doesn't happen to me either.
Me neither.
Push. Push. Come on push for five seconds. 5...4...
3-2-1 oh!!
Okay, the next contraction should be in about twenty seconds.
I can't. I can't push anymore, I can't.
Sweetie you're doing great.
Oh God twenty seconds my ass!!
Here we go! Okay, keep pushing! Wait! I see something.
What? You do? You do? Oh my God!
Don't say, "Oh my God!" Oh my God what?
What is that?
It's the baby's buttock, she's breech.
Oh thank God, I thought she had two heads.
Oh God. Is she gonna be okay?
She's gonna be fine. Okay, she's in a more difficult position so you're gonna have to push even harder now. Go! Push!
Go!
Rachel you're gonna have to push even harder, nothing's happening!
I'm sorry, I can't!
Yes you can!
I can't!
Hey! Hey! Come on! You can! I know you can do this! Let's go!
I can't. Please, you do it for me.
No! Come on let's-One more time! One final push! Ready? 1...2...3!
Good!
Keep pushing!
Are you okay?
You have no idea how much this hurts. Keep going! Keep going!
Here we go!
Oh! Oh! She's upside down but she's coming! She's coming!
Oh God!
Oh! Oh my God oh! Oh my God she's here.
Oh she's...she's perfect.
Oh, she's so tiny. Where'd she go?
Oh it's okay. They're just-they're just wrapping her up.
Okay. Well be careful with her, she's really tiny.
Here she is!
Oh hey you. Thanks for coming out of me. I know. Oh. Yeah. Oh, she's looking at me. Hi! I know you.
Do we have a name yet?
No, not yet.
That's fine, for now we'll just call her Baby Girl Green.
Oh no, Baby Girl Geller-Green.
Hello baby girl.
Can we come in?
Oh, come in.
Hi!
There she is!
Oh, she's so beautiful.
Here.
Oh my God! She's amazing. Oh, oh I'm so glad you guys got drunk and had sex!
It's incredible, I mean one minute she's inside you and then 47 hours later here she is.
She looks so real! Y'know what I mean! She's this whole tiny little person. She already has eyelashes and knees and...uh-oh.
What?
Oh no-no, no for I second there I counted six fingers, but one was from the other hand so we're good.
Okay, my turn. My turn. Oh! You're so cute! Oh, I could squeeze your little head! I won't.
What's the matter?
Oh nothing I... Sorry, I just can't stop crying.
The doctor says it's completely normal with all the hormones. Plus, you-you're sleep deprived.
So? You guys are all sleep deprived. I don't see you weeping because you put your slippers on the wrong feet. Oh God.
What's the matter now?
I was reliving it.
Ohhh.
So, do you know what you're gonna call her yet?
Oh, wait a minute it's not gonna be Baby Girl? I thought that was so original!
Uh actually, we-we've narrowed it down to two names.
Yeah, and y'know what? I love them both, so why don't you just pick one and that'll be it.
Wow! Umm, okay uh...everyone...this...is Isabella. What?
That's not her name! I'm sorry, she just doesn't feel like an Isabella.
So then I guess Ferdinad is out.
What was the other one Ross?
Umm, Delilah.
Oh great! Suddenly she sounds like a biblical whore.
So I guess we're back to uh, Baby Girl.
Yay!
Well what are we going to do?
It's okay honey, you'll find a name.
Ugh, easy for you to say, you already know what your kids names are going to be.
You do?
Yeah, I've had them picked out since I was fourteen.
Oh no, it's gonna be named after some snack or baked good isn't it?
Well tell us! What are they?
Umm, okay. If it's a boy it's Daniel.
And if it's a girl?
I don't want to say.
Oh, just tell us! We're not gonna want it!
Okay. It's Emma.
Emma! See? I don't want it.
Take it.
What?
It's clearly an Emma.
Oh honey, but you love that name.
Yeah, but I love you more. Besides y'know, nothing goes with Bing. So I'm screwed. I mean... Oh, hi Emma. Yeah, that's you. You're our little Em. Oh what's that honey? What? Oh, you want a little cousin? You want a cousin right now?!
That was amazing.
I know. Hey, do you realize we may have just changed our lives forever? We may have just started a family. Nine months from now we can be here, having our own baby.
And if not, we got to do it on a bucket.
Yoo-hoo! Aaron Litman-Neurolic would like to say hello to his future bride.
Ohhh! Wow! He kinda takes your breath away doesn't he?
He's a keeper. How are you feeling?
Oh, I'm fine.
Can I just say, I really admire what you're doing. Just raising her all alone.
Oh, I'm not doing it alone. I have Ross.
Oh, sure. Now. But what happens when he meets somebody else and gets married?
Well then he gets a divorce, it's Ross!
I'm telling you Rachel, listen to Janice. They all say they're gonna be there until they start their real family.
Well I-That's never gonna happen with Ross.
Oh well that's what I thought about my first husband, now I'm lucky if my kid gets to spend the weekend with her father and the twins and little Ms. New Boobs.
Really?
I hate to be the one to say it, but honey you two are on your own.
Well... That's...y'know-That's-We've been alone for the last twenty minutes we're doing okay. Besides y'know what? I-I-Maybe we won't be alone, 'cause lately I-I-things have been happening between me and Ross, y'know? Right before I went into labor, we-we had this kiss. Y'know? So it might be the...the beginning of something.
Hey Janice!
Oh hi!
Who's this little guy?
Say hello to Aaron, your future son-in-law.
No-no. No.
I'm gonna leave the three of you alone.
Okay.
Bye.
Man! Did you see the kid on that nose?
Uh-huh. Y'know what I was, I was thinking about?
Huh?
Umm...that kiss before we left the apartment. That was some-something huh?
Yeah. Yeah, it really was. But we...we gotta be careful. We...we can't let that happen again, y'know?
Right.
I mean we don't want to go down that road do we?
No! No, of course not. No. That's why I brought it up. They didn't have any sodas?
Oh my God! I'm sorry, I was talking to this nurse, completely forgot.
That's all right. And so it begins.
Is she in there?
Yeah. She's putting her down now, that's her.
Oh!
Look at Emma!
I just can't decide who she looks more alike, you or Rachel?
Oh what are you kidding? She's gorgeous, it's all Rachel.
I'm sorry, for the last time, why aren't you two together again? No, I know. I know, because you're not in that place. Which would be fine, except you totally are.
It's...it's complicated okay?
Yeah that's true. Yeah, you love her. You always have. You have a child together. There is no right answer.
Look, we've been together. Okay? And then apart, and then together, and then apart, and now we have a baby. It's just if-if we got together again and it didn't work out...I could never do that to Emma. I mean she-she thinking everything- Oh that's...now me. What do they put something in the water in this place? Since Rachel and I we're doing really, we're doing really well right now.
I know. I know. I know. I know, and if you try to make it more you might wreck it.
Yeah, exactly.
Right. Or you might get everything you've wanted since you were fifteen.
Hey. I just saw a woman breast feeding both of her twins at the same time; it is like a freak show up here. What's the matter?
Nothing.
What is it? Hey!
Really it's nothing. I'm just...
Rach come on, what?
I've just been thinking about how my baby and I are gonna be all alone.
What are you talking about alone? What about Ross?
Oh please, he'll be with his real family, the twins and little miss new boobs.
Okay, how long was I watching that woman?
I'm just saying that y'know, someday Ross is gonna meet somebody and...he's gonna have his own life. Right?
Yeah, I guess so.
I just never thought I would raise this baby all by myself. Pretty dumb huh?
Hey, listen to me, listen to me...you are never ever gonna be alone. Okay? I promise that's not gonna happen.
Joey. Honey what would I do without you?
You don't have to worry about that okay?
Oh, hon can you grab me my other box of tissues? They're right on that chair under Ross's coat.
Sure.
Okay.
My God.
Joey.
Oh my God. Okay.
